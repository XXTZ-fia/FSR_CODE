"Xero Shoes Aqua Cloud, Minimalist Women’s Water Sandals with Extra-Grippy Sole","GET WET & WILD: Adventure-ready minimalist shoes that aren’t afraid to get wet! We’ve taken our ever-popular Cloud sandals, updated them with a grippier 6.5mm FeelTrue sole, and created barefoot sandals for women with extra traction. Take them paddleboarding, kayaking, canoeing, hiking, running, or strolling, and get the grip you need without losing the natural feel. And at a weight of just 4.4oz for women’s 7, Aqua Clouds float on water! This means you’ll never lose them to the lake or ocean."

Xero Shoes are known for comfort, but our new Aqua Clouds take it to a whole new level. The embedded, textured 3mm BareFoam layer now spans the entire footbed, while a shaped heel cup helps keep out debris. And just like the original Clouds, these hiking water shoes for women stay secured with our patented, pressure point-eliminating huarache-style lacing system."

Our lightweight barefoot shoes are proudly vegan, which means no animal products are used in construction. We’re also making more of our shoes with fast-growing, sustainable materials and transitioning to using recycled products. All in an effort to reduce our carbon footprint and take better care of our beautiful planet."

Our patented FeelTrue sole that lets feet bend and flex naturally, a low-to-the-ground design that allows you to connect to the world, and a wide toe box that gives toes room to spread."
