I bought 3 pair and now I'm buying 4 more!  I really struggle being tall and plus size with a long torso finding shorts.  I typically have to buy too big, which makes the gusset baggy and weird, or deal with a wedgie in the correct size.  And don't even get me started on inner thigh ride up!These shorts don't do ANY of that!  I was able to wear these HIKING and only occasionally had to adjust the inner thighs!  And for reference I am 5'8"", 240, and carry most of mt fat around my lower torso, rump, and inner thighs.  I don't know how they did it... there's a pretty heavy lining fabric and a very sturdy sewn down hem, but the fabric is slick, like fake satin (but not shiny)..anyway, somehow all of that seems to converge in them not being prone to riding up.Besides that the cut is super cute, really flattering.  The pockets are functional without adding bulk AND are sewn to the lining so don't wad up or wrinkle when washed!!!  I was really surprised at how well designed these are for the price!!  Highly recommend!",

I am absolutely 100% ALL for comfy clothes for day, night, work, travel, etc.  But these look very ""cheap"". The pattern is on the inner and outer of the shorts, so where there is a red leaf on the inside, there is ""white"" on the outside - this = the red making the white look PINK.  Nothing like the crisp white in the vendor photos.  See attached photos pointed out in blue.As far as fit, they are TTS if not a little big.  And again comfy, but the cheapness and color bleed-through means they can only go in my pajama drawer.",
