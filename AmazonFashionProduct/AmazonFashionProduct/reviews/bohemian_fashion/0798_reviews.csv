The negative: 1) The fit is not flattering - the way the style fit on me, at least, I looked like I was expecting a baby. Ugh. A smaller size would have been too tight across the shoulders/arms. So - pretty, but not a good choice. I decided to return the blouse immediately.  2) I had checked on the return policy; it was the standard ""free returns for any reason within 30 days."" I did the return online in my account, dropped off the package as directed at the UPS store, and then ..... I waited.  I got NO confirmation from Amazon. Status in my account showed only that the seller was ""waiting for item to be dropped off"". I chatted with an Amazon online rep who kept saying, ""you will surely get your refund."" but could not confirm that the blouse was indeed accepted. I messaged the seller, who told me to contact Amazon for help.  And there the status remained, for almost 4 weeks. Finally, a refund was suddenly issued to my account, so I did get my money back.

I am 5' 4"", 145 pounds, 34B and 31 waist.  I guess I was trying to not have to tuck the top into my jeans because I really don't like tucking shirts in due to my front gut, yet I wanted to still still show a little shape in my rear and thighs by having a shorter shirt.  I didn't think about how the rest of the shirt gets smaller too when it gets shorter and less baggy. 🙃🙄  It fits just enough to wear it out, but only if I act like a lady and don't move too much or lift anything or raise my arms above my head. I should have got a medium.  I love the embroidery and the v neck is not too low. It is very soft and pretty. It has a nice but tighter cami sewn into it on the inside. So it feels even tighter than it looks on me because I have to feel the smaller cami against my body while the world sees the larger flowing outer top. Not cheap feeling.  If I don't ever wash it, I might be able to get a couple wears out of it before it shrinks. Wash by hand in cold water is what I will do. As it is, it just barely fits in shoulder and chest. Arms are fine.  The video was a mistake, but it shows the top in real life so I included it. (Hubby was trying to take photos of the jeans for me.)",5

I own several of these tops, I prefer the black, it is more forgiving hiding wrinkles then the white ones and you can’t see through it.

On top of that the fabric is very soft. The only thing I do not love is lining; it is not cotton or breathable but even in this Florida summer weather I have worn it three times and I feel good. This is probably because the lining is more on the style of a camisole and the blouse itself is very flowy and loose. I washed it in the normal cycle with tap water temperature and dried in the normal cycle and there was no shrinkage. I wore it with some elastic skinny type pants and sandals.

The embroidery thread is delicate, soft and the colors are vibrant. Looks well made. I am happy with the purchase.  I generally wear a size 4 and am about 5’ tall so ordered in a small. It does seem to run on the large size, I would consider it more of a medium fit. It will be a good addition to my wardrobe when the weather warms up as it looks like it will not show sweat stains and will remain cool because of the loose fit. I like the black because it can be dressed up or down depending on what you wear with it.  The blouse care instructions are however inconsistent; both saying it can be machine washed and that it should be hand washed and not rung dry. My opinion, because of the embroidery, it should only be hand washed. I did consider giving it a lower rating because of large fit and the embroidery design on the sleeve does not go all the way around the arm, which I think looks unfinished, but this may not bother others.",2

I love me some bright colors and these don’t disappoint. I will probably be hauling this along to Mexico with me next month for the added sun protection and comfort in the Mazatlan humidity.  It’s fabric feels the same as my older shirts and I expect it will also last me a good long time (I hang mine to dry.). I hope you enjoy  yours as much as I do mine!",
