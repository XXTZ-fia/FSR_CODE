It’s 65% polyester, 35% rayon, 5% spandex. And it fits clingy. Ugh  The black and white shirt does not cling. It hangs so nicely, and even feels dressy, if that makes any sense.  Here’s my thing: why say it’s this, when it’s not. Ugh!!!  Now I can’t order more because I have no idea what I’m getting.  Just tell the truth so that we buy what we want to buy.
