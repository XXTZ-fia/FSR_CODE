MS,Weird Cut & Fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3F8KSZ2TADCZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SSTCF1M,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 14, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,Was like a rectangle lace tablecloth that arm holes were cutout of.

tabatha ferrell,Wish it was shaped different!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5P381A9PALV8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SSTCF1M,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 16, 2023",Size: One SizeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"So this is a nice piece of lace like material with a pretty fringe.  The problem is the shape. It's pretty much a rectangle with 2 long armhole slits. It's not made like a vest. That's why it lays funny in the front. The fringe goes all along the edge on the bottom ,great, but the 2 edges ,the short sides of this rectangle do not have fringe, so this bunch up occurs at the front . If fringe was on the short sides I think it would help the over all look. If it had some shaping like a vest it would help. The way it lays reminds me of the ""lace"" tablecloths u buy in the dime store. It's stiff so it piles up like a fan I guess. It's just so weird shaped. I was hoping to layer it for a Stevie Nicks kinda vibe,but it not quite happening. The lace pattern is gorgeous. I think I will try and cut the front or run some stitches to give it some shape .it looks great from the back and I don't mind the irregular hemline. I just really wish they had run the fringe on the short sides. Price was low ,about 22 bucks,so I guess it's not a bad deal if u can modify it. Hoping for the best .",

Mak,Design very off center in back,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3J7A8D040T8N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SSTCF1M,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2020",Size: One SizeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I like things that are a good pattern and symmetrical.  On the website it shows the pattern very centered in the back, with the V shape right in the middle, (at the bottom just before the fringes start.  When I received mine, the design didn't look anything like the online photo, and the design was off at least 2-3 inches to one side.  It makes it look cheap and haphazardly put together.  I contacted the seller to tell this, and asked if they had one as described and shown in the photo, and they replied that they did not have one.  I like the fabric and style in general, plus the overall lace pattern is larger and bolder in some areas.  But the back side should NOT look like this.  I am disappointed since I liked other aspects.  I have to return it since I would not wear it looking like it does.",6
