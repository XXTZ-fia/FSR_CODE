Ael,Not worth the money,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7CLTUIM1HFSW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XN5ST5B,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Color: #00brownSize: 4X-Large,Verified Purchase,The quality and fit is not worth the money. The fit is unflattering and the quality of the material is poor. The way the design came out isn't as advertised.,
Shawn A,I was disappointed.  Not like the pics,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV5S18XE48SS5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XN5ST5B,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 20, 2024",Color: 09pinkSize: 3X-Large,Verified Purchase,"This didn’t AT ALL fit me.  And the material was literally paper thin like a hospital gown.  It tied like that , too .  I thought I was ordering a casual, cute, fun outfit and I was hoping to wear it to lunch with my friend but it didn’t work out as planned.  I returned them both.",

I. D. Lara,Cute idea but the fabric leaves something to be desired . . .,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Z53QWQ237JVR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XN5ST5B,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 11, 2024",Color: #00brownSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I like the cut of the jumper and the print - bright flowers on a black background - but a cotton blend fabric would have been a much better choice. I'll probably take these apart to use as a pattern to make my own in a more breathable, summery print.",
Dorothy Curry,Love these,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PSL2C4ELE8O1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XN5ST5B,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 5, 2024",Color: #02whiteSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,I absolutely love there overalls.

HopefulRomantic,"Super Cute, Runs Small",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GV1GDJQ8MLVJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XN5ST5B,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 26, 2024",Color: #06navySize: 3X-Large,Verified Purchase,"These are the cutest overalls! I think the sizing may be a little questionable, though. Some reviews say true to size. Others say runs large. I wanted them loose, so I purchased a 3X. I normally wear an XL. These are just a step away from being too tight. Just be aware.",3
Amazon Customer,Nice product… but much too long for me‼️,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JLNZNBFGUSP7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XN5ST5B,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 15, 2024",Color: 02-whiteSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I was excited to receive this; but, much too long for me, thus my reason for returning‼️",
Joshua E Bohannon,DIY Clothing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WWCJPLCYZCBJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XN5ST5B,"1.0 "," the United States "," July 8, 2024",Color: #00brownSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,Hands down the most disappointing item of clothing my wife has ever bought (see our review of the Cupshe swimsuits for the bar this company had to beat).  Straps were sewn onto the wrong sides of the overalls so they wouldn’t actually work as clothing. Cut the straps and tied them to the correct half.  Top of the overalls is too small to cover even half of the chest of a child. Bought an XL. At my suggestion we turned them around and tried again to make sure we weren’t trying to use the back of the overalls as the front. We weren’t.  This was horrible.,11
Jodi,Amazon size recommendation perfect. But color was not the same,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZOE6998Y5KIU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XN5ST5B,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 27, 2024",Color: #00brownSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"The size that Amazon recommended was spot on.  The product material is quite a bit lighter in color then I wanted; the picture shows a darker brown background and the one that came was grayish, and a lot lighter in color, it is still beautiful so I’m keeping it.",
Kat,Horrible,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1U47O8KCR2O6O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XN5ST5B,"1.0 "," the United States "," June 26, 2024",Color: #00brownSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,Material and construction is cheap. Completely different pattern than the picture. States it's a poly/cotton blend but it feels like 100% polyester from the 80s. I sized up to an XXL as seller suggested and it's tight. Worst purchase ever.,10
Sheila,Cute but a little small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CZJO4GT4RKWQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XN5ST5B,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 25, 2024",,Verified Purchase,Not the material I was expecting but still like them. A little tighter in the hips too.,
SLR,Order size larger than sellers size chart,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YQXSZDU3EY50/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XN5ST5B,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 18, 2024",Color: #00brownSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"Cute. Comfortable. Light weight. The seller offers their own size chart (scroll to the right in pics), but you must order a size larger for the loose fit pictured. Also. The straps consisted of a loop on the front and a loop on the back the only way to use them is to cut them in half. A loop connecting the back to the front on each side would have allowed me to tie a knot to my desired fit without cutting the loop.",3
Alyssa,Size up if you're thick,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XAVSL36X4NHS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XN5ST5B,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 15, 2024",Color: #08wineSize: 5X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I ordered the wine version and it doesn't look like the picture. The design of it looks blurry (in person, the pictures look great) if that makes sense. It has more of a red tye dye thing going on rather than a ""boho"" or ""mandala"" pattern, but I'm good with that.  The straps are adjustable so you can tie them as loose or as tight as you need (a plus for me because I am a busty girl).  I assumed that it may have been Asian sizing, and took that chance, so I ordered the 5X since the 3XL said the hips were 51"" on the sizing chart. They are more of a snug fit on my hips and I typically measure between 52"" and 53"".  The material is lightweight and after a wash or two I imagine it will be softer; it just feels starchy right now. The legs are wider giving that baggier look, it's just the hips on me that doesn't give that baggy look. Just keep in mind if you are a thick girl!",32
G,So confused,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14ZVGA1M7IIA0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XN5ST5B,"2.0 "," the United States "," May 7, 2024",Color: #00brownSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"Love the print but the item received did not have spaghetti straps.  There was a single strap for the front and a single strap on the back, both of which run from side to side.  So, no way to tie them because they’re solid, so I cannot wear it as/is.  Not really sure what to do.",
Idaho Girl,Beautiful,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NOJ73VGOFV9C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XN5ST5B,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 6, 2024",Color: #05light GreenSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"I loved everything about this jumpsuit.  Fabric medium light weight, well made, and I loved the cost.  Only problem was the size runs WWWWAAAAYYYY to small.  I was so disappointed that I couldn't wear it.",21
Barbara,Not cotton and be careful with size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KBTZSHGL0CSK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XN5ST5B,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 29, 2024",Color: 02-whiteSize: Large,,"So I ordered two. I am 4’11 and about 124 lbs. long body very short legs (21”). I wanted them baggy but but not  grossly baggy I got 2xl (xxl) in both. They fit just as I hoped.  The fabric is not cotton at all I believe polyester/rayon and I am not finding them to be stretchy in anyway. Now I ordered one that was on sale - not seeing it anymore it is white with a burgundy rose design mostly to one side. This one is short it came above my ankles so one can imagine how short it really is and no pockets as promised in the description. I also got the blue kinda turquoise with the reddish color and and blues etch mostly to one side. These are long by about almost 2 inches excess material in flat feet,  this one has pockets that are literally in front of the garment not on the sides and it is designed with a kind of a little waistband. But it is baggy so it doesn’t accentuate anything. I bought them as it is hot in the summer in South Florida and I don’t wear shorts. I won’t return but won’t buy again as there is no consistency and not quite sure I like the fabric. I was hoping for a cotton blend as advertised. Feels almost like a plastic tablecloth but definitely not as still. Also I don’t know how to wash them. The label says dry clean and for what I paid I am definitely not dry cleaning and if I knew that it had to be dry cleaned I definitely would not have bought",6
