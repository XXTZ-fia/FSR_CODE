I could lounge around in these as easily as go out in them.  I got an XL and they were true to size.",3

The colors and design are very pleasing. The legs fit well and the length was fine. The issue I had was the “natural waist” where the elastic was… When you bend or sit, the “muffin top” is below the elastic, if that makes sense. Not only is this unflattering it’s very uncomfortable and cuts off circulation. The crotch sits way low (5 inches below inseam) and if you try to pull them up, they get tight in the buttocks and leaves and unfortunate from view… I really wanted to like these, but they are not made right. They did wash well and the wrinkles came out by hanging them. If the measurements were more “normal” these could have been great!",

These are the perfect length for me.  As you can see from the photo they fall right at my ankles.  They also have a stretchy waist that holds in place well but also offers lots of stretch.  You can easily pull them up higher on your waist for ""capri"" style or bring them down if you like them more on your hips.The material is ""100% Viscose"" which is another name for Rayon (based on a quick Google search).

The pants themselves have been made fairly well, with mostly neat stitching and few loose threads. Highlight- The pants have pockets! Generous pockets! They are a good fit, true to size. The elastic waistband makes these comfortable pants to wear in any situation. They are very lightweight material making them great for around the house, pool or at the beach but given the beige are see through, it makes them inappropriate to wear anywhere else unfortunately. I really wanted to love these pants but they’re just not what I was expecting. If you’re looking for a cover up type of pants then these would be good, if you’re looking for more everyday pants then go with something made from a thicker or less sheer material.",

They are so soft, incredibly cool to the touch, and ultra lightweight without being see through. The size chart says that the XL size should fit a waist of 32-35"" and that is correct.  These fit me perfectly, are ultra comfortable at the waist, but do not fall down.  I would not consider going up or down a size.  These pants have pockets, which you don't often find in this style.  You can dress these up or just wear them for lounging.  They have a finish that is neither shiny nor opaque, but rather egg shell like.
