It’s clean, simple and professional or casual with jeans. The color is flattering. The back is not a tailored fit and is not flattering, but doesn’t look bad. The seam is across the back above the waist, so slightly ballooning out. I have worn with white jeans or a suit. I’d purchase again, but the from side is the flattering side. I’m 5.3, 160 and purchased Med. I’m normally a Large. This blouse slightly fitted in my bust line and in this pic I have my back arm stretched, so you can see a pull across bustline. With arms down it fits, without a pull, but just barely. I’d purchase again.",10
