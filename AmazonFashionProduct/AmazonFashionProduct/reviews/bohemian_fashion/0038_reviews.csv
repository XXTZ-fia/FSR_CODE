It's flattering, colors are great and easy to dress up or down.  It has 2 drawbacks. 1 - It comes to you folded, so the wrinkles are extremely hard to get out. What I've found best to do is either soak it in water and iron it at a lower temperature while damp or else take it to a dry cleaners just to have professionally pressed. Once you get the wrinkles out once, you can wash and dry in the machines and it's much easier to keep unwrinkled that way. 2 - The buttons are extremely cheap and prone to dropping off. It's the loop in the back that gets sewn onto the shirt that brakes off easily. It does come with one extra button sewn to the tag. What I would recommend is taking super glue to the back of the button to make sure that that plastic loop does not come off. Other than these mild modifications, you will absolutely love this shirt.  The fabric is a slinky polyester, so it's very flowy, but not breathable. I live in AZ, so I may not be able to wear it in the middle of summer. The arms are larger, so it hides arm fat nicely. It does have a strip of fabric where the buttons gather, so It doesn't give a peep show. The v-neck is a tad bit low. I love it but just know that it's kind of low. When tied, the shirt lands in between the hips and the waist so it's very flattering. The colors are very nice and true to the pictures. I have black, white, Kelly, Green, sage green, hot pink, and orange sherbet. They're all very nice. The colors don't bleed in the wash. I bought the ice blue one as well, but returned it. It's more of a baby blue like you would see at a baby shower. I was looking more for an ice blue or Caribbean Blue  I usually wear between a large and extra large in tops. I bought a large and it's very comfortable on. It's more on the roomy side",22
