Lady Pancakes,Love these.

Had to get the xl size. I bought the brown one size but the waist stitching wouldn't go past my hips😫 hopefully they start making  that color larger too. The material is thick and sturdy, but, it's not hot at all. Wore to a concert in the middle of summer and didn't break a sweat. The waist has drawstrings but you can't tell its drawstring. They are definitely worth their price as far as construction and material. Very good quality. When they make new patterns....imma buy em🤣",15

Lasnab,Unique,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SZ0E0XBB21JS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1D2THSS,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 13, 2023",Size: One SizeColor: Shadow Slayer,Verified Purchase,This item is as stiff as it looks Yonkers the shape they’re going for. The material is not soft to touch like most Kurta Pajamas. Yet it is unique and I’m keeping it. I ordered to my size and I’m curvy so pls note that the waist is tight despite having the am elastic band had to wiggle in. Big booty small waist problems. The ankle is actually a slit with ties. A bit weird at first but then makes sense to adapt to all leg widths. It’s not going to be everyone’s cup of tea if you’re not used to Indian Kurta Pajamas.,5
