A.Teach,Great casual look,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UUSF7H0MC0N6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKF6LBST,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Gentle Orange,Verified Purchase,I just looove this top!  I now own several of these in different colors and patterns. The fit is true to size and it makes my waist look smaller than it is. The sides come up just a little but it’s attractive in the design of the top without revealing too much. I’m a busty girl and the pleats down the front somehow minimizes my bust.  I like the fabric and it is soft and doesn’t wrinkle when traveling. I’m impressed with the overall top for casual dress with jeans or dressier pants.  It’s my now favorite go to top for daily wear.,

I'm 5ft 4in and this top fits me perfectly.  I have long arms and the sleeves fit me with enough length to move around freely.  It has about a 3"" cuff.  I'm apple shaped and the styling and fabric drapes softly over my torso without making me look like I'm wearing a tent.  The length falls at lower hip length.  Washes and dries up beautifully.  These shirts are excellent Mainstays for your wardrobe and perfect for casual, office or formal wear.  Also great for travelling as they fold up small and don't wrinkle.  Great value for the money.",5

I am 70 yr old, 5,3”, big bellied 211 pounds, 42DD bra size. This top will be a favorite all winter. I tried a black long cardigan sweater vest over it and that worked well.

It looks very pretty on, and works for a range of occasions.  It goes from work to dinner very easily.  The fabric is very soft and the design is lovely.  I like the design touches like the tucking on the front, the tighter cuffs, and the gathered shoulders.  It fits quite true to size, and the length is flattering.",

If you order a solid color I’m sure you’ll be fine but buyer beware with the prints. I will be returning it,

It is very soft and comfortable. It drapes nicely. The sleeves are a perfect length, right to the knuckle on my thumb. I am 5'8"" tall. It does not look as long on me as it did the model, but it is a good length. The tucks leading into gathers give it some shape beyond a regular T-shirt. It is fairly lightweight but is loose fitting enough that you could wear a cami or turtleneck under it during cold weather. I would definitely buy again.",2

The purple color is a bit deeper than the photo shows but that doesn't bother me. It's perfect to wear as is a bit casual with jeans or a skirt. I'm also looking forward to wearing it in a bit more formal outfit with dress pants and a blazer. It's a very soft blouse and there is a nice subtle design on the front that has lines going down. It's also stretchy.,

It’s a little boxier than the photos and she doesn’t feel it fits her well as the size indicates it should. It’s pretty loose fitting and just doesn’t do it for her. Overall the quality is decent for the price but the fit isn’t there. It isn’t the size, it’s the fit.",
