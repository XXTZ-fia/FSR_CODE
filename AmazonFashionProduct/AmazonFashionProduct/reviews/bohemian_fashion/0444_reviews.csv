Gina Lonardo,LOVE these pants! Very comfy. Would definitely recommend,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R361BUZO7TK255/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B06XNS3HQM,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 3, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"I love these and wear them as often as possible! They're very comfortable and I plan to buy more pairs in other colors. They are a bit sheer, which is fine with the black pair, but I imagine white in this fabric would look see-through.  They're a little bit long for me, but I'm 4'11"", 100lbs, and I really don't mind the extra length because they're tighter around the ankle and kind of flop nicely around the feet. You can also pull them up to make them look like a capri style.  They fit well around the waist, not too tight but not loose. They generally have a loose, relaxed fit.  The cons: the pockets are in kind of an odd spot on the thigh and aren't really sturdy enough to carry things. The material is a bit thin so I would recommend hand washing them, or what I do is put them in a washable laundry bag with the washer on the hand-wash setting. You also need to wash them separately for at least the first wash because the color will run.",3
Kristen,"Comfort is 5, quality is 3, so I give them 4 stars.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHGDA688M5BQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B06XNS3HQM,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 20, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"First comment i have... I love these pants. This is the second pair that I have purchased, because they are just so comfortable and flattering. They fit really well. The first pair I own has significant thread pulling and seam separations, even though I've only worn them to lounge around in a couple times and never washed them.  They say hand wash, so thats what I plan to do when they need it. This 2nd pair is of the same quality. There are a couple of pulled or loose threads, even right out of the package never worn. I give the quality a 3 star... maybe even 2! I would expect to be able to wear a pair of comfy pants to lounge and do nothing in plenty of times before any damage to the seams, honestly. Especially for 20$. The pants fit really well and look good on. They're cool in the heat and breathable- but I don't notice that I can completely see through them as some people have stated in reviews. I included a picture with my hand inside, and you can make out my silver ring trough the fabric. That being said, if the quality of the fabric and seams can be improved a bit, these would be my absolute favorite to wear, 5/5 pants.",9
J. Kepler,"Incredibly comfortable, probably not incredibly durable",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QJSSVSCSVEQ5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B06XNS3HQM,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 14, 2020",,Verified Purchase,"For what they are, these pants are fantastic. They're comfortable, they fit well, and I love the blue color that I ordered. That said, this kind of pant in this kind of fabric are not going to last forever. With care they may last me a few years, but this fabric isn't super durable, so bear that in mind when making your decision.  For me, the pants are perfect. I'm 5'8"", 167 pounds, and they wear nicely on my hips a little below my navel, which is exactly what I want because I have a stomach condition that causes me pain when my clothes press on my belly. If I wore them up at my natural waist, I don't think I'd find them as comfortable and the length would be above my ankle. Wearing them a little below my navel has the length perfectly a little below my ankle bone.",

These are CRAP! Wore them once and they came apart! Washed them twice and the color bleeds! Was on a boat yesterday and sat on a white seat and because my bathing suit was wet, the dye bled through and the seat turned purple! I can just imagine what this dye is doing to my skin! Utter TRASH !!!!!!!!! Changed my 5 star rating to one and would do a zero if I could. Shame on this seller for selling such crap!!!  I just got mine today and absolutely love them. The material is super soft and they are super comfy. I am not expecting them to last a long time because the material is thin, but for $20, you can’t go wrong. I am ordering 6 more pair in different colors. They are perfect for warm weather, the beach, just chilling at home, even dressed up with a cute top and accessories. I am very happy with this purchase.",3
Tracy,Not quite as pictured,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U8NE3G61XDA7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B06XNS3HQM,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 19, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"So I was excited for these. Fit as expected in sizing. They appeard to be a cottony material online. They are more of a linen. They are quite see thru when held to the light. Not sure in actual sunlight as I have not worn them yet. They appeared to have tighter ankle, than they actually do. And unless you are under 5'3, they are not going to do that cute little fold at the bottom due to length too short and lack of tightness at the ankle. Pokets are not really usable, they are further down than appear online. The material is soft despite it being more linen than cotton. Color and pattern are nice. They felt comfortable, nice, for the few mins I had them on. I will provide a pic when I wear them.",2

I love the waist, which is about 10 rows of smocking, that make a flattering fit. They rest on top of my feet, not tight at the ankle, perfect. Others have complained about them tearing right away.  Just going to say these are not for heavier women that might put strain on the fabric and seams. I just wash them in the sink, cold water, squeeze them out, lay on a towel and roll up. I then hang them and gently smooth the wrinkles, they dry quickly. I love them so much I bought every lighter color! My only negative was the pockets, which are really just decorative. They were saggy, so I removed the bow and tacked the pocket closed.....just my preference.",29

imjenjen,Light but fabric too thin,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18HROIAI9O1K8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B06XNS3HQM,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 5, 2022",,Verified Purchase,"Ordered these blue boho pants in XL. I’m an 18 in Maurice’s vigoss Jean’s. 5ft tall and 205-210 weight. Didn’t even try these on because of the hole In belly. I wanted to have these work so badly! I am dying to find a light pair of loose pants for these hot Vegas days. Well, when you order light… it’s apparently too thin of a fabric. I loved the weight but I never even got to wear them once. The 1st pic is near the seam by the belly. In between crotch and waist. Look carefully and see the hole? I would understand a rip on the seam but the is next to the seam. 2nd pic is the inside crotch area. See how thin this fabric is? If the wind blows to hard these are going to split. There’s no way around it. Even if your a sz zero ordering these in an xl… this thin fabric will never even make it through a wash basin gentle hand wash. I’m serious when I say the wind will rip it. 3rd pic is of the inside of the pant near the right leg pocket. See the light coming through at the seam of the pocket? Well, it just enforces the reality that the fabric is just too thin. Guess what we ask for is not realistic when it comes to construction. You can’t have super light fabric and expect to wear it. 😬 A woman can dream of the day super light fabric won’t be see through and that you can actually wear the fabric without expecting it to fall apart before you even put it on once. I’m super sad I’ve had to come to this reality.",3
LN,Color runs a little,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EEDZQKO9YEFX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B06XNS3HQM,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 28, 2022",,Verified Purchase,"I purchased these pants in Blue as a bathing suit coverup.  After reading reviews I sized way up.  In US sizing for elastic waist pants I am normally a Medium, unless the cut is junior or athletic then I sometimes need a Large for my waistline.  Since I ordered an XL and am only 5'2"" they fit from my waist to ankle.  They are baggy in the bottom and thighs but since I often ride my bike to the beach, that's perfect and what I hoped for.I like that they are super light weight. Since other reviewers mentioned tearing during wash, I washed them inside a polyester lingerie bag in cold water with black clothes.  Unfortunately the lingerie bag has a blue tint - polyester using doesn't hold color well so the pants must have run a lot.  I'm hoping this was just a one time occurrence, if not I will update my review.I hung them dry and didn't notice any shrinkage.  No tears anywhere.  I'm a little nervous to wear them when I might be wet from my bathing suit and need to sit on light outdoor furniture.  But for the beach - they are perfect.",5

I am 5' 137, and took the advice of ordering size up and wished I had not. Small would have been fine, extra small probably would have been better! While wearing, this material has some give and feels more loose/ larger at the end of wear.....If you like extra loose, or have more junk in your trunk or thick thighs, your normal  size should do, or MAYBE consider ordering size up. Color did start to fade a little  into white on first day of wear ( did not wash, and no big deal, can barely see) washed on delicate and put in dryer on low to try and shrink.....did not damage pant.....

I wore them on a cruise and in one of the ports they had the exact pants for $49.99!I am 5'3"" and about 170 lbs and I ordered an XL.

I hand washed the first time and the blue dye just kept on coming so I put them in a mesh bag and ran them through the washer.  I don’t know if the dye still runs so this is my wash method of choice now.  The mesh bag has a slightly blue tinge now but I can live with that.  After hanging to dry, they were slightly wrinkled and that might be a problem if I ever left the house in them (or at all).  Because of the dye problem, these have to be washed alone so that’s another consideration.  All said, because I love the fit and feel I bought another pair in a different pattern.  I chose comfort and fit over washability but that’s just my personal choice.  I hope this helps you.",4
RexnRose,Loved how they felt and fit but they tore…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RKPW1WPZQY3N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B06XNS3HQM,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 19, 2022",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I was happy to find comfortable, breathable pants that fit my pear shaped body and even flattered it! Fit absolutely perfectly! Wore them for my Mexico trip (Tulum is especially boho) and I didn’t sweat or chafe or anything! Better than shorts ! Airy and a very nice pattern. Not too baggy but loose enough to flatter my big booty.  Sooooo bummed they tore in the crotch. I didn’t hear or feel them tear so I’m assuming it happened in the wash. I knew it was a possibility so I did delicate wash and hung to dry TWICE. Hand washed in Mexico once too. And that’s it! I might still order again, maybe a different color as the material looks a little different. They are very inexpensive so it’s not about the money it’s more that I really liked the fit and have a hard time finding well fitting clothes - I have high hips- quite wide, and a little extra in my waist. So I guess I would consider this a 2-3 use clothing which is kinda wasteful.",2

I also really can appreciate how affordable these pants are. They're great for wearing around day and night. I think they would make a great gift as well, and I'm planning on buying more in the future for myself, my friends and sister. I can't think of anyone who could not like to have a pair.  Update: I had to take down a star. The quality of the stitching isn't the best, and my phone messed up one of the pockets after being in there for a couple of minuites.

I had to sew the entire crotch back together all the while thinking it was a good thing I did not wear these to yoga class. House pants now.

I might have tolerated the color thing if it hadn't been for the the pockets on the front of the leg. I much prefer my pockets on the side.

These had the potential to be great pants. BUT, the quality of material is so thin just sitting pulled the seams so the fabric separated. After 2 wears, I can only use these as material for crafts, not to wear. I'm very sad about that because I really loved these until the fabric issues & seam issues.  I'm well aware of how to care for these pants, I own many.... Unfortunately these are very cheaply made.",
