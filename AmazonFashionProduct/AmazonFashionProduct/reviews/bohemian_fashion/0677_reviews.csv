The sheer and the sparkles really caught my eye and I had to give it a try. I am bigger chested so smaller covers like this do make me worry. The sizing fits well enough, but a more stretchy material or some extra length on the ties would be nice. Other than that, it looks adorable and does the job.",
Stevie,Fun Festival Top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAME10RO70343/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFP766HZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 6, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Sparkly | Black,,"This sparkly star top is really cute for wearing to festivals or just for adding some fun flair to an outfit. The see-through mesh fabric isn't itchy and has some stretch to it, though won't fully over your bust, if you are a chesty gal. It's more of a layering piece, anyhow - I wouldn't recommend wearing it on its own, unless you're using it as lingerie! It's easy to hand wash and air-dries quickly.",

It fits me perfectly and could easily fit someone much thinner or much larger. The sleeves are a great flowy material and it looks authentic 70s. The material is a bit thinner than expected but it helps it be flowy and comfortable.,

The floral print and sheer material give it an authentic hippie vibe, and the tie front adds a cute touch. The bell sleeves are dramatic and fun, making it perfect for a themed party or casual wear. Highly recommend for anyone looking to channel some retro style!",
Two Trees,"the stars on the sparkly black are white, not silver",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FPW8Q5S04OBJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFP766HZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 7, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Sparkly | Black,,"My heart wanted to get the hippie pink, but I often talk myself into what seems more practical, so I went with the sparkly black - thinking it could be worn with a lot more things (as one reviewer suggested). Unfortunately, I thought that the stars on it were going to be part of the sparkle - that they would be silvery. Instead they are white. There is silver sparkle in the material, but the stars are not part of the sparkle effect. My husband said I look like a wizard... which is not the look I was trying to achieve. I think it will still be cute with the right outfit on the right occasion. It's just not the very versatile dressy shrug I was hoping it would be.  But I do love the style/flowy sleeves. (and I'm still tempted to get the hippie pink..)",

It's lightweight and cute with a pair of bellbottoms. I wear this style daily rather than for costume but it's good for both.",

In addition to wearing it as a top, it looks AMAZING as a little jacket over tops, dresses, tanks, etc.  It layers beautifully with any black, and sparkles in any light.This is an adorable little top. Every woman should have one.  :)",
tabitha,Cute top but not what I expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1W4U872U8FM7V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFP766HZ,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 16, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Floral | Black,,"The material is a semi see through mesh like material. I was not expecting that. The print however, is clear and crisp. Had a good amount of stretch which is helpful as the arms are very snug. Why clothing manufacturers don't realize that if some one orders a larger size, then most likely they have larger arms is beyond me. It is cute though and has the style I was looking for.",
Jonathan P Sexton,Cute but very see through,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RAD7KLI4ILII/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFP766HZ,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 15, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Hippie | Pink,,"This top is perfect for a themed event, however it is super see through.

I got sparkly black and i wanted to wear it with a dance outfit so I think there are many more uses for it than just for Halloween. It's very light, thin, sheer, sparkly and fits nice. The sleeves are very long but i love the way they look. They go down to just where my fingernails start and flare out. No complaints, it's super cute!",

Poverty All-Natural Shopper,Durable Mesh Material Is See-Thru. Ultra Flattering. Versatile. Gorgeous Sleeve Movement.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S4PH4KBTZPGU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFP766HZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 6, 2024",Size: X-SmallColor: Floral | Black,,"For reference, I’m an eccentric Goth that typically wears a teen size S or XS and a 32B bra, I’m 5’4, 110 pounds, with measurements of 32-25-38, and I have the Theatrical Romantic Kibbe body type. I ordered this top in a size XS in the color “Floral | Black.” It looks lovely worn either alone or layered on top of something strappy. The print looks pretty much just like in the product images, though I feel the yellow flowers don’t stand out quite as much. Because of these pretty and moody colors, this top is easy to incorporate into my wardrobe, as it complements goth clothing quite well. On the inside, it’s more of a white color, so you can see that color difference from the outside where this ties in the front, just like in the product images. This is a mesh material, so it’s definitely sheer enough that my nipples can be seen thru it if I go bra-less. It’s a very high quality, durable mesh, though, not being overly elastic and prone to fraying. Still, it has some slight stretch to it, and it feels very soft on the skin. It fits me perfectly and is incredibly flattering on my body type. The upper arms are not loose at all, but they’re not uncomfortably tight either. The bell sleeves are dramatic with tons of slinky movement, and they’re the perfect length to graze my upper knuckles. Overall, I completely love this top and highly recommend it!",
Jessica,Pretty top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8PFMHB2NE957/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFP766HZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 5, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Sparkly | Black,,"I got the black with stars, and it’s so pretty! I got an L, and i’m 5’2 160lbs 36DD and i think i could’ve sized down if i wanted! The details of this top are nice, i love that there’s different shaped stars for a better variety. i also love that it doesn’t shed sparkles everywhere! the material is super thin and seems to be fragile, but that just means you gotta be careful with it! i haven’t run into any issues on my end so far :^) Very happy and i want more colors!",
Raveynn,Adorable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BOIL15OH0IT4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFP766HZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 5, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Sparkly | Black,,"I really love this little top. I was looking for something cute and fun to wear with tank tops to help protect my shoulders and arms a bit more from the sun and I loved the look of this.  The material does have stretch to it and the piece is true to size. The material is verrrrry thin and gauzy, but that's what I expected from this kind of shirt. It's definitely delicate, so you will want to keep that in mind when it comes time to wash. With that being said, the sewing, stiching, and construction is sound. No loose threads. No strange hems. No weird gathering or puckering points. The print is nice and clear and the arms are fun and flowy. The material is not at all scratchy.  I do feel it is priced a little high for what it is so I knocked off a star, but overall, I really am so happy with how it looks and fits.",
