But that liner. *sigh* Ripped both seams of that bad boy within the first 30 minutes of wearing it. Do not allow the liner to be pulled taut before bending over or squatting, the liner fabric is too thin to hold up against the strong thread - I didn't pop the threads, the threads tore out of the fabric. Because I split the sides, I can easily add a triangular panel in the gap and hopefully avoid doing this again. If you're the type to gather all of your skirt to the front before squatting down to sit on your heels, be very careful.  I still recommend the skirt, I'm gonna buy a few more when I'm done writing this. But I wanted to give warning about the liner because the skirt is so thin that the liner is very necessary, it was glaringly obvious (in the rust colored skirt) that I no longer had any side coverage underneath.",3

I got the rust red skirt and the color is a match, the fabric is nice and on par with what I expected based on the pictures, and it barely brushes the length is as described. Great skirt.

I ended up buying, four from Amazon and they are so well-made. The thickness is great. My favorite thing is they have pockets. Any dress with pockets is right up my alley. They do not have strings hanging off of them. The sewing is fantastic. The quality the thickness and they are super comfortable. I have not wore them in public yet , so I don’t know if they are see-through or not but since it is white that is white underlay in it sometimes there is an issue with transparency. They are just so wonderful. I give a 10 out of 10 on these skirts. They go with Boho style to a T-shirt and I’m sure you could do more. You just have to try different things , but I bought them for a Boho style fabulous skirts. They just need to bring the price down because Temu will beat them 100% on price if they end up coming out with more colors and today’s society with companies already raking us across the coals we are all looking for , a way to save money and still enjoy life",2
