Puzzle.buff,Another Unique and Well Made top from Agan Traders!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LWOKP4ZK18AN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08R7Z1YXQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 20, 2015",,Verified Purchase,"I have a closet full of Agan Traders clothes and am running out of things to say in the reviews.  I seem to just be repeating myself.  But that's actually a good thing because all their clothes are great!  This shirt is no exception so I'll say what I've said in many other reviews.  This shirt is unique and bound to start up conversations all around you.  The horizonal design starting just below the waist makes your waist seem smaller than it is and is very flattering.  The stitching on the top is done with care and is strong so, with care during washing, the shirt will last a good long time.  I've never had any stitching come loose on Agan Traders clothing.  The embroidery is done in a purposefully haphazard fashion to give it that unique look but it's done well so there are no loose threads and no fears that the stitching will unravel.  The only ""complaint"" is that the sizes run a little on the large size.  I wear a US Small (size 2-4) and Agan Traders size Small is always a little large on me (I'm 34-26-34) so I have to be careful which tops I purchase.  They can't have V-necks or they drop too low on me because they're a little big on me and they have to have sleeves since I don't fill up the bust line, making the arm holes hang too low on me.  They're long sleeve shirts, however, because of the designs, always look great on me regardless of the fact that they're a little big.  Besides, Agan Traders always lists all the measurements of the shirts so if you go by those measurements, you know what you're getting.  I really think this shirt will look good on any size person because the design is so flattering to the figure.  They seem to be will thought out to flatter the female form, large or small.  I highly recommend the shirt to any who would like to sport a unique fashion.  I highly recommend this shirt.",6
