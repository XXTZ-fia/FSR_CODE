Carol,It is not palazzo pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA0JZJ0USX49H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B2JB1YBC,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Mandala Floral 10,Verified Purchase,I searched for women’s palazzo pants where this was listed. It is a beach skirt not the palazzo pants I wanted. It’s a nice skirt but not the pants I wanted,

Abbey721Road,One size fits all,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA48B3NPUM1S4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B2JB1YBC,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 13, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Mandala Floral 5,Verified Purchase,"Even though it allows you to pick a size for yourself such a small medium and large, when you get it, it is one size fits all. I would be an extra large or large and something like this and it’s a little snug on my hips. The pattern also is slightly askew on the back top waist line because they use a separate fabric or piece to the top of the skirt like a wrap around and do like the flow part down so to me my pattern was slightly off, but I’d wear a shirt that covers it anyways.",
Kendall Parks,I’m so confused,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21JJWGK4HKPI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B2JB1YBC,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 2, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Mandala Floral 1,Verified Purchase,"I got this skirt to match my color analysis/new capsule wardrobe. I loved the soft, dusty colors and the fluttery hem. What arrived instead was a completely different skirt. The colors are completely different, the hem is wavy and the waistband is very wide and unflattering. The only way to wear it would be like a training bra for my belly. I couldnt find a color swatch for the skirt I received so I think the only way this happened was a photo was stolen from someone else and slapped onto this listing. I’m so disappointed.",
Amanda porter,It's okay,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1F956ZUHRWVS3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B2JB1YBC,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 16, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Mandala Floral 18,Verified Purchase,"It's a pretty skirt, the material feels kinda like paper.
