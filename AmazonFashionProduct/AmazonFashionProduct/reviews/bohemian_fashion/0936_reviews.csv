It has enough give and doesn't hug my mid-section which I really appreciate.  The color and pattern of this top are a lot of fun and the transition looks very natural. I can pair this top with a lot of different bottoms, my favorite being leggings and jeans.

I kept it, but I'm not super happy with it because it feels + looks cheap (I just wear it around the house). I really wish these amazon retailers would use their own images, rather than stealing them from other vendors. In the very least they could make a product that reflects the image in terms of color and quality :(",

Those seams make the swearshirt really unique and flattering. It's heavy duty but not bulky. I chose the ombre colored sweatshirt because I liked the color scheme. I've recieved several compliments when wearing it. People actually want to touch it and comment on the hemline and cuffs. I never knew a sweatshirt could become a conversation focus but this one has.
