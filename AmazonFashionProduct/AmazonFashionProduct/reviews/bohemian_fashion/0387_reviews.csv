Texibelle,Don't normally buy clothes on amazon.  Very pleased!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17NN7AREVY1Y9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0831PDM37,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 17, 2024",Size: SmallColor: White,Verified Purchase,"So I normally don't buy clothes on Amazon, or if I do I have very low, low expectations for it.  This is a really cute top and true to how it's described and pictured.  I bought white and green.  The white is white, but not the whitest white I've ever seen.  On its own it looks white, but against something else white it looks VERY slightly cream white.  Not a big deal, but something to point out if you're hoping to wear it against white shorts or something.  The green is a lovely turquoise--more vibrant than it appears on the website.And even though it's an open knit it's pretty modest in my opinion.  The holes are small enough and close together that you're not seeing anything other than skin color through it.  I don't bare my midriff but I am wearing it with a cropped cami bra so I can stay cool today and I don't feel the least bit self conscious.No one is going to think this is expensive, but I think it's on par with something you could find at Express or White House/Black Market.  Really cute, I'm going back for more colors.",

I’m 5’5” and 125lbs; hippy and bosomy. The sweater itself is comfortable, adorable, and made of a really nice thread that is soft to the touch and wears well.  If you like the way it looks, absolutely give it a shot.  It’s terrific and I get tons of compliments. You can dress it up or wear it to the beach or toss on a pair of cutoffs—you’ll look great no matter what.I so, so wish sellers would stop desaturating the colors in their product images.  Most of the time you’re safest sticking with black, brown, or white, because that pretty sage green is going to show up at your front door looking like a shamrock shake on St. Paddy’s Day.  My first purchase was an apricot in size M and it’s extremely bright.  Not a color I’d ever choose to wear, vaguely circus peanut tbh, but in the picture it looks lovely.  Maybe I can dye it?  We’ll see.Next was a khaki in a size S.  My reasoning was that with most loose knit crocheted items like this, over time, the weave loosens up and the garment ends up at least a size bigger, sometimes more. The medium hangs nicely but is a bit boxy, so I thought I’d give the small a try.  Trouble here is the v neck is way high on the small, which I’m not a fan of.  So the color was right, but the size was wrong, though I’m hoping after ten washes it’ll be a bit larger than it is currently.  Not sure the neckline will ever be where I want it, but…Picked it up in a black size medium just to get the deeper neckline and initially it looked right.Wish that the seller could adjust the piece, so that the neckline hits at basically the same spot as the others.Edited to add: Sizing is so irregular and inconsistent you want to scream.  After two washes in cold water and a gentle stretch followed by an air dry draped over a clothes rack, it became plain that my third time’s the charm sweater, the black medium? exactly the same size as the khaki small.  Neckline is also the same.Please get a handle on sizing and it will be the perfect sweater.  Adorable but painful that I can’t get the fit I want.",13

I’m going to have to play with it to set it to the length I like and then get the string secured and tucked away so I don’t have to do it every time.
