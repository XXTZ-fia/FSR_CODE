But I like my kimonos like this to fit big and flowy. This one just didn’t do that unfortunately. The shipping and delivery was great and on time. The black was beautiful and it washed great on delicate. I dried it just a couple minutes to get wrinkles out and hung it up. It didn’t have a bad smell when I received it. It just smelled brand new.
