Not only was it not the right fabric, it had an awful smell and was 'plasticity' feeling even though some poly/spandex blends are soft. There's no way the fabric would breathe well. Absolutely returning. I'm a careful buyer on Amazon and am rarely disappointed with what I receive, but this was an exceptionally bad purchase.",
