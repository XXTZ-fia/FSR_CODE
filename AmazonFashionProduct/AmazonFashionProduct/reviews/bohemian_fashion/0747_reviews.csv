What I didn't like was the fabric and quality of the shirt itself. The photo made me think it would have a little bit of texture similar to a tee shirt. It is actually is like a spandex with the design printed on it. Think spandex leggings with a Jean printed on them. I ordered the print texture yellow shirt. I tried attaching a photo but it keeps disappearing after I load it. So if you order it, just note it has zero texture and is a spandex material with just printing it the inside of the shirt is white so doesn't even match the rest of the colors.",
