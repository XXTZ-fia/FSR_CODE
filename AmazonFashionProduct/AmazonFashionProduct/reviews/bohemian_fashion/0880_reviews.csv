This dress will be returned. The material is nice for Summer. It came very wrinkled so definitely would need a steam.,

I did learn a tip to help your fabric stretch back to original size and that’s hand washing with conditioner to soften the fabric and then stretch gently and hang dry. Point of that tip is you can avoid the mess and labor just wash this type of garment by hand or just gentle wash with cold water in your machine then stretch gently and hang dry. But if you already shrunk your garment try to use conditioner (dollar tree or cheap conditioner will do the trick. Don’t waste your good hair care) The dress its self was well made and is flattering to this short, curvy, big booty mom bod. I’m 5’3” and about 180 lbs and I ordered a large.

It’s still wearable, but it’s a lot longer and wider in the bust area.  I love the flutter sleeves, it steams easily, and it’s long enough on my frame to balance well. The dresses are not see through, and while the garment is not lined, the fabric lays nicely and has enough heft that it does not get staticky or blow about; no need for a slip generally. These have held up well through roughly once a week wears since March. I wash on a cool/gentle cycle and hang dry. No fading so far and minimal shrinkage after the first wash.",18
