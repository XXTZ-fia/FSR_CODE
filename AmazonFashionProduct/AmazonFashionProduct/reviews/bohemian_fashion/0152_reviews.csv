So I deducted two stars.  I’m going to keep it anyways. That’s what washing machines are for. I do think Amazon should have a “rent” option for clothes.",

Kallie Earnhart,"Good quality, low cut",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2H70P4F6GE20R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYYV9MWK,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 14, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Brown,Verified Purchase,"The fabric is very nice and the color matches the picture! However, the dress is very low cut, like plunges below your bra and the sleeves are a little tight. Because of the cut of the neckline, it doesn’t lay perfectly when pinned either. Overall, not bad for the price, though.",

I would even say its sexy if I were sexy but at 70 I’m sad to say those days are mostly over. I do love this dress. Just because I’m old it doesn’t mean I have old lady taste. I was a fashion illustrator in NYC back in the day.,20

The color is a perfect match. It is thick enough to be worn as a dress. It feels so soft and light and flows beautifully as you move. The fit is excellent. I bought it in green too I loved it so much. I wear dior pink lilac blush with this and it is beautiful. You just feel pretty in this dress.,8

As I See it,Medium to Light weight gauze dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Y8DVOAP6I7OD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYYV9MWK,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 16, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Navyblue,Verified Purchase,Medium to Light weight gauze dress … I think the size XLG and fit are perfect on me. I’m 5’7” 180lbs. Even as a beach dress you have to wear with care so it does not rip. It’s not delicate but it is gauze. I did find a long light wt. cotton white slip to wear under it. I wear it to go shopping with ankle strap sandals. I like that it has sleeves to hide my upper arms. Unlike others I think the sleeves are not tight. I bought the brown which looks just like the picture & I wear it with turquoise jewelry. I like that it was Prime and got it in two days. .,5
