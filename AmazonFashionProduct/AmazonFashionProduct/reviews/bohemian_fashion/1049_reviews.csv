I love these pants. This is the second pair that I have purchased, because they are just so comfortable and flattering. They fit really well. The first pair I own has significant thread pulling and seam separations, even though I've only worn them to lounge around in a couple times and never washed them.  They say hand wash, so thats what I plan to do when they need it. This 2nd pair is of the same quality. There are a couple of pulled or loose threads, even right out of the package never worn. I give the quality a 3 star... maybe even 2! I would expect to be able to wear a pair of comfy pants to lounge and do nothing in plenty of times before any damage to the seams, honestly. Especially for 20$. The pants fit really well and look good on. They're cool in the heat and breathable- but I don't notice that I can completely see through them as some people have stated in reviews. I included a picture with my hand inside, and you can make out my silver ring trough the fabric. That being said, if the quality of the fabric and seams can be improved a bit, these would be my absolute favorite to wear, 5/5 pants.",9

And unless you are under 5'3, they are not going to do that cute little fold at the bottom due to length too short and lack of tightness at the ankle. Pokets are not really usable, they are further down than appear online. The material is soft despite it being more linen than cotton. Color and pattern are nice.
