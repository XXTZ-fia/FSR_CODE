Sad to return it. I would suggest these dresses should all come with the adjustable draw tie which can be pulled in to fit comfortably even though they may seem large. I also recommend the same style but in more updated prints. I think a reviewer mentioned the pink/white dress had the adjustable draw tie so I may order it.

Have always loved Indian print fabrics so when I saw these I was excited, plus I love that you can pull the waist in, as this style of dress, on my curvy figure, is much more flattering when I can show my waist. The fabric feels like rayon which means it drapes better than if it was pure cotton and it should last longer than cotton if washed according to the instructions. I liked the dress so much that after trying it on, I promptly ordered another one in a different print. I normally wear a medium but after reading reviews about it shrinking I ordered it in the med and large to see which one would be best while allowing extra room for shrinkage. The med fit perfectly but the large fits fine too but with a bit extra fabric in case of shrinkage, so I went with the large.",12
