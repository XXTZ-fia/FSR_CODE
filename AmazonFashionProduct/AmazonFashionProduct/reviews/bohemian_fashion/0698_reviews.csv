The ruffles on the sleeves just adds a bit of flair to the shirt that we both like.

So if your mid section is a little bigger, you may want to consider sizing up. The shirt is also made for someone with a longer torso than I have. It really is not that flattering on me.

The ruffle 3/4 sleeves and V-neck design add a stylish touch, making this top stand out while still maintaining a classic, versatile look. With a variety of prints available, there’s a style to suit everyone. The loose-fitting tunic style is both flattering and comfortable, offering freedom of movement and an easy, breezy vibe.

The v neck is somewhat conservative, you won't have to cover the neckline when you bend over to avoid giving anyone nearby a free show.  There is elastic on the arms about 1 inch above the elbow, then the ruffle flares out from that. It's a generous amount that you don't really feel it during wear.  I got the sky blue floral, and the photograph accurately represented the color of the shirt i received.  My goal was to get something that's business casual work attire, and it definitely meets that criteria.  This is a solid shirt that I like enough to go back and buy more in other patterns.",2

I found that it ran just a tad bit smaller than I expected but it still fits.  The V neck is just the right depth and doesn’t show off cleavage. What I like the most are the sleeves.  The length and ruffle give it a bit dressier feel and also looks very feminine.  It can be machine washed but the label recommends line drying. If it’s not line dried then you run the risk of the fabric pilling. I would order again but probably one size up because the material is a bit clingy and I’m just more comfortable in oversized clothes.,2
