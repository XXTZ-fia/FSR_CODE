Unfortunately, it’s not suited for women with a larger bust, as the fit is very unflattering. The material quality also feels cheap and not worth the price. It looks much better in pictures than in person, which was disappointing. While it might work for smaller-chested women, it doesn’t offer the needed support.

There's one more brand on here (that sadly doesn't have black), and people said the front was double lined so I was hoping for that. Nope, this one is even more sheer. The skirt is less full feeling and the fabric doesn't feel as nice. It fits a little better in the waist maybe, but my biggest issue is the front area is even smaller than the large I ordered in the other brand (and this one I got XL). Sewing seems a bit shoddy and there's no tag (just the size XL).  You can't tell in the photos but when I take a deep breath you can see my sides of my stomach and ribs which was not the case in the other one because it was wider in front with a fuller skirt. This is super unflattering and I don't feel cute in it like I did in the other. Definitely cover your nips in either one and wear solid panties. I can't imagine this in a light color lol. Also, I'm usually a small or medium but a 36d. Obviously if you have a larger bust or ribcage, this is one is not wide enough in the front.",2
