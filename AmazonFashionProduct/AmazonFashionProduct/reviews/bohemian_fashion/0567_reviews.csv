The fabric is ""silky"" and not cotton-like but that made it perfect for rolling up and packing into my suitcase to travel. When I pulled it out it was not wrinkled at all. The fact that it requires no ironing makes it a winner for me. I am tempted to purchase it in a few more colors. If you normally think you look awkward in these types of ""vests"" try this one!",5
