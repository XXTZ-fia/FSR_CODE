This way, It looks like a loose bubble skirt. When pulled down to my ankles, it looks more like 'harem'  pants. These do work as a tube-top romper on me, as shown, though I doubt I will wear them that way.  Good range of motion in all configurations. Thin fabric, nice for summer or (I suppose) yoga. I will likely wear them on the patio in summer, since they are loose like a skirt but without flying insects getting to sensitive spots!The thin white cloth 'modesty panel' is sort of a miniskirt attached to the inside at the waistband, but it tends to ride up and get bunchy. In this dark color I am not worried about underwear showing through, and I usually wear boxer-briefs with skirts and loose trousers anyway (to avoid the 'chub-rub'), so I will likely cut out the inner panel.
