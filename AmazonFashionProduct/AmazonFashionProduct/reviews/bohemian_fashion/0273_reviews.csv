I listened to Amazon and sized down, and as a result, the stomach area was a little more fitted than I'd prefer... this might work for some people but I don't like fitted clothes around my midsection. I returned the dress and did not repurchase because it was no longer on sale and exchange wasn't an option on the return.",
