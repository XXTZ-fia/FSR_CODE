This 100% fits the bill. I have a large bust, so I did size up one size. I was extremely happy to find that the seam under the bust actually sits under my bust and doesn’t sit in the middle of it, which is what happens to me quite often. When the seam sits where it’s supposed to, it gives my figure more definition, which makes me happy. I may have to buy this in another color too!",5

The texture of the fabric is just a bit rough, but not enough to make me not wear the dress. The elastic in the wrist of the sleeves was something I had to get used to, but now I don't really notice it. The sleeves are almost 2 inches too short on me, but I assume that's because I'm over 6 feet tall. I am also considering making them short sleeves, which I prefer. The underbust elastic is a nice touch, and it keeps the dress from rising up too far on my body. Wearing this make me feel more feminie and beautiful.

Mom of three,"thin, flimsy, see through, bad cut and miserably sewn",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T6A9EGZUG6FX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPLVMS4Z,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Red,,"The ""Dokotoo Women's Boho Maxi Dress Sexy V Neck Puff Long Sleeve Ruffle A-Line Split Swing"" looked so nice in the pictures, but reality set in when it arrived and I tried it on. The material is extremely see through, there is a part of a lining slip sewn in, but it covers just your butt. I cannot understand how the chest is supposed to fit anybody. Directly under your breasts is an elastic band, that a) is uncomfortably tight and b) sits so high that your boobs have no room. This elastic is also sewn on very uneven and unprofessionally. The leg slit, the sleeves and the colorful floral pattern are nice. But I cannot wear this dress and would never spend the $34.88 for it. It is just not worth it.",6
Pampakes,I received SO many compliments!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34ADDJHPCS7H2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPLVMS4Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Sky Blue,,"Everyone I met the day I wore this dress, complimented me on it.  They loved the color and style.  I especially loved the slit as it gave it a more youthful vibe.  It has a nice little lining underneath that is short.  It comes down to where the slit starts which is nice so when I walked, the dress flowed nicely with just the outer chiffon type material.  I wear a size 10 and ordered a medium.  The chest was just a tad tight on me, I had to be careful which bra I chose to wear under.  I should have sized up in this dress as it would have been more comfortable.  Perhaps consider that when ordering this dress.  I have received other tops from this vendor and it seems they run a little smaller overall.",

I am 5’6 and weigh a 182 pound and I ordered a size large (the size I normally wear in dresses) which fit just right. This dress is 100 percent polyester, is lightweight, breathable, and has a quality feel to it . It has a black lining that goes from the top of the dress, down right above my knees, which is nice since the material of the dress is sheer. The dress also has a split on one side of it, that came up to my knees while I was wearing flat shoes. This dress can be hand washed, dry cleaned or machine washed separately in warm water, but Do Not tumble dry this dress per the care instructions. I took this dress right out of the packaging, and did not iron it before taking the posted photos, and it really didn’t need ironing which is a plus. Thumbs up on this flowy, maxi, floral print Dress.",8
Sultana Begum,"Nice chifon maxi dress, fits well!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I1HJ8KZCXBFD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPLVMS4Z,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,,"The print is lovely, and one aspect I appreciate is that the slit is not too big, striking a good balance between style and comfort. Being someone who usually wears a size L-XL, I opted for the XL size, considering my larger bust. The fit around the breast area was great, although there's a bit of unexpected flow after the seam under the breasts. Upon closer inspection, I noticed another seam near the waistline, giving it that A-line description. While I wasn't initially a fan of this additional flow, it does make sense now. To address this, I'm considering pairing the dress with a body suit to help streamline the silhouette and enhance the overall look. Despite this minor detail, I find the dress to be a nice addition to my wardrobe, and with a little styling, it can definitely look fabulous.",5
Amazon Customer,Okay Dress-Not Perfect,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E3X9HYC2XQDO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPLVMS4Z,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Brown,,"This dress is a bit of a hit-and-miss for me. The pattern is really cute and on point. I love the v-neck, which can be very flattering. The elasticized sleeve is nice to give you the option to adjust/roll up the sleeve as needed. But those features are pretty much where the positives end for me.  I would say the sizing is fairly accurate except for the sleeves. They are super tight and uncomfortable. The fabric is super thin, making this dress more of a spring/summer dress. But be aware that the fabric below the lining, which does not come down very far, is basically sheer. The v-neck is very deep as well, questionable as to whether it is work apporporate without a cami. The worst part for me, besides the super tight sleeves, is that the elastic under the cheat area is not swed eventually, so it just looks very awkward to me. The pattern helps hide it a little, but you can feel that it is off and just cheaply done. So I think this could be a decent summer dress, but please note the quality is not very high.",6
