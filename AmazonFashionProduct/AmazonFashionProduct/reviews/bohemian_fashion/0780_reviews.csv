The tribal ethnic print is vibrant and exactly like the photos, which I was so happy about. The print of this sweater is what made me love it most. It’s even more colorful and beautiful in person. It’s made of 85% cotton and 15% polyester, making it soft and stretchy, but still warm and cozy. The fleece lining feels amazing. I love the drop shoulder design—it makes the sweater even more comfortable and casual. The material is thick enough to keep me warm, but not too heavy. Plus, the boho vibe is just so fun and stylish. The package arrived right on time and was carefully packaged—nothing was damaged; no hanging strings, holes, stains, or weird smells. I also appreciate the easy care instructions: machine wash and air dry, which is how I prefer to care for mine. I’ve washed it a few times now, and it still looks as vibrant and new as the day I got it. It’s the perfect balance of style and comfort.

She wears a Kids L or XL and we bought this in a Medium. It is a little loose/oversized but proportionally it is very wearable. We could have gone for a Small but she did not want it super cropped. It is a very sweet shirt. It's lighter weight than a sweater but it is a knit. It reminds me of the knits we used to get in the 70's and 80's but with a softer/silkier hand. Wash on delicate and dry flat or tumble dry on lowest setting. It's perfect for Spring weather when it's cool in the mornings and in the 50's or 60's by afternoon.
