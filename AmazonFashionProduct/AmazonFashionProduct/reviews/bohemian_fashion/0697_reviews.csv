At 5'6"" and 115 lbs., it fits me well.  The pants barely brush the tops of my feet, so the length is fine, but if you are taller or like longer pants, I suggest ordering up a size. I love the overall flowy look with the fitted smocked top, ruffled straps, and side pockets.  The strap width is perfect for covering bra straps (yay for not needing to wear a strapless bra!).

The weight of the fabric is sturdy enough to be called well made.  It is slinky enough to hang nicely, and thick enough to cover bumps and dimples.  The printed green is really attractive in person. The cloth is like a brushed cotton or a heavy tight knit jersey.  It is soft to the touch.Sizing, too.  I am in between a L and an XL.  I ordered L as the brand often runs amply in the size category.  I'm glad I did but probably either works.  I'm bottom heavy and this fits just nicely.  I have a winter vacation planned and I can't wait to wear this.  I may wear on plane with a denim jacket.  Adorable.  LOVE!",
