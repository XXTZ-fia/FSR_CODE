I don't tend to do well with most synthetics unless as a cardigan or outerwear. I saw this was listed as cotton and decided it was worth trying.  FABRIC This jumper is NOT mostly cotton. In fact, I would say this fabric is only about 15% cotton at the most. The bib front and back are made of a twill cotton. It is a heavier weight like a lightweight denim. Painters pants are a similar fabric. The straps look like cotton woven belting web with synthetic patterned overlay. Thats it.  The trim, all skirt pieces, and lining are all synthetic probably polyester. There are no content labels in this jumper, but I am very familiar with fabrics.  STYLE Beside the annoyance that this is not much cotton, I will say the style is cute. It looks really nice over a long dress or a top and skirt. Alone it isn't flattering. It has belt loops on the back so you can belt it which looks nice too.  LINING This lining is soft and not stiff or noisy. It does stick to the skin easily in warm conditions. I find that a skirt or under slip is necessary to avoid that. The dress is very see through so if the lining sticks to you, it won't look nice.  FIT I wear a size 14-16 misses US and this in XL fits well. It is baggy eniugh to allow for belting which also looks cute.  ZIPPER The zipper is invisible style which is annoying when it gets caught on the thin skirt fabric. If you are careful, it works okay.  THE BOTTOM LINE This is a cute jumper skirt, but it is not much cotton.  MY RATING THREE STARS. This is nice, but mostly synthetic. It sticks to the skin in hot humid weather and is warm to wear vs natural. Over a dress or skirt and top, this is better than wearing alone.",15
