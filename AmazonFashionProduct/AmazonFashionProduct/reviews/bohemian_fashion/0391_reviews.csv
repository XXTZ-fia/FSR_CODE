LJG,Cute comfortable top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36HL3A8URLXMB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNDZQ6JX,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: LargeColor: White Pink Floral,,"I like this 3/4 sleeve top! It's great for work and a cute floral fabric. It's soft and fits well. It goes in at the waist and flares a bit by the hips so it's flattering. It was a little tighter in the bust, so if you're large-chested, you might size up unless you like a tighter fit. It was long and looser at the bottom, so it covers any muffin-tops and your behind nicely. Comfortable!",

It’s a nice silky material that has a nice, vibrant pattern and coloring. It’s true to size so order the size that you wear now. It’s long enough it comes down to your hips so it covers any flaws in your tummy area. It washes nicely in the washing machine I hang dry my tops, so I don’t know if it would shrink. It is priced Well for the quality of the product.",

Taylor Hernandez,"Soft Material, Fits True to Size",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39CWQ6EZ53RM2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNDZQ6JX,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: White Pink Floral,,"I ordered the recommended X-Large (but I also measured myself beforehand just to make sure). This shirt fits true to size. It was snug around the mid area though, but that is also user preference. The material is a soft almost silky texture that made it easy to wear. I am someone who is very sensitive to materials in clothes and if there is even a small rough or itchy part, I simply cannot wear it. This shirt did not have that problem. It was light and airy. It did not sit heavy on my shoulders and came down a good length. The only con to this shirt is that it is slightly see through and you need to either wear a nude/white bra or an undershirt. The final thing, which is 100% my personal preference, is that this reminds me of something my mother used to wear. It was a similar style to the majority of her wardrobe, and I personally don't feel that I am ready for this style. It will sit in my closet until I am ready to pull it out and give it another try. That being said, I love the design. The floral print is beautiful, and the pleated top makes it lay nicely over the front. I will be wearing this later down the line or when I find an event that this will be appropriate for. I highly recommend this shirt and think it will be a perfectly added piece to anyone's collection.",

TitaniumPrincess,"Soft fabric, well made, unexpectedly bright!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HZ5AVSJ1CNHA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNDZQ6JX,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 19, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Bohemia Floral,,"The fabric used is wonderful! Silky soft without being shiny, it has a wonderful hand feel & great drape. It even manages to skim lumps & bumps instead of cling. The cut is equally nice, and is flattering even on my chubby hourglass from the front, pregnant from the side build. Will be great paired with jeans! My only complaint is that while the colors of the bohemia floral appear soft & somewhat muted in listing photos, in person they are vivid, bright, and VERY orange! I'll try to add pics in the next few days. If the bohemia floral colors were as soft/muted as they appear in listing photos, this would be an easy 5 star top. Had to ding a star for the unexpectedly bright & vivid orange color that's really in your face. Love everything about this top EXCEPT for the color discrepancy, and would buy another color without hesitation.",

It hangs really nicely and it has a small amount of stretch. I ordered down one size as it’s loose fitting, it fits really nicely in the body, but the arms are almost too tight, which is no fault of the shirt sizing is because I ordered down. if you like your shirt, not so loose fitting, order down one size, just be aware if you have bigger arms that the arms may be tight. Overall, it’s a really nice top that is pretty and made well.",

The pattern on the fabric was not loud and was stylish with the bodice's stitched pleats. The neckline was cut well and not too deeply.  No buttons to worry with.  The fit was true and the construction of the garment was excellent. no loose strings, unsewn seams, or puckers.  It was very comfortable as I ended up wearing it 8 hours.  I definitely would buy this blouse again.  The only issue I have, which is very minor, is the care tag did not state how this was to be dried....line, low heat, block, etc.  I have to assume hang to dry from the washer.  Five stars.",3
