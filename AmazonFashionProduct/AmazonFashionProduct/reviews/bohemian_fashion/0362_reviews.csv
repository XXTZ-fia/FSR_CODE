They were also shipped and delivered in about a week.  This item must come from a different supplier for Beauty Batik. It was way too small though tagged the same size as the others and of the same material, and it took over a month to be shipped.  The size was at least one if not 2 sizes smaller. It would be a 4 star if not for the sizing.  A company needs to keep its sizing consistent within the product. This is going back, and I'm hesitating on trying to buy more.

So I ordered a second one (I was perfectly fine with waiting any length of time this time) and got 2X. Well, that one came and the sleeves were tight! I was like, how did it go from too roomy to tight? But then I looked at the tag…. XL and 2X are the same, so I assume 3X and 4X are the same, so it’s not that specific in sizes, just fyi. There is no stretch to the fabric, so I rather have it loose. But by golly it’s pretty.",3

It is gorgeous to look at, and the rayon is as I expected, the right weight, and good construction, but it is about 3 inches shorter than past tunics I've bought. For a shorter person, this may not matter, ( I am 5'11"") but when a tunic ends at the top of your legs instead of top of thighs, like past tunics, I wonder why.
