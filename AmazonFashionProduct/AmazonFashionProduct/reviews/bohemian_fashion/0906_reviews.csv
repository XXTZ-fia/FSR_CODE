The material is very stretchy.  I purposely ordeded the dress up a couple of sizes so not to  stretch and show all your curves and have a high hem.  The dress skims over the body and fits more like the picture  with no tIght fitting areas. and the person loves the dress.,

It reaches me about an 1 Inch above the knee and had space at the waist. It fits my 36D chest to a Tee! So I’m glad I went with the xl I didn’t want it stuck on. My main disappointment was that it wasn’t the stiff daishiki material I was expecting but fully spandex so if you don’t want a tight fit go a size or two bigger.,
