I received the item in a very timely fashion. The problem is there was oil, yes oil in the outer package. When I reached in to remove the inner package with the shirt my hand got wet; it wasn't water, it was oil. The good thing was that the seal on the inner packaging kept the oil from getting to the shirt. With the help of another person opening the inner package, I was able to remove the shirt without getting oil on it. I'm sorry but I don't see any way this could have been an accident. There was a lot of oil. I haven't washed it yet so I don't know how the color or fabric will hold up. If I don't forget I will post another review.",2
