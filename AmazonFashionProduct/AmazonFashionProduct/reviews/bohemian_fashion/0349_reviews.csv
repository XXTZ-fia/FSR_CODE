Grams,Bought three,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5JEGVAMBUS07/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNT1XF5L,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: All BlackSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"They tops were on sale, sleeveless so I can wear them under a cardigan without roasting in a Christmas group of people. I like eyelet, they are comfortable, the length is perfect covering what I wanted covered. I washed them and put them in a hot dryer and they didn’t shrink. I think they are nice and will wear them in the summer. Of course I do t like skin peeping through at my age, so you can put another skinny strap shirt under it if you want. Versatile style to wear with shorts, skirt or slacks/jeans.",

Very breathable.  Washed in cold, dried low heat.  Zero shrinkage.  Casual for sure, but the material has a stylish, understated pattern which takes it well above the run of the mill.",
Satisfied Customer,Very soft!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWZTV7NB30L7I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNT1XF5L,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Color: PurpleSize: Large,Verified Purchase,Perfect fit and the color is gorgeous. It is extremely soft. Can’t wait for summer! If I were you I would buy your usual size. Tank top is a little big for the size I usually wear.,

Great for warm weather and washed beautifully. She’s requested more like it. Fit is true to size.",
MissyN,Too long for me,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RO4ZWAH0ARZYB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNT1XF5L,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 14, 2024",Color: Tender Floral BlueSize: XX-Large,,Material is nice but not a huge fan of the pattern.  It’s also a little too long for me. (I’m 5’4”). Outside of being long (for me) the fit is pretty true to size.  I’ll be wearing it under a cardigan so it should be fine.,
Michelle D,Pink Tank Top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34FDAJO8B5KEP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNT1XF5L,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: Hot PinkSize: XX-Large,,The tank top comes with a nice eyelet pattern.  The pink is a very pretty color.  The material is soft.  I sized up and it is quite loose.  This is a tank top that I probably did not have to size up.  Overall this is a very nice tank top.,
Anna Horn,Nice top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1L0W6JCL9B229/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNT1XF5L,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2024",Color: Tender Floral BohoSize: X-Large,,"Nice, simple top for summer wear or layering. The material is good quality, similar to t-shirt material, but a little more silky. The top has a nice amount to stretch to it, but the design is not distorted when I manipulate the fabric. The top is long like a tunic with shorter sides. The slope is not cut to my body type, but with the tunic length, it accomodates my curves and looks nice with a cardigan. Overall, nice top.",
JRR,Cute and comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FVKDIGJWV7VF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNT1XF5L,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 4, 2024",Color: RedSize: XX-Large,,"Be careful when choosing your color. I picked red, which I thought looked almost maroon in the picture. In real life, it appears more of a bright red. The color is still really nice, but had I known I probably would have gone for black, or white. Even so, it is still a cute top. The material is lightweight, silky soft, and slightly stretchy. Super comfortable. The eyelet holes are large enough that you should plan on wearing a cami underneath. The sizing does seem slightly large especially if you wear it untucked. I tried it tucked in also, which made it a little cleaner of a look and in turn made the sizing seem more appropriate. So maybe consider how you want to wear it and determine if you want to size down.",
Kindle Customer,"Fits Great, Good Price",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UHZVDQVFUX5L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNT1XF5L,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 13, 2024",Color: Tender Floral YellowSize: Medium,,"This is a perfect fit.  No gap under arms and I like the scooped hemline.  It is a 'slicker' feel than I like, I prefer a more 'cotton-ey' softness, but still soft and comfortable.  I always think the tops look better on the models than on me, but I do like the flowered design.",
MaK,More orange than expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2E7OT60W18EWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNT1XF5L,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 13, 2024",Color: Tender Floral StripedSize: Medium,,"This tank is comfortable and fits well. I got the black and orange striped pattern, as I thought the orange would be maybe more of a burnt or browner orange, based on the product photo. In person, it’s a pretty standard orange.",
Jen & Chris,Soft and flowy…also very sheer!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IPXL88I6LVY3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNT1XF5L,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 30, 2024",Color: CoralSize: XX-Large,,"This is such a pretty top and is so comfy, too. It’s soft, flowy, and very comfy. I would recommend wearing a camisole or something underneath, as it is a little bit sheer. There’s no inner lining and unless you’re wearing a nude bra, people are going to see what’s underneath…lol! I really wish it had some kind of thin lining just to make it less sheer, but I still like it a lot.",
SB,Size Down,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32KO4DE6D4NMB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNT1XF5L,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 2, 2024",Color: RedSize: Small,,"I am 5'1"", bust 39 inches, waist 33 inches.  I normally wear medium, but got a small, and it fit perfectly.  At my height, the length went to below my hips.  I got the red color, which is a beautiful crimson.  What I like best about this is that it has the cut-out look, but it is NOT SEE-THROUGH.  It will not show your bra.  The fabric is not thin and is well-crafted.  Recommend!",
mara Lee,This is a keeper!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R223TCE2NJ9TSJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNT1XF5L,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 29, 2024",Color: Tender Floral BlueSize: Small,,This shirt is so cute.

This is not. I typically order a 2x when I want a looser fit and this was perfect. Had a nice hang and fit my arms without showing bra or ribs. It's a nice vibrant red. Overall I am very happy with this tank!,
Polly,Such a cute shirt!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OYC1DZOXCQEG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNT1XF5L,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 6, 2024",Color: Tender Floral BohoSize: Medium,,"I don’t want to sound cheesy, but this shirt fits me like it was made for me. I love the fabric, the length, the size of the arm openings, the rounded neck, etc! The pattern on the fabric design is perfectly placed also, symmetrical may be the word I’m looking for. I wish we had warmer weather now so I could wear it, but I guess I will have to wait. All in all, you can’t go wrong with this shirt and the very reasonable price!",
Lisa Ahlstedt,Easy to wear!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P2KK2UNPGNC4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNT1XF5L,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 5, 2024",Color: Tender Floral BlueSize: Large,,"I love the material this shirt is made of! It's cool and somewhat ""slick"" feeling, so it doesn't wrinkle. This is a major plus if you're planning to pack it for your next trip and don't need to think about ironing. The fit is loose and flowing without being too big. The hem is not straight across, so it is a comfortable fit at the waistline. The material didn't gap under the arms, which can sometimes be a problem. I love the design with the various colors which will go well with many outfits. Love it!",

I got the white top and with a white bra, you can barely tell that the top is a bit see through due to the cute eyelets.  I adore the flow of the top and the fit is perfect.  The arm holes are small enough and will not show off your bra.  This top is great and I can wear it for practically any type of event, from casual to dressing up.  I am looking forward to wearing this top during our next tropical vacation.",

Matt C,Not the shade you'll get,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP5BQ0D9P29NK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNT1XF5L,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 1, 2024",Color: CoralSize: Small,,I ordered this based on the color of the shirt in the main photos but when you scroll down much further is where you will see what the color actually is...much more of a brighter pink than what was pictured above. I wish it was true to the first photos. I guess the fit is just okay. Definitely need to wear something under it because the eyelets go right through the shirt so you have little holes all through it.,
