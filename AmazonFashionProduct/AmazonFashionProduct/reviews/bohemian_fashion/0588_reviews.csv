Alison0997,Love!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZS65MO0PK18Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49NW661,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: WhiteSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this dress for my post wedding farewell brunch and I love it. It's lightweight, fits really well, the bust is nice and stretchy and I love the detailing at the bottom. Our honeymoon is in Puerto Vallarta and it's sort of reminds me of a Mexican type style of dress. It did have quite a few wrinkles but a quick steam takes them all out. I tried on a few dresses that were very similar that were see through but this one isn't see through at all. However, it does have a slip that gets a little staticky, so be mindful of that. Overall this is a great dress and I can't wait to wear this to our brunch as well as while we're in Mexico on our honeymoon!",

The quality isn’t that great for the money. Also the picture is deceiving. I’m 5’8 and this dress isn’t long enough. It is 1 foot below my knee cap. It is very wrinkly and yes you need to iron it. If you sit and get up will create wrinkles. So not practical. Not that great material either. Therefore I’m retuning it. I got a small it fit true to size.,
