It’s spaghetti strapped and then a second strap tied around your neck giving a double strap look.  Light fabric that flows.  Because it fits more loosely, if you want a snugger fit, I would size down 1 size.",
Karen Froschauer,BEAUTIFUL,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2STCPNXW90TG4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJQQBG3F,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Color: Colorful Flora3Size: Medium,,"THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL WELL MADE DRESS WITH NO UNEVEN SEAMS AND NO LOOSE OR HANGING THREADS. THIS IS A NICE QUALITY MATERIAL WHICH ISN'T REAL THIN. IT IS A NICE WEIGHT THAT WILL KEEP YOU COOL AND COMFORTABLE IN THOSE HOT SUMMER MONTHS. THIS ALSO RUNS TRUE TO SIZE ~ FOR REFERENCE I AM 5' TALL WEIGHT ABOUT 120 POUNDS AND WEAR A 38D/C BRA AND BOUGHT THIS IN A MEDIUM AND THIS FIT NICELY. EVEN THOUGH I AM ON THE SHORTER SIDE THIS DID HANG  LOW ON ME HOWEVER IT DIDN'T HANG TO LOW ~ I WASN'T TRIPPING ON IT NOR WAS IT DRAGGING ON THE FLOOR SO THAT WAS A PLUS. I WASHED THIS ON COLD AND DRIED ON MEDIUM AND THIS DIDN'T SHRINK,FADE OR PILL. I WILL SAY THAT I WAS VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT THIS HAD ADJUSTABLE STRAPS SO THAT I COULD MAKE THIS FIT A OT BETTER SO THAT THE DRESS WASN'T SITTING TO LOW AT THE CHEST. I ALSO LOVE THE COLORS AS THEY ARE SO VIBRANT AND FUN. I JUST CANNOT WAIT FOR WINTER TO GO AWAY SO THAT I CAN START WEARING THIS. I AM SO HAPPY WITH THIS AND I THINK THE PRICE OF $29.99 ( THE PRICE AT MY TIME OF PURCHASE) IS FAIR AS YOU ARE GETTING A GREAT QUALITY ITEM.",

The extra string for the neck helps keep the shoulder straps in place, and the dress has pockets. I am 5.2 feet tall, and the dress is maxi length for me. The dress is comfortable, and the fabric quality is only noticeable up close. The print camouflages any imperfections in the body of the fabric.",

There are pockets that can hold small items as well-which is a plus!  The material is a lighter weight but not transparent and can be worn as a swimsuit cover-up, strolling on the beach, or out to dinner. It will pack well also. (Value of $34.99 at time of review)",

However, the size tag is in front so it rubs between the girls and i would just flip it around but then you lose the design.  Hopefully they only screwed up mine lol",
GeekyGirlie74,Beautiful cut and flow!

The fit, fabric, and pockets are all awesome! The fabric is so nice and is the lint resistant type that I love to find. But let’s talk about the double straps! That’s the magic of the dress! You can adjust the fit and flow by adjusting the tied straps or change the look by tying them differently depending on the mood - look on Pinterest for some fun options or tutorials for creative ways to tie halter tops & dresses! Very versatile!",

The vibrant green floral pattern is eye-catching. The strappy details and split design give the dress a boho vibe that’s both trendy and comfortable. She loves the pockets too. Plus, the dress is easy to dress up with sandals for a beach look or pair with sneakers for more active days. She’s been wearing it almost every day since it arrived. This dress combines style, comfort, and practicality beautifully. It’s a fantastic choice for anyone looking to add a vibrant and versatile dress to their collection.",
Jesse D Harris,"Cute, but material is cheaper",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MMPPJPJIL1YK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJQQBG3F,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 31, 2024",Color: Green FloraSize: X-Large,,"I am a size 16 and got the XL which fits perfectly. the material is thin and has  a little bit of stretch to it. It's flattering on and I think it's a cute dress. That said, this is not a quality garment. I expect to maybe get a few wears out of it. It's similar to what you might expect to get at Ross and I don't think the price tag is worth it.",2

Their size chart is true to size, as the size I ordered fits me perfectly.  The overall design is very flattering & the fabric is very light & feels nice against my skin.  Not sure what I'm supposed to do with the two loose strings by the straps, I guess either tie them together in the back or just let them hang down freely?  I also like the design I ordered, Blue Flora, even though the background color isn't blue, it's black, which I like even better than it being blue.",

The side slits are not so high as to be immodest—just above the knee, but they do make movement easier. There are several patterns available, and different colors. It washes easily and no ironing needed. The shoulder tie straps can be adjusted, and the V neck is not too low. The material is lightweight but thick enough that it is not see-through. These shoes are side pockets are a really nice addition! Can’t wait for warm weather so I can show off this great dress!",5

The V-neck and strappy design are flattering, and the split detail adds a touch of elegance and ease of movement. The XX-Large size fits true to size, with a comfortable and flowy fit that enhances its casual, breezy appeal.  The fabric is lightweight yet not see-through, making it ideal for hot summer days. It feels soft against the skin and has a lovely drape without clinging. The quality of the stitching and finish is impressive for the price.  The addition of pockets is a game-changer! They are deep enough to hold essentials like a phone or keys without ruining the dress's silhouette.  This maxi dress is incredibly versatile. I wore it to a beach vacation, and it was both stylish and practical. It transitions seamlessly from casual daywear to a relaxed evening outfit by simply adding a statement necklace or a shawl.  It’s easy to care for—machine washable and holds its color and shape well after washing.",3

It’s polyester with spandex, so it flows well and also clings to curves just enough. It will work as a sundress or a beach coverup. Has adjustable shoulder straps and a tie for behind the neck, which is nice as it keeps the shoulders in place. The leaf pattern is beautiful; I especially like the ‘shadow’ leaves behind the brightly colored ones, as it makes the dress more opaque. Scallop bottom hem with a side slit makes it easier to walk around. Fits well and very comfortable.",2
