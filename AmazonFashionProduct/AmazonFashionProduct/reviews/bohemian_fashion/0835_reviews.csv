TheCove Fashionista Earns Commissions,Not the best quality made !,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2J8VHAZJA2XL8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DSJJXJDK,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Color: RedSize: Large,,I gave it a 3⭐️ because I felt the quality didn’t match the price of 29.95 . Tho I purchased it on sale I felt that was more like it.  Not well made BUT I love the look! It’s vibrant and super chic trendy! Don’t really know what to do with the ties but over all I like how it fits . I’m in between  M & L so I went with Large. Glad I did cause there’s not any stretch but it fits loosely. I’ll wear it this summer and fall with shorts or jeans and a cardigan with it every now and again !  The winter months will brighten up those dreary days I’ll wear a cardigan as well. It’s so vibrant and cheerful! Overall it’s a thin satin kinda material with a thin lining so you can’t see through and it comes down over my butt so the length is good . I can tuck it or leave it hang . I love it though ! I’ll wear it often !,
Val,Nice flowing printed blouse,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYSGZ87HBLO22/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DSJJXJDK,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 9, 2024",Color: WhiteSize: X-Large,,"This is a nice “Boho” style floral printed blouse/shirt/top. It can be worn with dress pants or nice skirt for a dressier look, or with jeans, shorts, etc., for a more casual look. It washes and dries easily, especially if you don't mind a few small wrinkles. The style of this top does lend to the more casual side, so a few wrinkles look fine. The elastic at the wrists is nice to hold the sleeve in place, but not too tight. I wasn't sure what to do with the drawstrings, so I just tied them together in a knot about 6 inches from the end and they looked fine. I gave this a 4 star rating as the print does not go all the way through the fabric, so if the fabric flips over, you see the blank reverse side. Nice top for the price.",
L.

It's rather cute but definitely disappointing.  It is not a flattering cut, and the thinness is a tad too cold and sheer. Seems true to size.  I would not reorder but I don't entirely dislike it.  It will be pleasant for a few wears.",

Love the pattern. Fabric feels quality and has no stitching issues. Fabric has no stretch and is stiff, similar to a men's button up shirt. I washed and laid flat to dry, and the shirt was still wrinkled (see pics), so be prepared to steam it before wearing it out. Love this top, I know I'll get a lot of use out of it.",

Unfortunately I can’t recommend this item.",

It is comfortable to wear but the fabric has this cheap acetate-like feel to it. If you're sensitive to the way fabrics feel on your skin than I would skip this one.

Julie,Best thing about this is the photo.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIR792VT9XH5X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DSJJXJDK,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 28, 2024",Color: RedSize: X-Large,,"I didn't like this blouse from the moment I took it out of the bag.  This polyester fabric is satin-like, doesn't breath, and doesn't hang softly or well at all.  It feels awful on the skin and I couldn't get it off fast enough.  It also comes with heavy duty packaging wrinkles and nothing changed when machine washed in cold water and tumble dried for 10 minutes, then hung to finish drying.  It looks and feels no different afterwards.  The garment care tag says don't iron, so I guess you're supposed to wear it looking like it just came out of the squished package.  There are so many things is the description of this blouse that are not true or misleading at the best.  As an example, not one thing in the following sorta-sentence is true:  ""Soft, lightweight, breathable fabric is allowing you to experience freedom of movement with utmost comfort""  Chiffon?  Not even close.  And I'd bet you that the fabric in the photo is not the same fabric - the photo looks chiffon like, making it a totally different blouse.  And the wide ranging descriptions are so laughable.  ""Whether for business meetings or casual gatherings, this boho tops for women epitomizes your multifaceted charm.""  Whatever charm I might have had before I opened the package has temporarily  left me.",4
Jen,Color a bit different from the picture,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SMPMK8UUQZ9O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DSJJXJDK,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 28, 2024",Color: RedSize: Medium,,"It's a decent shirt but I bought it because it looked red with some slight orange in it but it really is just a bright orange which isn't as nice as it appears.  It's also dressier than i thought.  I washed and dried and it came out wrinkle free so that's a bonus.  I wore it and it was mostly comfortable, it fit according to size, just a little too bright for me and that's my main issue with it.",
Jane Rosenthal,"Cute top, but more orange than red",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11GMJ7IYCTRNO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DSJJXJDK,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 27, 2024",Color: RedSize: XX-Large,,"I like this top. The fabric seemed rather stiff at first, but really softened up after the first wash.  There was no shrinkage in the wash and the fit is ok but there is no stretch in the fabric at all. The color is more orange than it appears in the photo, which I admit is not flattering on me (red is always a tough color for me, I don’t look good in anything yellow or with yellow undertones, as is the case with the red of this top). Still, it is a nice quality top.",
CWP,Not Very Comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29RK59CBJQPNZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DSJJXJDK,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 23, 2024",Color: RedSize: Medium,,This women’s Boho blouse isn’t overly comfortable and is made of what I would call canvas (I know that’s not what is listed) but there is no stretch what so ever.  I’m hoping it will soften up when washing.  The print is pretty but not quite what I was hoping and overall the price for this blouse is overpriced (in my opinion). Overall three stars from me.,

Nice ruffle sleeve detail.",
