Jeannie Weston,"Beautiful, well made and playful",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Q3PHZIJB1DS9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B3J6XVVJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Floral,Verified Purchase,"I am 5’8” and weigh 145 lbs and though I usually wear a medium I decided to buy a size large because I wanted a flowy look. I’m really impressed with the quality of fabric which is both soft with a slight sheen and is slightly thicker than I expected so no worries that it is see through. It is also very comfortable with no binding.  The contrast of the delicate floral pattern on the bottom half of the skirt against the black fabric is striking making the pattern really stand out. Also the stitching at the waist hits me exactly in the right spot and is flattering to my waistline.  I’m so happy with the overall look which is feminine, fashionable and fun and has a lot of versatility from dressed up with accessories or dressed down for every day wear.  I’m so happy with my purchase and highly recommend this dress!",

The print is nice, but much cruder than in the photo. I’d never have bought this if I’d seen it in person first.
