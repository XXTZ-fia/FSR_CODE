The waistband gave me a muffin top, even pulled up further on my waist. But pulled up like that gave me weird thigh creases and the dreaded camel you-know-what.  The fabric is *as listed*, 100% polyester. Not sure why people would even imagine they're cotton, when the material is very clearly listed as polyester. It is quite thin. I got the gray elephant, and there was definitely some see-through, because the pants were so tight on my booty. The fabric is the typical slick, shiny texture of polyester.  The pants were also quite long for my frame. Possibly suitable with heels, but I don't wear heels, so I would most likely have had them hemmed.  On a positive note, the flow was lovely and the pants wrapped around enough to not fly open and flash your unders in a light breeze.  I'll be returning. Hope this review helps out similarly curvy gals like me!",3
