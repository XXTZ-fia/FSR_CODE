PetersonCo.,AELSON Women’s Boho V Neck Print Romper: A Mixed Experience,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AIA61J54NAEK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CSMPRFS,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 13, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"As an avid online shopper, I recently decided to try out the AELSON Women’s Boho V Neck Print Romper Playsuit with Long Flare Sleeves, intrigued by its promise of bohemian chic style. While the pictures online portrayed a cute and stylish romper, my experience upon receiving it was a bit mixed.  Let’s start with the positives. The color of the romper is not so boho-inspired but it’s black and that’s my favorite color choice for clothing. The long flare sleeves though contribute to the bohemian vibe, giving it a trendy and fashion-forward feel.  However, there were a few aspects of the romper that didn’t quite meet my expectations. Firstly, the fit was not as flattering as I had hoped. The V-neckline was a bit deeper than expected, and the overall silhouette felt a bit boxy on my frame. Additionally, the material of the romper was thinner than anticipated, which made it feel a bit flimsy and less substantial than I would have liked.  Despite these drawbacks, I must acknowledge that the romper could still have its appeal for others who have different preferences or body types. It could be styled in various ways to suit different occasions and personal styles.  In conclusion, while the AELSON Women’s Boho V Neck Print Romper may not have been my favorite purchase, it still has its merits. Its bohemian print and flare sleeves offer a trendy and playful look, though the fit and material fell short of my expectations. Ultimately, it’s a reminder that sometimes, what looks good in pictures may not always translate the same in person.",3

I also like the tie-up front because you can tie into a bow in the front orrr wrap it around and tie in the back for a little more coverage and support.  For the tall girlies, you may wanna size up. I’m 5’8, 160 lbs, 34D and I got a large….while it fit everywhere else there wasn’t much length in the shorts.
