I don’t know if it is just because of my body shape (I do have hips) or what, but they were driving me crazy.  I decided to try the “crop” version and am much happier with the fit! I don’t find I need to yank anything back down.  The crop fits me more like a sports bra, really.  There isn’t a whole lot of extra length below the bust, but that’s ok.  I mainly wear these in my own home gym, as an under shirt with tanks or see-through tops, or to sleep in.  I probably wouldn’t not consider them as a stand alone tank, even with the style seen today of wearing high cropped tanks or longer length sport bras alone.  They are very stretchy and the ribbed fabric isn’t scratchy or itchy at all.  There is no padding at all, which how I prefer it. I usually wear my Cakes nip covers if I need some sort of “padding”. I can wear these tanks all day without irritation. I am a 36C in a bra and ordered the M/L size.  For reference I am usually considered a long torso gal at 5’8 1/2” tall and am 150 lbs.",
