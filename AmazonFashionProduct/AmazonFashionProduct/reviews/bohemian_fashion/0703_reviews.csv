Slides right over my head and drapes nicely. Very flattering as it hides that tummy. I would have worn this shirt in my 20s but am happy to wear it in my 60s. The waffle weave fabric of the main shirt is quite light weight. Honestly, that part looks boring and I wouldn't necessarily have bought the shirt if it were all like that.
