They were also my go to pants in summer when I didn't wanna wear shorts but it was super hot out because they're a very soft, thin material.  They keep you cool, kinda reminds me of those super soft tshirts AE sells.Anyway, as you can see, my height/weight shouldn't fit in these according to the size chart but because they're so soft n stretchy, an XL fits me perfect.  The only downside is the more you wash them the thinner they get and it starts after just a couple washes so I'm back buying more even though I really only wore them last summer and tried my best to wash them as little as possible.",2
