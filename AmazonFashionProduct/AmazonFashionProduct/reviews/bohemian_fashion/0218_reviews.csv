It is simply gorgeous! It is very nicely constructed, beautifully, and fully lined. Both layers are made of good quality fabric that no only feels like silk on my skin, it gives the dress a very nice flow. I am a seamstress, who loves, appreciates, and can identify great garmet construction. This one came, without one hanging thread or one missed stitch. Straps are adjustable! This is also a timeless style that can be worn with pearls or no jewelry at all. It can be matched with a cute jacket, if you like in fall and spring. It has no pockets. I am looking forward to wearing this gorgeous dress casually or dressy, to luncheons, a tea party, a wedding, or just because..., with a beautiful dressy shoe (sandal or heel) and even a cute flip flop can work. I love it! I would not at all suggest this dress for beach wear. It's too nice for beach sand or reclining on the beach. When I wear it, I'll come back and post a photo.😃👍🏽👍🏻👍🏿👍 Note: I'll definitely remember this brand/manufacturer for future purchases.👌👌🏾👌🏼👌🏽  Suggestion: Buy according to your breast measurement, not necessarily your normal dress size. If your fabric and construction is as nice as mine, you'll be pleased with the flow.",3

Created a little video so you can see how it moves and flows. I ordered the sky blue. I’m tall 5‘9“, 185 pounds. soon to be 61 years old. I ordered this for a “wear blue before I do” outdoor bridal shower picnic coming up next month. The weather is hot and humid here all the time so I will be wearing it during a hot season in September. I think the color is beautiful and it’s a pretty flowy dress. I put the dress in a garment bag and washed it on cold water/gentle cycle and air dried it. It dried well without any wrinkles. I deal with food intolerance, stomach swelling, so the extra large is a perfect size for me. I find that while wearing the dress, it feels light and Not heavy. I only wore it outside for a little bit to record the video, our temperatures have been in the high 90°, and I didn’t find the dress to be hot. I’m going to order more colors.",6

I am 5'4"" and 220. A true pear, smaller on top, fuller on the bottom. Not super tall either- so short waisted. I got the XL and it is a bit big on the top and where the horizontal seam hits at the hips is touching. If I get the XXL, then I have to have this taken in on the top and it might be too long. It's an ok length right now. I do feel like I need to have this altered at the moment. But I'm trending down in weight so I may just hold onto it and maybe next summer it will be a full flow-er, maybe a jean jacket on top, etc.  Note that the pockets hit high up on me, so they are creating a bit of fullness at my smallest section.  So not great for me- but if you are plus size and not a real pear, this maybe just right. Its lined and great look. I know everyone likes the material- I am not a super fan of synthetics, but the when the dress is so pretty- like this one- I accept it. Hope this helps!",11
