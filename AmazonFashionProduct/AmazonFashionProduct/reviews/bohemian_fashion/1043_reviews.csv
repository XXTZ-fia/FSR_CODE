The material is very cheap and thin, like other reviews state. There is no slip; however, I don’t feel that it is see through at all. The color is just like the picture and I think with a good iron, this dress would wear nicely.  For reference, I am 5’9”, about 211 lbs, and 30 weeks pregnant. The tiers of the dress are not restricting, so I feel this dress would fit for several more weeks, if not the remainder of my pregnancy.",

I ordered the XL in the yellow plaid. The square neck was too wide, the smocked top came down too low on my torso, the elastic on the sleeves was tight, and the skirt's decorative seam hit mid-hip (my widest point). I don't have sensory issues and even I found the material to be scratchy and uncomfortable. You could see through it too much to be wearable in my opinion. I think this is an adorable dress for longer, less curvy body types who are comfortable wearing slips and tolerating scratchy fabric.",

I took off one star because the material is on the thinner side and I think the tie in the back could have been left off. I don’t think it’s worth the full price but I got it for $17 on promo!
