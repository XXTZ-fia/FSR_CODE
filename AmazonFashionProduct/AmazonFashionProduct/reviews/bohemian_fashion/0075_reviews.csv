Now that the shirt is finally here I opened it up and it smells horrible.  Despite that I thought I would try it on because maybe washing will fix the smell. Washing will not fix the issues with the shirt. I bought a size large ( my normal size is l) which is actually a size smaller than what their size chart states I should have bought. I could have sized to a Medium. But a L is short so if you raise your arms you're going to see your stomach but also the way it sewn makes the underarm too big so the shirt doesn't sit right.
