If someone else has that intention, the item runs large.  I normally wear a medium and ordered a small, which fits perfectly.  It would be too short, but I always wear bicycle shorts under my summer dresses.  I added a small stretchy belt to add a little form.",

Overall I like the light fabric, although it took a very long time to dry in Mexico. May have been the humidity...maybe. The styling could be improved with maybe a yoke or something at the top to help make it more interesting.",

BackyardGardener,Beautiful Summer Dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12HSQXKHN8DWJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNK3C8KK,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 28, 2025",Color: 01 ApricotSize: Large,,"This little dress is made from a thin, lightweight, viscose fabric.  It's very breathable, soft and silky.  I am 5'5"", weigh about 160 pounds and wear a 38DD.  A size large had plenty of room to allow for ease of movement for me.  The sleeves extend just beyond my elbows, so I can easily do chores or wash dishes without having to push them out of the way. The elastic shirring on the topside of the sleeves add interest to the design. I chose the 01 Apricot and I love the print and colors.The only concern I have is that I feel that the ties could be damaged easily. I've had tops with these types of ties before, and they eventually became unraveled and had to be clipped off.  I am planning on handwashing this dress (it can be machine washed) and hanging to dry (recommended) to try and keep the ties in good condition.",

I chose my size based on the chest size.  Since I'm larger busted, I went up one size, and it fits perfectly.  I like that it is more of an A-line dress and not straight.  It fits my bottom so much better.  The material is 100% viscose and it is so nice and soft.  It's machine washable, but I think I would hang to dry.  It's a very comfortable dress and would look great with a pair of sandals.  I would highly recommend!",
Tante L,Order up a size if you want loose. Not cotton like the traditional dresses in this style.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33CFNI0ETPQ0P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNK3C8KK,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Color: 01 ApricotSize: Large,,"I usually wear a M or L in tops or dresses- this Large ""just"" fits so I would say it runs a bit small. It's the shoulders and upper arms that seem on the small/slim side. The length is good and sizing through the hip is fine. I will be taking care not to put in dryer to insure I don't shrink it. This dress is very similar to the thin cotton Indian dresses I used to get 20 years ago or more- but this one is viscose rather than cotton. Still breathable but is sort of shiny and likely won't fade the same as the vintage cotton ones from India. Honestly I would prefer the thin cotton 'old school' version of these dresses but I just don't see them anymore so this one will do.",

If you are evenly distributed or between sizes, you may wish to order on the smaller size.  I used the steamer to remove wrinkles; worked great.  I love the gathering on the sleeves.  Design is great and looks good on me. Everything seems well sewn.  You could dress this up or dress it very casual with flip-flops (my style).  The red is more of a rose-red; it looks fabulous with the black accents.  Love it!",2

It can go anywhere and be appropriate whether it’s through a hotel lobby or local restaurant. Length and sleeve length are perfect.  I’m shorter than most so I can really appreciate a proper fit.
