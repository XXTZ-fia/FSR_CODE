They're really comfortable and lightweight. I just tested them on a 15 hour road trip and 🤌🏻. I ordered an XL because I like a bit of a looser fit. I'm 145 lbs and 5'2.,

Two out of the four rolls were the same print I was expecting them all to be different like in the picture. Didn’t necessarily need duplicates of the same wrapping paper bought for the assortment.,Perfect,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I0TN2GP22EYH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYPF3KQS,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 14, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Yellow,Verified Purchase,"Comfortable, pretty Silky material light airy summer pants. They are so pretty and have a boho flare you can dress them up and were them out or just lounge in them. They are great. The flower detail is soo cute. Fits true to size. What a great pair of light not heavy summer pants. I definitely will be ordering another pair.",

Amazon Customer,Cute but not for tall girls,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1W22PNJW7N2QS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYPF3KQS,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 15, 2024",Size: MediumColor: White,Verified Purchase,"Super fun print and ok material. From my try on it seemed ok but maybe not super breathable. My true issue is the length. I'm 5'9"" and these hit me mid calf versus the ankle like the model. So I'm returning them. Might try the large but don't think it will add much length. Worth the purchase if you 5'7 ish or shorter",
cat,"These are a dupe, they’re fine",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M1EWMVPWIXG5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYPF3KQS,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 24, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Dark Green,Verified Purchase,"These pants are a free people dupe, the photos are literally taken off the free people website. I noticed that after I ordered so I was skeptical but these are fine. I like them, they’re comfy and fit nicely. I’m a size medium, I have thick thighs and a booty and these fit nice on me. I prefer to wear them high waisted for comfort which takes away from the slouchy look at the ankles but they look cute at your hips and high waisted! The fabric is by no means “good quality” but consistent with most Amazon fashion. All in all I would rather spend $20 on a piece of clothing like this then $78, maybe if I love them I’ll treat myself to the real deal and get a piece of clothing that will last a lot longer and be comfier. If I repurchase I would size up. If you have sensitive skin I would probably not get these as they feel like they could be itchy",2
AzSunshine,Color is off,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IAFCB6Q9SN8P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYPF3KQS,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 12, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Red,Verified Purchase,"Based on the photo, I thought the pants were a deep red but a tomato red! Super bright.  They’re comfortable and material is a little thin but I’ll wear them around the house.",
