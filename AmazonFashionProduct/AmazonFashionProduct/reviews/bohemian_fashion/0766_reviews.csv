It has a snap at the chest, which I would’ve had to add had one not already been there. It’s a very flattering dress and seems to just flow over any flaws or extra pounds.  I found it very true to size. I usually wear a size 6. I love how the front comes up a little bit to give the hi-low look, although the fabric really overlaps, so you’re not at risk of any flashing in the wind. It is not lined, but it is not sheer at all, and because  there’s overlapping fabric I don’t think you  need to worry about a slip. I got the green. It’s a beautiful color. Other colors may be more sheer. I found  the  dress is much more beautiful on then in the pictures. Very happy.",
