My past purchases have ALL been100% rayon with a nice soft drape and flow right out of their packages.  THIS purchase is NOT rayon, is NOT soft, and DOES NOT have the same dye quality, and IS NOT a densely woven material as what I have experienced with ALL my other purchases from Bangkok Pants. Plus, the waist hem is 1/2 as wide when compared to all my other pants and skirts from Bangkok Pants. The feel of these pants are of a stiff see through polyester mix.  The color and design of these Boho Peacock Black pants -not the usual peacock design- is lovely, but the change to a lesser quality material and the smaller waist hem is a game changer.  The quality is just not there as it used to be.  I haven't hand washed them yet to see if they'll soften up, because I'm trying to decide whether or not to return them.  I uploaded pictures to try and show a comparison with past purchases of pants from Bangkok Pants.  The stiff pants, to the left, hang like cheap polyester curtains with rounded folds, whereas the past purchased pants hangs flat (and have always hung flat right out of its package -and before washing).  The second picture shows the smaller hem compared with two other pants from the same store. I, also, noticed the tag is a different color and stiff as well. The tag on the stiff pants that I'm negatively reviewing today, states ""Made by Fair-Trade."" My past purchases all have the same tag, ""Made with ♥️."" Tags on clothing is a sure way to find a 'knock- off' of the real thing.  My past purchases have all been 5 stars; this last purchase is 1 star. Too bad the 1 star seemingly reflects on the 5 star ratings as well. Gosh, I'm so disappointed that Bangkok Pants would do this to their customers.  Update: Another difference - When compared to the same sizing of my other Bangkok Pants, the sizing is smaller. Since these pants do not match their description, I'm returning them.",7

Either they are 5' tall and are upset they pool around their feet, or they are 5'11"" and feel that their palazzo pants should not end up looking like shorts, understandably! I would so much rather then be way too long than too short, even if by only one and a half inches. ANYONE can take a pair of scissors and cut an inch strip off the bottom of their pants. But, I've been sewing since I was 8 years old and it's not hard but it's just annoying to have to add fabric to the bottom of your pants just so that they look good! Especially when you just paid 30 bucks to purchase them in the first place! And now you've got to try and find a piece of fabric that's close to the same feel and also the same color? Heaven forbid you get a pattern cuz then that'll never happen! It's happened to me more times than I care to admit! If you ask me they should just make all pants like these with a 35"" inseam &  50"" total length and then just call it a day and if somebody needs to alter them then you have the excess to work w/! So, like I said in my video and I'm sure already five times here, these black hippie pants that you're looking at now claim a 30"" inseam, but it's actually 26. I am still happy that they are as long as they are, but the only reason that I bought them was because they were $20, cute and long!! 4 in is not an oopsie! Especially If you make clothing FOR A LIVING! There is NO excuse for ""accidentally""  being 4"" off in ur measurement! I'm sure that they don't want to make them longer because that's extra fabric and it's money spent. So instead they just lied about the length after reading a bunch of reviews where people are mad because all the Palazzo pants on Amazon are too short! And that right there is bs! So, yeah. Your choice. Don't get him if you wanted them specifically for the longer inseam. But they are still pretty darn cute and they feel good! And I'm sure as long as you hand wash them the last awhile. They're not see through either like some people say. Some people just like to complain! Good luck and HAPPY SHOPPING!!!",33
