It will not be confused with a “Johnny Was” but it’s pretty well done. Here’s the weird thing: it was shipped in a clear plastic bag. Not a bag within a clear plastic bag… no. The shirt was in a zip lock style plastic bag with the address label on it. The zip lock was not taped or otherwise secured - it could easily have been unzipped in the shipping process. Mine was just fine, but be aware that everyone will see what you’re getting, and it may/not arrive intact. I posted a photo of the shipping bag because it was so weird. Now that’s about if the way, onto the shirt. It’s lined so the embroidery on the chest and collar won’t scrape you up. I hand washed it immediately and a ton of black dye ran out. I added some fabric softener and let it drip dry. The dried shirt was not as truly inky black as it was before I washed it, but it is still black, and it felt soft after it dried. The red thread was not affected by the black dye runoff. Trust the sizing chart, and if you’re on the cusp ORDER UP. It does not stretch even a tiny bit. I’m not bananas about the seam directly under the red pattern on the chest, it reminds me of maternity wear. I am not skinny - which Im OK with - but at the same time I don’t need my clothes to be working against me, ya know? It’s not so long that it covers the hips, but it falls over the waist so it is not a junior sized shirt. I will wear this with jeans when the weather gets cool enough. Wearing this with leggings will not work for me because it does not cover my derrière or hips. The embroidery quality is very nice, not junky. Im a major Johnny Was fan so I am comparing this shirt to JW, which I know is not fair. But, through my eyes, this is what I see and how I feel.",8
