Also, the sleeves flair out wide at the wrist, giving this shirt a somewhat feminine vibe. Not really what I was going for.",

The shirt is simply amazing. The sizing was spot on as I have a 44.5 inch chest, and the medium provided just the right amount of room. The shirt wasn't too loose or too tight. If you're unsure about sizing, go with your regular size and it should fit great.  The quality of the shirt is fantastic. The fabric is a blend of polyester and linen which gives it a really nice texture and feel. It's also handmade and embroidered, which adds a touch of uniqueness to the shirt. The only downside was that the packaging left a bit of a chemical smell on the fabric, but a quick wash resolved that issue.  The design of the shirt is very versatile. It can be worn as a casual beach t-shirt or dressed up with a nice pair of slacks for a semi-formal event. I particularly like the V-neck and the long sleeves with button cuffs. The shirt also features a caftan-style design which gives it a really nice flowy and comfortable feel.  One thing to note is that the piece of fabric in place on the inside of the sleeves, which holds them up, is a bit long. It would be nice if it was shorter, but this is a minor issue.  Overall, I'm very happy with the JoZorro Men's Polyester Linen V Neck Henley Shirt. The quality, design, and fit are all excellent. I would definitely recommend this shirt to anyone looking for a high-quality and versatile piece.",
