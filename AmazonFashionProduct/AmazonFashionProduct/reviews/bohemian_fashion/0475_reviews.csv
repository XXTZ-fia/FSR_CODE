The fit of the shirt is not as expected; it runs a bit larger than standard sizing. I would recommend checking the size chart before purchasing to ensure a proper fit.  Additionally, the quality of the stitching is not as sturdy as I would have liked. After a few wears and washes, I noticed some loose threads, which could potentially affect the shirt's longevity.  While the shirt is advertised as suitable for yoga, the fabric's texture may not be ideal for intense physical activity. It's more suitable for casual and relaxed occasions.",

It was soft but thick enough in texture to where you could feel the cotton breathe through and as well as the way it fits comfortably on the body without making the frame of your body feel misguided.

The bottom edge is straight with about one-inch straight vents on both sides.  The washing instructions say to wash it only in cold water, and do NOT tumble dry. So you’ve gotta baby this thing.

I haven't washed it yet so it may shrink a bit, but when it arrived it was about an inch too big at the shoulders which then put the sleeves at my elbows. Even at the slightly large size I like it though.  One think that wasn't apparent from the pictures is that the rivets in the shirt are bright silver color. I'd have preferred black or bronze but the silver is okay. The tag says 80% cotton and 20% linen so it is all natural fiber. I've found some cases where the tag doesn't match the product information so it's good to see that confirmation of fabric right on the shirt.  All in all, I really like this shirt.",

As the title of this review says, it is very long. The bottom hem hangs below my crotch and completely covers my butt. Because of this, you pretty much have to pair it with very long shorts or some pants. For a casual summertime shirt I was surprised by how heavy the fabric seems. I purchased it in navy and the dark color plus the weight of the fabric made being in the Florida sun a bit uncomfortably warm. I wouldn’t want to be outside all day while wearing it.  I like the v-neck with the tie and the shoulders fit perfectly. Realize, though, that this shirt is very roomy and not at all sheer, so if you were hoping that it may let you show off some muscle, you’re going to be very disappointed. I’m also not sure thin guys are ideal candidates for this cut. It would probably look pretty good on much beefier men than I am.  I truly do love the Coofandy brand and I hate to be negative about this shirt, but you can’t win them all. If the shirt shrinks to a non-comedic length after a few washes I’ll let you know.

I order a large, and it is perfect. - The black color absorbs heat much faster, so I should have known better. - I have a hairy chest, so I either have to shave it or wear a layer under it. - I feel more vulnerable to sunburn around my neck since this shirt cannot protect my skin.
