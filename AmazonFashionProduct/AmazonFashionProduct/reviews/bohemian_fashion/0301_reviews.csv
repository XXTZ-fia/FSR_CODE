Musicbookfan,So versatile! Flattering.

Super versatile! I've been using this with clothes because throwing this on levels up any outfit. I paired it the other day with a tank top and long biker shorts - super comfy look that had some style to it as well. Can also be used as a beach cover up, nice to have something lightweight over a swimsuit when walking to/from the car, up to get a food order, etc. Very lightweight, perfect for travel or tucking into a tote for a day out. I plan to order more colors! Would recommend!  SIZING: I ordered a Small and the fit is perfect. I wear a size Med in tops and dresses, this is generously sized so I went with a Small and am glad I did.",10

I did look at the measurements before ordering, so I thought it would be perfect for me, but it didn’t even cover my chest. I will probably still wear with jeans or shorts and probably leggings with a cami underneath, but if you’re my size, it won’t fit like the model. Even the largest size, and my bust isn’t that large lol! I am 5’4, 225 lbs and wear a 44C. I ordered a 3X. It fits great everywhere but does not completely close in the front. But I like my kimonos like this to fit big and flowy. This one just didn’t do that unfortunately. The shipping and delivery was great and on time. The black was beautiful and it washed great on delicate. I dried it just a couple minutes to get wrinkles out and hung it up. It didn’t have a bad smell when I received it. It just smelled brand new. Hope this helped you decide!",
