The fabric is soft, okay stitching, and flows nicely. The thing I didn't like what when I went to tie the two dangling fabric pieces around my waist (this is to secure the dress, so it does not fall), the other side of the fabric does not have the outside pattern—it's just white. So when you tie the wrap at the front of your waist, you see unsightly white fabric underneath the wrap fabric and ruins the whole look. I tried to tie the waist wrap in a way that the underside would not be visible, but it's just not possible. I wish the pictures had shown this. To fix it, I may have to stitch a matching green fabric under the belt wrap. Also, two pockets would have made this dress perfect, but I already knew that this would be pocketless.",6

As a curvy girl, I chose to modify the skirt by removing the elastic rows at the top since it accentuated my belly most unflatteringly and because I will never be wearing this as a dress. It would be nice for the skirt to come with an option to forego that ruching since we aren't all lucky enough to be stick thin with flat stomachs! But the real disappointment was the way it was shipped. Just a label slapped on the inventory bag, mostly transparent, not sealed, clearly readable labels identifying exactly what's in the package and even what size.

Then wear the skirt as high wasted as you feel comfortable. I have had friends try to wear it low and with a loose shirt and they hated it until I told them to tuck it.

If you want to use this as a dress the ties can either go under the bust or around the neck like a halter top. A short liner keeps it from being too sheer. The stretchy ruching makes for a comfortable fit. Update: I dropped this to 3 stars because even though I washed this on the delicate cycle, that caused about a 1” tear in the seam between skirt and stretchy part. I know the directions said to hand wash but I feel it should be a little more durable. It is an easy fix but does speak to the quality of the product.",
