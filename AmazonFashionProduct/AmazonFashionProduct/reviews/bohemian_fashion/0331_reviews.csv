My favorite is the navy blue with white piping, which is about as classic as you can get. This dress looks great on its own or paired with a cardigan or jacket.  I love that I can adjust the blouson top to work with my figure. The dress flows over and camouflages my belly, and I can use the elastic waistline to make sure the hemline hits me right below my knee cap, which is the most flattering spot on me.

Go grocery shopping in it, walk your dog, or take a nice leisurely stroll in the park. You will turn heads in this for all the right reasons! The mandala print is eye-catching with shades of sky blue again deep orange-red tones. It's wonderfully loose and cool, but its not a shapeless shift. Sizing is generous.
