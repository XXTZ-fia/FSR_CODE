Order true to size or size down for a more fitted dress. I wanted big and roomy. Got xxl and it's perfect. Normal size is 18/20 42dd bra, big belly. Lots of free flowing extra space in the belly area. The only issue is the white is see thru and you can see the darker color under garments. So wear nude under garments and it should be fine. It is a little warmer since it is like t-shirt material but still a good comfy summer dress.",

I bought this XL and an XXL (which was way too big but I'm keeping it anyway...the review here is for the XL which would be the appropriate fit, and for the color of both sizes that I got).  If these didn't have pockets (I know...most people have this huge ""omg it has pockets"" thing but in this case, not so much) I'd have given it a 5 star rating.  I don't know if it's because I'm short but the pockets are really low...like they're lower than where jeans pockets sit.  Also, they're not sewn correctly, so they kind of pucker at the bottom of the side seam where the pocket opening bottom is.  The positioning makes the pockets stick out.  And it's not just this one, it's both that I bought, in different colors and sizes.  I bought these as bathingsuit coverups while sitting out by a pool on a cruise, so I don't burn, so it's not a big deal, but it make me look like I have bigger thighs? Like...they stick out a bit.
