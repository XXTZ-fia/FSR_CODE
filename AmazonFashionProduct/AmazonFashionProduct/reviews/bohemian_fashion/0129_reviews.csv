This is not a thick cozy sweater like it looks It is a very thin material. It also seems a lot shorter than what it looks in the picture both the sleeves and down at the waist. The sleeves are too short for me so I have to roll them up. I bought this because I had a baby not long ago and I was hoping for something a little bit looser around the midsection like it looks in the photos, but it’s really not that loose in the mid section and shows everything. Overall, this shirt is fine like I said I plan on wearing it again and probably would’ve rated it higher if it wasn’t for how misleading I feel the pictures are.",

I was expecting yarn type like wool. I love the colors the green and burgundy look great. they fit well and the three buttons are on the side of the sleeve.
