Amber Kiker,No plunging neck line.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38M3IR73YW7VR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096RBHMMN,"1.0 "," the United States "," March 5, 2023",,Verified Purchase,Totally not what is pictured. The neckline is super high up. The sleeves do have cute little frills at the bottom.

InnocentBystander,pleasantly surprised + update,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QDH84KMIJZWN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B096RBHMMN,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 26, 2022",Size: X-LargeColor: A1 Light Yellow,Verified Purchase,"Ok so the reviews for this shirt are extremely varied, so I’m going to give as specific of a review as I can.  #1 I wear predominantly black shirts. It’s a lewk. However lately I have been feeling like I want to ditch the black and try bright colors. I ordered something in pink, another thing in a really nice tie dye combo, and then this bright ass yellow blouse. I’m happy to say that I really like the color life lol. Everything I got works. And that includes this item.  The reviews are concerning.some people said it was absolute garbage too big cheap not the same as the listing pictures, etc. The pictures by reviewers were reassuring, though. I figured I’d give it a shot. I am 5’2” 170 with a big D/DD chest. I ordered the XL in this shirt.  There is No question that it is not high end quality. The material is definitely cheap and not pleasing to the skin in any capacity. There isn’t even a tag in it. It also is definitely not whats in the photo but as a serious Amazon user I learned long ago that any company with a weird name and headless pictures means I’m only buying something *similar* to the photo. Like a “if you like this look, then you’ll like what we send you” kinda thing. I’ve accepted that. So I got this with uncertain, but realistic, expectations. It fits the look I was going for, so I’m relatively satisfied. At least with this one.  The fit Is perfect from top to hip, and then it gets boxy and long. It is like tunic length on me, although I am only 5’2”. See pics for reference. I also like tunics so I don’t know I could probably make it cute dressing it up a bit as a tunic. But generally I plan to wear it French tucked. I actually could hem it bc I have some hemming tape so who knows I might do that. But the sleeves are great, the color is awesome considering it is bright assssss yellow, and also considering I literally have 20 black shirt s in my closet and dresser. You’d think I’d run away from this but no I like it. Beware though Even with the lining under it it is still fairly see through. Must wear nude colored bra with this.  How will I wear this? For now probably with jeans and high sandals, or dress pants and flats. I want very badly to wear it with leggings but all my leggings are, you guessed it, black and bc I got yellow I think I’ll look like a bumble bee. But maybe not though. Not sure yet.  Either way I am definitely keeping this AND looking at other colors. I hope whatever other one I order Is just like this one and not all effed up. It’s worth ordering and seeing if you like it.  Update: worn this a few times and I did wear it as a tunic w leggings and flat sandals. Got a lot of compliments on the color and just cute shirt in general. I also went and bought a long sleeved navy blue option and it is just as awesome.",613

If you have a large bust and a short waist, this is not the shirt for you. It is cut very straight, and it was way too long on me. The check is much higher than in the picture. So there is no hint of the decolletage. Plus the bottom of the gem is stiff, so tucking it in like in the picture is not an option either, as it sits funny because the lace is very stiff. The blouse itself was a pretty color, but there is a faint pinstripe that I did not see on the picture that I was not a fan of. The sleeves are a good width, but not elasticized as it looks in the picture. Overall I think the top is pretty if long and straight works for you.",2

It's well made, flattering, and true to size. The front of the blouse is lined so, while it's sheer, you can't see through the front. I'll wear a flesh-colored bra and should be fine. The fit is just what other reviewers have said: it's a fairly generous cut so choose your size based on how fitted you want it to be. I'm 5'8"", 145 lbs. and bought a medium. The shoulders fit properly and it's comfortable around the chest with enough room to make it loose but not baggy. If I wanted a slim fit, I could probably have bought a small. This is a pretty blouse and one that will good for any occasion.",2

I ordered a medium and it fits well. 5’6.5”, 165#, 36D bust. Easy care- I wash on gentle cycle and hang dry. I would give it 5 stars if it didn’t develop the separation that needed mending.",23

It’s lined. I got the burgundy colored one, and you definitely cannot see through it. The shoulders and arms definitely fit like a smaller size than what I ordered. If you carry any extra weight in your arms or have slightly wider shoulders, you’d benefit by sizing up. The only downside is the shirt is slightly low-cut, so if you make it oversized, you might need to wear a camisole or some thing underneath for modesty. I definitely buy it again, but just in a larger size. For reference, I normally wear a large, but should’ve ordered a XL.",42

This blouse is pretty, and is not too low cut, as I feared based on some of the pics. It is sheer, yes,  but I gave it only one star for sheerness bc the lining makes it opaque so I don't feel self-conscious. The sleeves are the sheer part, and it's only semi-sheer. You can just barely see my tattoos through the sleeves. The most important detail for me to share is this fits like a tunic, not a blouse! It is long on me - covers the crotch long - which to me, defines the fit of a tunic. It is flowy, not fitted, and since it is so long would love for the waist to be tapered a bit more. But it's still cute. I would wear this with leggings as opposed to jeans because on my frame it is too long to wear with jeans and not look silly. That being said, I still like this and will be keeping it, despite it not being what I was expecting! I would even consider getting it in another color.",13
