Brenda B.,Great Shirt... Sizing Issues,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HEJY3YPRO7GF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P78KF8D,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Size: 3X-LargeColor: 633sgr,Verified Purchase,"I want to give this a good review but it's not easy.  Normally I would give this 5-stars except for one thing....I was gifted a shirt exactly like this.  It is well made, it is not a thin, cheap cotton.  It is actually made very good, good seems and lovely embroidery.  In fact, I love it so much that I tracked the seller down on Amazon to buy in another color.  The label in the shirt guided me easily to the Amazon seller.  Great selection of colors.  There was one issue though.... the shirt gifted to me was sized XXXL.  I am not even close to what an XXXL would be in the US.  But this shirt was made in China, I know there are sizing discrepancies when dealing with Chinese products, and I figured it ran small.  Anyway, I ordered the new shirt in size XXXL because that's how my previous shirt was sized.The shirt came, everything was great about it, nice heavier cotton, beautiful embroidery... and when I tried it on, it fit me like an XXXL normally would.... like a tent.  It was waaaaay too big.I called my friend and asked her about the original shirt she gave me.  She admitted that she did not buy for me originally, but for another friend who is on the larger size.  The shirt was too tight for her even though she would really not be considered quite an XXXL.  So it seemed that the sizes would run small.The original shirt was great.  But the re-order.... not so great....because of the sizing.I am returning because of the size.  But I will not reorder in a size L - which is probably closer to what I should have ordered - because of the size discrepancy AND I hate returning things.If you don't mind taking a chance on the size, I would recommend this shirt, it's really nice and the price is very reasonable.  Pricewise, this shirt is a good alternative to the beautiful shirts made in Mexico.  Find one in your color and a size that fits, and I'll bet you will want to order another color also.Sizing really is a huge factor when rating things.  Otherwise, 5 stars.",

I even went to Mexico to look for one but they had no GRANDE. most of the ones on Amazon are not cotton which was one of my must haves. This cotton is thick, sturdy. I normally wear a large or extra large in stretchy tops. This was has no stretch so I ordered an xxl. I washed it right away to get the stiffness out. It washed up very nice. I hung to dry. I probably could have gotten away with an extra large as it is not fitted, but this works out fine and if need be I can take in The sides. I love that it comes in black, afterall that’s my signature color. Ha ha. The embroidery is machine done.  The only negative to me is it’s not made in Mexico. You guessed it! It’s China.  Now if they’d make a dress like this with pockets, I’d be smiling ear to ear.",5
