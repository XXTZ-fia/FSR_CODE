I wore the yellow a couple times before washing.  I washed it in luke warm water, gentle cycle, tumbled with no heat and then hung it to dry in my 69 degree bathroom.  I could not have treated this garment with more care!  It shrunk SIGNIFIGANTLY!  The top is now fully form fitting where it hung off of me in a perfectly relaxed and flowy fit before.  NOT HAPPY!  Excessive shrinkage is a mark of poor quality and should be disclosed to the buyer, size up.  So now I am afraid to wash the red one.  Also, FYI, the yellow has a draw string, no elastic and no pockets. The red has elastic, no draw string, and it does have pockets.

The style is flattering. 25 of those 150# were added during Covid and mostly in my gut. As someone who has been pretty slender up until now, it's tough for me to judge what styles will minimize versus maximize those extra pounds. This dress is a winner.  I paired with a 3/4-sleeve sweater for the office. I don't think I realized it had pockets when I ordered it, so it was a fabulous surprise. Pockets are especially helpful when wearing to the office as I have to carry both my entry badge and my phone. The pockets are good sized, but disappear into the draping of the dress. (Some pockets can be very obvious and look awful.) As someone else mentioned, the flowers at the base of the navy blue dress are more orange than they appear in the photos. The smaller ones in the dress could pass for salmon or coral, but the trim is very bright and clearly more orange with bright turquoise. It's really very pretty.",
