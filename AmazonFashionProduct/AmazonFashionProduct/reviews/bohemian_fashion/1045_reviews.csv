You could definitely wear this for work and not look as if you had a cheap blouse on. I think the fabric isssues are balanced out by the style and fit of the blouse. I thought it was a perfect fit and exactly what I was expecting and the fit was flattering. The sleeves were puffy enough to look stylish and the fit was not like a swingy tunic.

Chris Cummings,Flattering V-neckline and fits -- but hand-wash only?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FP0I1SJ576VE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCXXBS1N,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 16, 2023",Color: GreenSize: Medium,,"This flattering V-neck blouse fits as expected with more than 10 generous inches of drop below the natural waistline, but this is not long enough to be a ""tunic top"" as described. The full-length 2.25""-wide sleeves can be shortened without cuffing or using hidden elastic bands.  It's hand-wash only, though, making it a tough decision to wear it -- or keep it. Also, the green color is slightly dull compared to the picture; I would have preferred a more saturated color.  The front neckline tends to creep higher as the weight of the back likes to hike up the front. Uneven stitching is also evident across the back.  Bottom line: It's pretty, but why buy something you have to wash in the sink?",3
