The elastic waist keeps them in place, but easy to take on and off. I find the fabric thickness just right for my use. They may be a little thin if I wore them out of the house.  I both like and dislike the elastic on the bottom of the legs. They can hike up, then they stay up and I have to push them down. But yet, if I want them up, they stay. These are a bit short on me. I'm just shy of 5'9"", but I'm more leg than torso. More length would be nice so they covered my ankles.",
