The design of the top includes ruffle sleeves, a crewneck, and Swiss dots, which are supposed to be feminine and versatile. The color of the top is beautifully deep, just as it appears in the pictures. However, the fabric is a bit too thick for me, making it less useful for hot weather. Additionally, it's cut looser than I expected, which makes it feel baggy rather than elegantly loose.  The top looks great with leggings and jeans, but it might only flatter certain body shapes. Due to its delicate details, it requires careful washing, which raises questions about its durability over time. While it comes in nice colors, its practicality for summer and overall durability could be improved. It's a decent choice, but there are some drawbacks to consider.",5
