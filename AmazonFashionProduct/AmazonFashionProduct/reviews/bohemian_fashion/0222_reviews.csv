I'm 5' 5.5"" and 132lbs and ordered the Small. I maybe could have gone with the XS, but didn't want them to be any shorter since they are already cropped. I hang mine to dry because I don't want them to shrink at all. And when you're bloated, they are the best!",

At first glance it looks like a sundress. The torso hangs neatly and is not baggy. The sides are cut very deep so an inch or two of skin shows on the sides. (Just a peek. Nothing inappropriate for a “grown up”.) The bib provides nice front coverage. During the summer I wore them with  a bandeau top or bralette/halter type top. When the weather turned cool, I wore them with a long-sleeve T-shirt. These overalls are so cute they can easily go from the garden to running weekend errands with sandals or sneakers.",

I'm 5'4 and typically size 16, and this fit great. It's a tiny bit long but with platform sandals or boots it's perfect - definitely not as long as most of the ones I've tried on before.

They are thick enough to hide your body, but don’t make you hot. They are seriously adorable. When I was 145 I got a large and am 5”2.

I am currently 169 and 23 weeks pregnant and have been wearing them with a long cardigan during winter. I will be able to wear them my whole pregnancy with the give it has. If you want that cozy artistic vibe, get the right size. I don’t like mine super tight. From the left one in the picture it is the coffee, which is a beautiful rich burnt orange and is not like this pink orange you may see in some photos that can throw you off on which one to get if you’re looking for a deep burnt orange color. The middle is the camel and I thought it was more of a tan, but reminds me of a cappuccino color. It’s really pretty and neutral. The other one I have to the right, I can’t remember the color, but it’s like a mustard color.  Cannot recommend these enough. They hold up SO well being dried in the dryer and don’t shrink either. I have a dark pea green one too not in the photos and love it. Can’t recommend enough!",9

The length of the legs is insane, and the straps are so long, I also have to shorten them.

Great material- not too thick for summer and not too thin for cooler weather. Works well in the fall with a light cardigan or denim jacket and tolerable with a tank top in 90°. Washes a little softer than it arrived. Did not dry it, probably won't to keep integrity. Like linen, it expands and grows as you wear it throughout the day so after combing through all the reviews, I went with size small. I'm 5'7"", 165lbs, 38C. These are cropped on me (depending on how I adjust the shoulder straps, they're pretty much always above my ankles.) They are quite wide which I ended up really liking. Olive & Camel colors are perfect all year round, in my opinion.  Updated 11/24: I did end up drying all of them and they did shrink more in length so now they're more like Culottes but I'm ok with that. Due to the linen-like material, it still ""grew"" width-wise as the day progressed. I might try an XSmall next time and not dry them but I think they'd just be way too short for my 5'7"" frame.",9
