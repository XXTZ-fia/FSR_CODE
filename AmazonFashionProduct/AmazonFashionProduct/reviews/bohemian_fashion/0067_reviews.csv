The colors are pretty and the sleeves make it look even more feminine.  The pockets are not really located in a good spot…they just make your hips look bigger. I think perhaps someone else had the same idea because I believe the dress I received was a return. It wasn’t shrink wrapped like other clothing I’ve purchased; it was just folded up and stuffed into the zip up bag. Not a deal breaker because I wash everything before I wear it. As for the pockets, I’ll just sew them up. 🙂",4

"This wagon is fantastic. I was so satisfied with the first one I purchased that I bought a second one exactly the same color and size as the first one.  I use them in my storage room at my house to keep lawn furniture cushions and other small items that I store away in winter. When summer rolls around, it’s so easy to roll the wagon outside and put all the cushions and other things in the yard at once. I will also use it for the beach and picnics. It was fully assembled when it arrived and all I had to do was take it out of the box and stretch the wagon open.",Black Dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11DC27OD84W96/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CW61TK9S,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 1, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,Verified Purchase,Cute black dress.
