On me, the neckline is scooped. That is fine, and it will better for work.  I was really surprised by the fabric. Nice, sheer, and  really soft.  It isn’t itchy and it is airy. It drapes nicely. How much more could anyone who wants to hide some lumps and pumps and be cool in the hot sun ask for?  Go for it.",16

It looks just like the images. Big plus for the use of matching black chiffon fabric to bind the neck opening. However, the chiffon quality is slightly below average, meaning that the fabric is not as flowy or opaque as better quality chiffon fabric. The looser weave (lower thread count) means it is more prone to snagging, which happened to my top after washing and steaming out the folds. The construction is also imperfect, with a series of small puckers along the side seams. Still like it and will wear it over a sleeveless black dress for a nice pop of color.",
