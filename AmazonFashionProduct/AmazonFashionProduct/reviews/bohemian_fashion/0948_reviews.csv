FlyingSnail,"Comfortable and flattering but thin, and pockets a bit small.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG90P1ZKCK0A3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6GHS98S,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 21, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I am 5'2"", usually size 12, and I got the Large size. It fit with a few inches to spare around the butt (not too tight; just slightly loose) and the waist elastic was comfortable. They draped nicely and were flattering, but the length was _almost_ too much. With my thicker sandals (1"" wedge) they just skim the ground, which is fine, but low flats would make them a hair too long. (If I hem them up, I'd have to extend the side slit, which does look nice and helps them drape nicely across shoes, but that does not look difficult.) IMO, they would be a good length for people up to about 5'5"". I think they might look short on taller folks, but that is the current trend, I suppose...your choice. In this larger size, they do not flare like they do on the skinny model in the photo; they are basically just a wide straight leg, but they look fine that way.  The fabric is very thin, and probably not durable, but is breezy and light. I got black, so no worries about show-through, but with a lighter color, I would probably choose skin-colored underwear. The pockets (front only, no back), are comfortable as hand-pockets or for small items, but just barely deep enough for a phone; I would be concerned that it might slide out if seated.",31

I got the pink as depicted in the stock photo, and they are the color I expected them to be. They also run true to size- they fit well in the waist area but are not tight around the bottom area. The legs are wide and flowy but the material is not see-through (so often an issue with lightweight pants)- these are perfect for summer when you want your legs covered but don't want to sweat in tight jeans or heavy materials.  I saw a few reviews that said theirs shrunk- I haven't had that issue, but I also have not put mine in the dryer. I washed one time on the regular hot cycle and once on the cold cycle, hanging them to dry. They do get quite wrinkly, so I do have to steam them before wear. So far, they fit the same as the first time I got them, so maybe keep them out of the dryer.  Overall, big fan!",4

The stitching is really good and the hem line is nice, with a small slit at the bottom of each pant leg. The waistband is elastic but it does not roll so it’s flat even after machine washing. The drawstring is free flowing so make sure to tie it before machine washing just to make sure it doesn’t come out.  The fit is true to size. They are a perfect length for someone that is 5 feet 9 inches tall. They flex well when lounging, they do not seem to wrinkle as much as I thought they might and the design printed on the material is well done.  Since they are cotton, they do not stretch like other material so select your size accordingly. They are a little baggy in the legs like they are meant to be. Also, make sure to only wash them in cold water so they do not shrink.  These are nice pants at a good price point. They are versatile, so you can dress them up or dress them down depending on the event. Because of how well they are made and their comfort level I do recommend them.",18

They look like a completely different fabric than what is pictured in product images. The fabric isn't as drapey and flowy andthe legs aren't as wide and loose. The other problem is the length. They are shorter than I expected and the inseam is short. I do like them and I think they will work well for me, at least a little while longer.
