Jkgerst,Fits as expected & cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10N4FS512EOU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK8VVWPQ,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: Black-printed-03Size: Large,,"I ordered this hoping that it would be cute for summer when I live in sleeveless dresses.  This definitely fits the bill and will go into regular rotation.  The floral-patterned fabric and pattern looks fresh and flattering, and this will be great for traveling.I ordered the large and it fits my medium-sized shoulders and overall larger pear-shaped figure well.  (5' 10"", 165 lb, 36A).",
Vlad Pop,I love it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FF0SNX4G5TLG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK8VVWPQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: Green-printedSize: Large,,"I bought this dress for my girlfriend, and she's been wearing it quite a bit this summer. From what I've observed, it seems like a decent casual dress. The material feels like a soft, lightweight t-shirt material, which is good for warm weather. The floral print we chose looks nice, and the pleats give it a bit more shape than just a straight t-shirt dress. She says it's comfortable to wear, and the pockets are a definite plus. It seems to wash well enough, with no noticeable shrinking or fading after a few washes so far. It's definitely a casual, everyday kind of dress, not something for a fancy occasion. Overall, for the price, it seems like a good value for a comfortable summer dress.",
Anna L. Hagen,Gorgeous Print,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RVADF1P465IT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK8VVWPQ,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: Green-printedSize: Medium,,"I absolutely love the print on this dress. It's gorgeous. EXCEPT for the way it looks at the bottom on each side. There is a pattern along the bottom of the dress, but they did not even attempt to line it up at the side seams. It makes it look like the hem is folded under, and I know it is going to bother me.  Except for that detail, this really is a nice dress. It's soft and comfortable, feeling like a soft t-shirt, and it has pockets. The fit is loose, and the hem comes about to my knees. It will be a nice, casual dress to wear this next summer.",
E. Falconer,Love this dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJKKZ0LWKC4Z2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK8VVWPQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: Black-printed-03Size: Medium,,"This is a lovely summer dress. The pattern is simple yet elegant. The fabric is light and soft, perfect for a warm summer evening. I plan on bringing this on a cruise in March to wear.  Perfect with flats or heels, you can't go wrong.",
Andrea,A nice easy summer dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17NA5V3JVGVXA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK8VVWPQ,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: Green-printedSize: X-Large,,"Only good things to say. The A frame is flattering on all figures, and the midi length should also be good on all figures. For me, a tall pear shape, these are very flattering. This dress is sized well, and is soft and flowy.  The print is very cheerful and perfect for back yard parties, or parties down by the lake.The reason for the 3 stars is that for the very simple nature of this dress, I felt the price was on the high side. The dress is simple, almost a beach cover up,  and for the same price or a few more dollars you can probably get a better quality.  But for the record I do really like this.  Current price is $27.99",
Alexandria,Just ok,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Q7BYN4B176ZK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK8VVWPQ,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Color: Blue-printedSize: Small,,"Not sure if it’s me, the style, color, material or whatever however this dress looks like a nightgown on me.  Not flattering at all unfortunately.  Try other colors and downsize.",

Yes, I would recommend this dress, with a 5-Star rating for a quality product.",

Jd chester springs,Cool summer dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M2XGOW6WDUY6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK8VVWPQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 3, 2025",Color: Blue-floral PrintedSize: X-Large,,"This cute dress will be great for next summer. I ordered my usual XL and it fits as expected. Its flowy and light and it has pockets!  I am in my 60's and weigh about 190, 5'5"" tall if that is helpful. It hits me above the knee. Nice to wear around the house and nice enough also to wear out, for me, probably with a lightweight cardigan for coverage and overly air conditioned rooms. Very happy with this cute and bright summer dress!",

AJ,Green-Printed design review and photos,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RBFS3AWCG47O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK8VVWPQ,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 31, 2024",Color: Green-printedSize: Small,,"I ordered the size small green-printed dress. There wasn’t an X-Small option. I’m 5’5” 117 lbs. There is plenty of room in this dress. An extra small would have fit just fine if it has been available. I took these photos under a bright light and didn’t enhance the colors. I think the advertised colors of this dress give the impression they are slightly darker than they are. To me the colors are softer looking in person. The fabric feels cool and soft on my skin. Knee-length which is just right for me. A roomy dress that would be perfect to wear on a hot humid day, out shopping, or to meet a friend for lunch. Casual yet feminine. Has pockets deep enough to hold a phone or keys.",
christine langell,"Cute comfy beachey dress, so why not 5 stars?",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31U4I6Q9Q77MB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK8VVWPQ,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Color: Green-printedSize: Large,,"Well, I'll tell you. One of the things that drew my attention to this dress was the wide variety of bold, playful prints available. I already new the material would be soft and stretchy and durable. I am pretty satisfied with the style and accurate fit, but then turned to view the side. That just dinged my review a bit, because the manufacturer was not so conscientious about the way the printed pattern comes together at the bottom of the side seam. Like, it just doesn't. It's like it's pinched upward. It's not a deal breaker for me, cuz I'm old, but just an observation for those considering the type of pattern my dress has.",2
