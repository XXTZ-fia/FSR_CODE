Jake B.,So glad I bought this,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ENAQ0R05QDY1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07TK3G5V7,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2022",Size: LargeColor: Green Tones,Verified Purchase,"They are super comfortable and true to size.  I am 5'10'' and weigh around 150 lbs.  I went with a large, only because that was the only size they had available when I ordered them.  You see, I am a shark when it comes to shopping.  I pick it up, put it down.  Pick it up, put it down.  Add it to my cart and circle it over and over and over and over and OVER until I finally get a little stoned and finally commit to spending $30.00 on myself lol (I am sure I am not the only one who does this...right, right...RIGHT?)They are true to size and well made, plus super comfortable.  Keep in mind when buying these though, they are hand wash only.",10

I wear XL in gym/athletic pants.  I ordered XL of a different pattern of these pants from same vendor and trying these on they probably match the fit in XL gym/athletic pants, BUT 1) these are supposed to be a bit more flowing and roomy, and more importantly 2) these are 100% cotton and will likely shrink.  in fact, I'm counting on more than typical shrinkage based on the kind of loose knit cotton material, so I'm definitely not putting them in the dryer.

Tim,The Tight elastic stays tight...TOO TIGHT! The quality of the fabric is GARBAGE feels like cardboard,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LFS0ZQB7B5MT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07TK3G5V7,"2.0 "," the United States "," May 1, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Blue Tones,Verified Purchase,"First off, I bought this product when it was barely $20.... they got greedy and shot up the price to now $52 which is just absurd considering the crap quality of these pants.  They're not airy either, the pictures seriously do NOT do it justice, it's no wonder they're stingy with the pictures.  The quality seriously sucks. Even if you don't believe me and you buy it, you will feel and see for yourself.  $10 would be a more justified price of these and even then considering the quality and the construction of these it would still be questionable. The inside of them aren't comfortable, like I said the construction of them is horrible. The seams and meeting of the patches inside the pants all stick out, so they will itch you.  Why is it itchy? Well look at the crap quality of them. You'll feel for yourself if you do make the mistake of supporting this greedy company.  Good luck.  Hopefully this saves the next person from a mistake. I wish you can write replies to comments here so others can let me know of the mistake after they bought it 🙃.  Peace be with you.",4

Cory M.,The inseam is smaller than I'd like but otherwise fits fine and super comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PF4BA79SEGQ4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07TK3G5V7,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 13, 2022",Size: X-LargeColor: Green Tones,Verified Purchase,"I was originally looking for ""hippie"" pants to wear for Halloween and my girlfriend came across these and sent them to me. At first I thought I was looking for bell-bottom jeans but these are SO much better. I can't wait to wear these at Halloween and then continue to use them for lounge pants around the house. To be honest, they aren't my daily dress style but I can absolutely see someone eclectic wearing them out and rocking them hard. The only complaint I have is the inseam is smaller than I'd prefer (hugs the boys more than my preferred comfort level) but even with that they're still a very comfortable and high quality pant that I would recommend.",

I'm 5'6 and have rather long legs so I was pleasantly surprised when these pants actually fit me, height wise. I ordered the S/M",

THESE PANTS ARE MY FAVORITE THING THAT I OWN. JUST ORDER A SIZE UP TO BE SAFE (THE WAISTBAND IS VERY STRETCHY SO IF U NEED MORE ROOM FOR UR LEGS IT WILL STRETCH/COLLAPSE TO FIT UR WAIST) BUY. THESE. PANTS. THAT'S ALL. GOODNIGHT FOLKS.",
