Linda White,Nice Material & Nice Style! Not Vacuumed Sealed Thank You!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K15V2NUVEGUU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKXLHDD2,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 15, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"The drawstring is for looks & the tassels looked messy so I snipped the string off with no unwanted casualties! The material is old fashioned looking & the side splits.........well, the wide legs are split up to about 4"" above my knee. For reference purposes I am 5'7"" & 120ish. It looks like you have a skirt on that is split on both sides! These are OK pants, would not have gone looking for them but I am sure other ladies will love these! We all have our own style & this could be yours! Hope my honest review helps you!",

Philippa Alderton,Comfy pants.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R131PWZK6O1YGA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKXLHDD2,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,,"Back in the Dark Ages when I was in college, a fashion came along, pants called elephant bells. While I don't usually like very loose clothing, they fit me well, and these do too. The only quibble I have is the open lower leg. I got them to try, out of curiosity, and while the waist to thigh area fits well, loose but comfortable, all that fabric flapping around my legs was driving me nutz.  Think I might close them with some decorative trim or something, but other than that, these are very nice pants, well worth the price.",
SAM,Fun Summer Pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S1ZTLGCICF9Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKXLHDD2,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 9, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,,"These pants are super fun in their design.  They are made very well in a light airy fabric that flows in the breeze and when I walk.  Easy to wear with an elastic waist with drawstring and splits up the sides for an elegant sexy vibe.  Styled with an inner shorts lining for coverage since the fabric is thin.  These pants can take me from the beach to dinner out in their versatility.  They can be dressed up with heels and accessories or dubbed down for casual wear with a pair of sandals.  I am excited to pull these out when the weather warms back up.  Super fun pants with a lot of pizzazz.  My pants fit well and as expected, true to size, but add a size up and I would be absolutely thrilled as I have a bottom heavy figure.",
Deb Mericle,Very cute!  Split makes them fabulous!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJQS5FYYR9UPW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKXLHDD2,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 9, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"These high waisted flowy pants with a split up the side are so cute! They lay just right - not too baggy, and they have built-in shorts. So whatever color you go with will not be completely transparent where it matters!  I originally ordered a medium. I like them, but I feel like I would like them better if they were a little bit looser. So, I ordered another pair in large. I have not received those yet, but I intend to pass these on to my daughter and keep the larger size for myself.  I feel like I will get a lot of use out of these super cute pants, and I hope she will too! In fact, I hope they look just as great on you!",6
KAC,"Nice weight gauzy fabric, partially lined",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HE1JZ12SLP77/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKXLHDD2,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 1, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,,"These pants are much nicer than I expected. They are a thick gauzy like fabric. There's a nice subtle pattern in the fabric. I lightened a picture to show the pattern. The black is a true dark black. They are soft, very flowy and hang nicely.  The waist is elastic and the tie in the front is only for appearance, it doesn't adjust the waistband. The split in the side of the legs adds a great detail. It comes up to above the knee but not too revealing. They have a lining, kind of like shorts, that goes to about mid-thigh so they lay smoothly. I ordered my regular size and they are a little snug because of the lining. I think sizing up may be too much unless you want them really loose. They do not have pockets. Overall I like these pants a lot and look forward to warmer weather to wear them.",4
Forever Geralyn,"Boho Chic, Comfortable,  Lined with Built-in Shorts",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQHHGS53TL4YT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKXLHDD2,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 28, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Khaki,,"These pants are very boho chic! I love the terracotta color and seersucker fabric.  They are made very well.  I was pleasantly surprised that they are lined with built-in shorts. The elasticized waist band has great stretch and is comfortable.The side slits give these pants interest and movement.  They will be enjoyed when the temperatures rise as they feel so lightweight. I think that these pants can be worn both for a casual look as well as more dressier occasions.The only thing I think may be an issue for some is the length.  I'm wearing the size medium, and for reference,  I'm 5'6""and 127 lbs. As you can see in the photos where I'm wearing flat shoes,  I'm just getting away with not having to have them hemmed.  Also, there are no side pockets.  It's not a deal breaker,  but I would have loved them with these pants.  Bottom line? I'm happy to add them to my wardrobe!I posted some photos to give you a closer look and hope that they help you out a bit with your choice.  Thank you.",20
