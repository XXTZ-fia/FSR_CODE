They are perfect for dressing up or just wearing around the house. They run true to size, but at 5'3"", they run a tad long for me.",
caroline garcia,I like them BUT they are practically see through,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WSTX7KSEZYOG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN1H5P82,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 18, 2024",Size: LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"I like these but I must be too short for them because they are VERY high waisted, I keep them a little lower but then the pant legs drag a bit and the material is very see through.",

Amy Young,Awesome summer pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S8XR7UFB19L3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN1H5P82,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 11, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Light Green,Verified Purchase,I get so many compliments on these.

FB,Horrible,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21V24EVWVU6Z5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN1H5P82,"1.0 "," the United States "," June 23, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"These pants are horrendous. The rise is way too high, length too short and the hips are way too small. They are also completely see through and made of the cheapest fabric that’s super scratchy. Not at all as shown on the model.",5
Lillie,"Runs short on tall girls, run small in general",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA4CW59I3ST0B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN1H5P82,"1.0 "," the United States "," June 5, 2024",Size: LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,The cut is very awkward. They are very sheer even for white linen. Almost capris not long pants. I’m 5’8. Don’t recommend.,
S. H.,Soft and cozy - perfect for summer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DKYR7BHAN809/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN1H5P82,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 26, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Brown,,"Lightweight and thin, these are great pants for summertime in a hot, humid environment. The cotton fabric breathes very well, keeping you comfortable and cool. I got them in brown, and the color is dark enough that I didn’t experience any see-through problems, but I could see this being an issue with a white or light-colored pair because the fabric is so thin.  I ordered one size up, and I am glad that I did. I carelessly ignored the instructions to handwash these pants, and when I threw them in the washing machine they shrunk at least half a size. So make sure that you are either handwashing these or plan your sizing to account for shrinking.  Otherwise, these pants are very soft and very comfortable. They are a great addition to my loungewear collection.",4
KLB,Good for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3G3JAYSPMI15T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN1H5P82,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 25, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I like how these don’t wrinkle.

ekaje,Uncomfortable and unflattering!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VZS4DJ9PSSKM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN1H5P82,"1.0 "," the United States "," March 4, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Light Green,Verified Purchase,"SO tight and binding at the waist (and I have small waist!), huge droopy at the hips. The worst cut ever. Will never wear these.",

Amazon Customer,Lightweight,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK6SENLHZL2YN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN1H5P82,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 19, 2024",Size: MediumColor: White,,"I sized down because I didnt want to be swimming in these. Im 5'4 ~150lbs and the medium fits nicely. The only thing a little off to me in the length of the rise. They are not an all out drop crotch but if I wear them at my waist, they still sit several inches below the crotch which looked kind of funny to me when I tried it on. If I wear them higher up the torso (and maybe folded the waist down) then they'd be too short. Wearing them at my waist makes them the perfect length so if you're taller than 5'4 FYI these will likely be high-waters on you. There's also no pockets. I don't mind because I got the white color which are a little sheer and pockets would create that double lined look.",2
Nancy W,Can't wait for spring!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19WI0SBH7IG7Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN1H5P82,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 15, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"The pants arrived yesterday, tried them on and like the fit and the material.

amazon customer,Cute but casual,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JND5MU8NG27V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN1H5P82,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 31, 2024",,,"I love these pants but they are super casual like the title suggests. They are perfect to wear over swimsuits at the beach or pool, and they are great for running errands. They are just a little too see-through to wear to nicer occasions in my opinion. They fit really nicely and the draw string waist is nice so you can make them as tight or loose as you want. I am 5'1"" and they are long/baggy on me, but that is what I wanted when ordering them! Overall, I am really happy.",4
Sarah L,"Comfortable, but thin.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DSCX7V5RDUEL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN1H5P82,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Light Green,,"These pants fit well, but the material is very thin.  Pros: 1. Comfortable and light fabric, feels very nice. 2. Fit as expected, I ordered my usual size and they fit me well. 3. Color is just as pictured, I purchased in the green color and I love it!  Cons: 1. Material is very thin and with the lighter colors could be sheer at some times, choose undergarments wisely. 2. Fabric has a nice textured look, but also creases very easily and can’t be ironed without losing the nice texture. A quick tumble dry is the only option for fixing. 3. Cold water & gentle wash only, to avoid shrinking with the 100% cotton fabric.  Nice product overall.",5

I was concerned you'd be able to see through the material, but even though the pants are made of a cotton gauze fabric, you can't see through them (at least not the light green). I like how they fit and feel. The only thing that would make them better would be pockets.",2
Jessica,Soft and comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O04V9L8LAON6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN1H5P82,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Apricot,,"These miduo Womens Cotton Drawstring Elastic High Waist Palazzo Wide Leg Pants are so soft and fit well. I got the XL in apricot. I love the color, it will go with so many of my tops. The elastic band is nice and it can be tightened if the pants are too loose. The waist did not bunch up as I wore these throughout the day. There was no strong odor when I opened the package and the material is really lightweight and will be good to wear in the spring and summer. I tend to get overheated, so wearing them around the house during winter is working out well for me. I recommend these comfy wide-leg pants.",2
