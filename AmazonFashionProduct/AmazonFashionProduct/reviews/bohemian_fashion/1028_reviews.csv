The fabric is a medium weight jersey-type material and does not appear to be see-through. The colors are decidedly more autumn than I expected and go perfectly with the golden-tan colored pants I wore to work today.  I can definitely see myself wearing them together. The fabric is soft and there was no odd odor to this shirt.  It came well-packaged in a vacuum sealed bag.  I anticipate that it may wrinkle some given the material but that they wouldn’t be terribly noticeable due to the pattern.  Overall a good value for me.,
