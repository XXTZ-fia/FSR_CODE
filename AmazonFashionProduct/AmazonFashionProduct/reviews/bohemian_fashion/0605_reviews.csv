As a result of this editing, the real shirt looks NOTHING like the pictures. The photo shows e a rough, textured, loose linen shirt with a cotton drawstring run through stitched/cut holes, perfect for a renaissance fair costume. What I received was an ill-fitting, completely smooth, poorly stitched, synthetic blend, shirt with a plastic-y cord and hideous aluminum grommets. It's cheap garbage.  My favorite aspect of this that really drives home the zero care that went into this scam of a shirt is the packaging. It came in a bag that reads (verbatim, including the typos): ""This bag is made of piastic. Use it for as long as you like. However,when it is no longer of use do not leave it. In the countryside of the sea. Dispose of it in a refuse confainer THE WOTLD BELONGS TO US ALL WE MUST PROTECTITI.""  If they were so concerned about PROTECTITI THE WOTLD, maybe they shouldn't have manufactured a shirt that immediately made me want to follow the instructions and ""Dispose of it in a refuse confainer"".

I noticed it first about 8-9 months ago when we ordered an article of clothing on Amazon for my wife (a corset dress). The exact same listing, exact same item, but in 2 sizes to determine which one was a better fit. (It was not via the Amazon Wardrobe program).  One was branded appropriately complete with tags. It was high quality with good stitching, structure, and ribbing. The overall quality was as expected from this brand.  The second one was essentially the costume version of the item. It had no labels. The packaging was a plastic heat sealed bag. It had single stitching, no backing, no ribbing in the corset, shoe lace strings, and cheap rivets.  …and then it happened again with other clothing items. Sellers are mixing in very cheap versions of items with decent versions. They’re playing a numbers game on returns and reviews.  This shirt is one of those items. Simply read the reviews to see people who say they got a great linen shirt and others who say they got cheap crap. Once again, I got one of each. One with poor loose stitching and hanging threads, different material, and cheap feeling. One that drapes nicely and looks good and feels like the right material.  What’s really odd is that the XL and XXL both nearly fit the exact same way.",4
