I got the Color: A- White Red Floral and I very much like the colors and pattern.  The fit of this shirt is flattering.  The boat neckline fabric overlap is sewn in place, so the neckline keeps it shape.  The elastic cuffs fit just below my elbows and ride up to my elbows, making a small pretty poof.  The elastic fits nicely and is not restricting.  The hem hit nicely for wearing untucked and is a curved hem (not straight across.) The fabric is a soft jersey knit.  It is a polyester/rayon/spandex blend, so it will not shrink and should be easy care. The jersey knit is a medium weight and not very breathable.  I will be wearing this shirt in the Fall, not in the heat of Summer. For reference:  I am 5’4” tall, weigh 134 lbs. and wear a 36D bra.  I got a medium and it fits perfectly without being clingy or too loose.  My husband thinks it looks great on me and would make a good “casual date night” shirt.",3

It's been through the wash and it hasn't twisted at all, the seams are still straight. The pink/green colour is more flattering than the photos suggest. It has all the wearability of a t-shirt, but the sleeve shirring elevates it to something a little more special. The current price seems a little high at £23, hence after much deliberation I have dropped a star.",

I love the sleeves, the elastic keeps them nicely in place but isn't too tight. The fit is good, I got size Small and wear sizes 8-10 normally. The boat neck is too wide for my liking as all my bra straps show underneath. The fabric is quite shiny, which combined with the bright print does look a little cheap in my opinion.",

The cut is quite big and shapeless, there's lots of extra material under the arm even though I got the smallest size.",

It is definitely cream and not apricot. I am a size 16 and ordered an XL. The fit was ok. I would have preferred more natural fibres in the composition as it is 60% polyester. In saying that, the fabric was soft and smooth. The neckline goes more or less straight across the neck so if like me, you don't like anything touching your neck, then it's not for you.",

This top looks beautiful with a floral design on the white base design. This top is a little long hence comfortable to wear with leggings too. This top also goes well with denim.  It has a different neck which makes it the same at the front and back. The fabric has a good stretch. this top has 3/4 sleeves with elastic at the end.  This is a nice option for daily use but this is definitely not an occasional wear.  This top is true to its size.  Overall it is a nice top.",

I chose royal blue and the colour is lovely and vibrant.  I am a size 16 and opted for XL and it was nice and roomy and I could actually have sized down but it's nice to occasionally have a looser fit top.  The fit Is very flattering as it skims and does not cling.  The fabric is a lovely, soft almost jersey-like material.  It's got a nice slash neck top with detailing at the shoulder and shirring at the cuffs which are very comfortable and don't dig.  It's not too long in length but does cover a mum-tum or can be tucked in.  The images on the listing are true to life so I don't feel the need to add a photo to my review.  I'm actually considering buying this top in another colour as it is so comfortable and flattering for every day wear.",

I'm very surprised that the top isn't made from cotton as there is a good weight and the material is very premium feeling. The apricot and black floral design is more of a off white/cream colour than apricot.",
