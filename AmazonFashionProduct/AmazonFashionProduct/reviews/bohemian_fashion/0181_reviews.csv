I wear a 4 petite and it fit perfectly (a little loose as expected).  It washed well in the machine and hung it to dry.  It did not require ironing if hung immediately.  My wife recommends this shirt.,
Rose Marie Nogueras,Cute top accented by lovely embroidery,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2N8BP8QJ4DPR7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D91JP33L,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 26, 2022",,,"Very lovely blouse, the embroidery is an attractive feature. So many colors to pull from the embroidery to style with this blouse. I chose a brown skirt that is a light, comfortable material, perfect for hot summer days. It seems to match in my opinion. It was a little big for me in the cleavage area so when I sat it would sag a little. Double stick tape can take care of that and keep the blouse in place.",3

It is an oversized fit, but there is no give/stretch, so just be aware.  I would have given this 5 stars, but fabric is a little heavy for summer (it's lined).

Not too long and not too short. Very well made and it has like a half undershirt attached to it inside. Very pretty. I did end up washing and drying it unfortunately. It did spring the embroidery a little but it's ok. After I let it hang a little it was as good as new.,
nv,Beautiful and good quality for price but ...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3APPXVK0B0ABF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D91JP33L,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 14, 2022",,Verified Purchase,Shirt is as beautiful as it is on a photo and material is of nice quality. Nothing much different that what one would see in Johnny W** store ! Embroidery is nice also and it is generous in size. The only complaint I have is that head opening is on a small side. One would have first to dress up and than put makeup on and do the hair. This could have been easily fixed if there was a slit with tiny button in the back - I was saddened but had to return it.,2
Crystal Starr Light,Great new shirt for spring/summer!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VVTZUGT3SDD6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D91JP33L,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 9, 2022",,,"The peasant look is in, and while I hate that look to my core (being reminded of being a fat teenager during the late 90's/early 00's), I loved the embroidery on this shirt enough to look over the peasant-y nature of this blouse.  This shirt comes with a sheer lining, which wasn't clear from the picture - which is completely fine. The fit of the large is pretty good, though it was a bit snug on the hips (it is not nearly so flowy on me as it is on this model). The embroidery is extremely pretty especially on the rather unconventional grey color (but that's really what drew me to this color anyway). There were a few stray threads and some minor sloppiness, but nothing that overly detracts from the garment.  I've worn this several times and found it a great spring/early summer wear. It's light-weight, not too heavy, but the sleeves keep some of the cool off. All in all, I'm happy - of course, we shall see what happens in the wash!",3

Burlington East,Gorgeous but absolutely no stretch,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSH1XIGDT4B8G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D91JP33L,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 19, 2022",,,This shirt is absolutely gorgeous. The stitching and embroidery is impeccable and the fabric is soft and good quality. I was so excited about how beautiful this shirt is until I put it on and realized it had zero forgiveness for my curves. I have a large chest and curves and this shirt was not made for either. It was right across my bodice and bunched at my waist because it would not go down over my curves this was disappointing because the shirt really is exceptional. If you are less curvy it would be perfect and would also make a great gift.,

The size 2x fits my 48"" bust and the combination of red and burgundy embroidery on a black ground is stunning.  The cotton fabric is breathable and soft; I haven't washed it yet but would expect some wrinkling and shrinkage.  The blouse is well constructed, and the details are very nice.  I'm very pleased and think this top could be worn with jeans to go shopping, or with dressier pants to an office or museum.",
One for All,love it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3T89A47QBWC48/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D91JP33L,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 25, 2022",Special Size: WomenSize: LargeColor: White-075,,"Reviewed by spouse:  I absolutely love this! This top fits like a glove and the color of the embroidery is just beautiful. I’m wearing a size large and for sizing reference I’m 5’3, 155 and 34d and it’s a perfect ever so slightly oversized fit. The only thing I don’t love is this partial liner that it has in there it’s a little awkward. It would’ve looked better if they had went all the way to the bottom in the front but it only hits about the top of your natural waist or at the top of like a high-rise Jean. So I think I might try to take it out of there with a seam ripper cause I think it would actually be better without. I kind of scrunched it up to see if it would be too see-through and you could see my skin color of my stomach but I had a beige bra on and you couldn’t see it so I think it would be better without it. The lining is only in the front not in the back.",3

I have been replacing them with summer blouses that are a little more stylish. This blouse has a stitch work design that is beautiful and anything but boring. The fit is perfect. I ordered my regular size. I accidentally threw this in the regular wash and also dried. It appeared like I had made a terrible mistake. It looked terribly wrinkled and smaller. I put it on a hanger and took out my travel steamer to see if I could revert it back to its original appearance. Voila! It steamed out perfectly. I love this top!",
SB2.0,Beautiful top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VCPBDGIRJNS0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D91JP33L,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 29, 2022",Special Size: WomenSize: SmallColor: White-075,,Positives: This top is beautiful. The stitching is gorgeous and the material is very soft and airy. It’s a bit oversized but not in a way that looks frumpy at all. Con: the top includes a front panel to eliminate sheerness. The panel only goes halfway down which looks kind of odd. It’s noticeable when wearing the shirt. I may just remove it and wear a light tank top underneath instead. I wish the liner went the full length of the shirt. Overall it’s a beautiful quality piece!,2

The embroidery is excellent and the scalloped hem & sleeves are very pretty.  On the inside the embroidery is backed by the same material, going all the way down to where the embroidery ends.  In doing so, the embroidery is can not rub against very sensitive skin nor can there be any see-throughs.  I will definitely look for more products made by GOSIEA.Despite the fact that another blouse by this manufacturer was a perfect fit in the same size (I made an allowance for difference in measurements), this was way too snug and I only will be able to wear it after losing weight.  I purchased a size 3X as I prefer my blouses loose but normally buy size 2X which fits perfectly.",5
