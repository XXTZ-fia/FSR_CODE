However, when they arrived I tried them on and they were too tight in the crotch.  The way they were cut there was absolutely no give in the crotch.  If I tried to walk around or bend over with them on they probably would have ripped.  There was plenty of room in the seat and waist.  The legs were wide enough.  Where the legs were sewn in at the crotch there was just not enough fabric.  So with them on, every move seemed to tug at the crotch like they would rip any second.  I am a short person and often have to buy pants in a short length otherwise the legs are way too long.  Even with the pants hiked up they still felt tight in the crotch",7

We ordered two in two different sizes not being sure if they were true yo size- and will most certainly go back and order more. NOTE-they are true to size if not a bit big (which is what she liked! She is 5’7 plus inches tall (growing more what seems like every day!) and wears a size 16/18. Both pair  were big on her but she did not care. The elastic waistline has a lot of give and enabled her to still wear them. When we order again we will go down a size and give it a try. The color and design is very vibrant and the fabric really soft. A cool detail is that they took time to match the pattern as it transfers from one leg to the other which she thought was really cool feature. She has also has a lot of people compliment her and ask for the link to purchase a pair- which did wonders for her self esteem!,3
