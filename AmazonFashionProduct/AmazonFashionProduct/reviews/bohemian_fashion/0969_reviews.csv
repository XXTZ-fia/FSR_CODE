I love the pattern in the front but it doesn’t continue around across the seam, so somehow the pattern on the back is noticeably a face on my butt. I got “brown”. I like the brown. The other color contrasting with brown is sort of salmon? The fabric isn’t bad, it’s got a heathered pattern that makes it appear thinner than it is, it looks stretched to show a color from underneath, but really those are the color flecks where it is woven. It’s good for my purposes, which is an on/off/on/off sweater at school depending on where I’m at and the temp in the building, compared to if you could hang meat in my classroom that day, if I just ran up some stairs or maybe need to sit too still too long. The pockets will fit my (small) cell phone and the knit process on the reverse side of the fabric will probably snag on my rings.",
