I am 5’4” ~155 pounds, bust is 38A with disproportionately wide shoulders, short waist at 37.5” and size large is perfect in three different luvamia dresses, i think it’s safe to assume that their dress sizing is fairly consistent.  I have this particular dress in the light green and medium blue denim color (forgot the color names). The fabric is pretty sturdy, not as heavy as jeans but much more substantial than one would expect from an Amazon purchase. Dress doesn’t wrinkle too badly as long as it’s hung up or at least laid flat, right out of the dryer. If there was any shrinking, I can’t really tell.  This dress fits comfortably, and while i don’t feel that I look super dumpy in it, it’s giving me prison uniform vibes lol. The green one does not feel that way. This would look super cute on someone with a curvier shape, though there isn’t an awful lot of room for a bigger bust. I am square shaped and this dress does not hide that. That doesn’t really bother me these days, but if anyone is looking to avoid the squared up women’s correctional look, try the sleeveless button down with the frayed hem.",

The material with less cotton (Bay Blue) is lighter and more breathable; it seems to be of perfect thickness for spring. The other one with 100% cotton (hot pink) is a bit heavier, however, it may be too warm for summer days.  The color in both is vibrant and the same as the picture. In my opinion, it runs a tad large on the upper part and especially on the shoulders. I am a size 0, and XS is more of a loose fit for me, but not in a bad way. Pockets would have been an excellent addition, and the collar could have been larger. It does seem a little pricy but the quality is decent.",10
