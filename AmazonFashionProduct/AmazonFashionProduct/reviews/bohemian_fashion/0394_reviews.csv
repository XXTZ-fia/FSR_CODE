It can be layered with a long sleeve underneath, paired with a jacket, or worn alone.  I wouldn’t wear this top to workout because I sweat a lot. I need a dry fit shirt and this top is too thick (for my needs) and not the right material (again, for my needs).  I already washed the top once. It did not shrink and the color did not fade. Please note, after reading some of the other reviews about color fading and shrinking, I made sure to not dry it using high heat. I also washed it using cold water.  In terms of a crop top I didn’t want something super choppy because I usually do not show my stomach unless I am at the beach or pool. Therefore, this top, should I want to show a little skin, is perfect for my day to day in that the hem sits an inch below my ribs. *(For context I’m wearing mid-rise pants.)*  For context, I have long legs and a short torso.

I have a big butt, tiny waist, and an average-sized chest. So I like to find tops that stop at my waist to accentuate my smaller waist. And then I like to wear tops that are looser or bigger on top to add volume to my chest to balance out my big butt. That is this top. That’s why I bought more colors! 😀 I have black, white, and cream, and then I bought dark forest, Steelblue, and another white and cream 😜 I will be returning sheer blue because it is more like a green and looks like toothpaste (see pics), and I will be returning storm teal mainly because it was too dark of a color for my complexion and a little too 1980s for me. The cream is more yellow tone than the picture, but is not as yellow tone as my cream shorts that I’m wearing in the picture with it.  I’m a 34B with a 26” waist and the XS fits me great. It’s a little big on top but shrinks a little in the dryer. The bottom of the armpits do stick out just a little. But after a number of washes they didn’t poke out as much. I may take these new ones to my tailor to take them in at the armpits.",14
