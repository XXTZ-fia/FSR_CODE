It is lightweight and the fabric is a little bit stretchy. It runs small (but accurate according to the manufacturer's size guide). I normally wear a medium but bought a large based on the size guide and it fits perfectly. If you like your fit to be roomy, order 2 sizes up.  See my outfit photos - I have styled it with 1) a pair of chunky heels, hobo bag and statement earrings OR 2) elevated gold flip flops, gold bag, orange coral bead necklace and lacy gold earrings with a coral accent. I get of compliments!  Edit: I don’t like the neck tie strings at all. I just put them inside the dress and it looks fine. You can’t even tell that they’re a part of the dress. It just looks like a v-neck. Problem solved!  Happy shopping!",2
