I think the outfit is cute and I am using it again as part of my renaissance fair costume, but the quality is disappointing. The material is pretty thin and the bottom would be completely see through if it didn’t have the multiple layers. The top is slightly see through but not noticeable with a skin toned bra. I do like that the sleeves can be worn on the shoulder or off the shoulder, but they do look a little “bunched” at the top when off the shoulder.  My biggest issue with the product is the material. It cannot be put in the drier and you are only supposed to cool iron it. However the material wrinkles incredibly easily and it is hard to get the wrinkles out unless you have a steamer and lots of time.  Even though it’s thin, I did not feel like the material was breathable, and if the product was any more expensive I would have returned it.",

I like wearing the shoulders off if I’m bending my torso (seeing as the romper crotch room is null) and squaring up the neckline if I’m just walking. The back tie defines the waist and regardless of bloat the cut makes the lines beautiful and flowy.  A little girl told me I looked like a princess, which kinda made my day.",18
