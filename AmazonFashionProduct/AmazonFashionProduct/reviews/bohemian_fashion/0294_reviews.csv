The construction is a bit ""boxy;"" but it looks decent layered with a coordinating tank top and left unbuttoned, or you can use one of the shirt-tucking ""hacks."" As others have said, it does run a little big. If you like a more snug fit and plan on wearing it alone, you could probably go down one size, depending on how ""top-heavy"" you are. It washes well and doesn't wrinkle if removed from the dryer promptly. This lovely shirt will be in my regular rotation!",

I wore this shirt on the outside of my trousers (without tucking into my slacks) and it had good coverage over my full hips and backside.

It did require just a minimal bit of ironing to remove the fold lines that still showed slightly from when it was tightly vacuum-sealed when it arrived.  After ironing this shirt just one time, I expect this shirt to come out of the dryer looking good.  It is a nice quality garment and the price is good at under $25.  I recommend!",

The fabric blend isn't quite as soft as 100% cotton, but feels good against the skin (and I have sensitive skin) has a small bit of stretch, and resists wrinkles better than cotton.

It's well-made; all the seams are nicely sewn.  Note this shirt has no taper to it or princess seams, so looks like the photos on the Amazon page when tucked in, unless you intentionally gather it for a snug fit around the waist.  As advertised, the medium size has 23.6"" sleeves, which for me was just a little-bit short, but ok.  Another thing to note, the shirt comes vacuum-packed and has a slight plastic-like smell until it airs-out a bit, but after that is fine.",2

This way you can control how hot (or cold) you are by leaving the sleeves long or rolling them up as the temperature in the office is always unpredictable.  What I immediately noticed about this women's button down shirt is how the color is as stated. The blue shirt was bright and beautiful. Additionally, it was sized as fit and looked fabulous when I tried it on. The fabric is sort to the touch and the buttons are the same color as the fabric so the front looks very sharp. While I am always concerned about wrinkles, I did iron the shirt before use and the wrinkles came out easily. This shirt pairs nicely with a pair of jeans, black slacks or a colorful shirt.  The minor thing I did notice is some of the seams are not straight (down the front of the button panel) with several having two or three stitching lines as the original stitching line was broken. These were noticeable as there were left over strings along the area that I had to trim before wearing.  Overall, I liked the button down shirt and I'll be wearing it as part of my outfits. This shirt is reasonably priced and is a great basic item for any wardrobe so I'd definitely recommend it to others.",3

The shirt does appear to be well-made.  I accidentally ordered the wrong size, so I am not sure if the shirt is true to size, but I can say the XXL is two sizes above my normal size, and it is definitely pretty big on me. Based on that, I think ordering your regular size should be fine.  I machine washed and dried the shirt without any problems, and now that it has been washed, the fabric is a little less stiff.  It's still not cotton, but it is a very nice blouse overall.  The price is a little better than other long sleeve blouses available for sale, so it seems like a good value overall.",
