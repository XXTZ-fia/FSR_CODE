The size is true to what is stated, I went with a medium despite usually going up a size after reading reviews , thank you for all that reviewed. The fabric isn't scratchy but also isn't a cotton blend but helps in the way it compliments curves. Can be tied tighter or on lose side great in coverage of a belly & love handles I would think it would compliment most body styles.  Looks good dressed up or dressed down w/ pair of jeans. Hope this was some help to those trying to decide, I'm very happy with the black choice.",3

I am almost 5'5"", 128 Lbs., and 36D chest.  I ordered the medium and it couldn't be more comfortable.  Color is also spot on.  Here's a hint for wearing over the shoulder blouses:  Buy some thin elastic band (Walmart), and sew it from one side of armpit area to the other.  That way, when you slide your arm through the elastic then through the sleeve, the elastic under your arm keeps sleeve  from constantly crawling back up off shoulder.  The sleeves will rest on your shoulder, where they are supposed to be, for the duration..  Your welcome!  lol",13
