The first one i received the burgundy fit perfect so i was expecting great things. The fit was perfect and i love the color. I received the black and navy next and both fit totally different. the Black was so tight it was choking me and tight across the boob area. The navy was a little looser than the black but still tighter than the burgundy. Then i received the turquoise and it was too big! So I'm not sure what happened here but i will order another navy or black and see how it fits. Beside all that.....the burgundy one is perfect...fit and color!! i will post another review once i've ordered again.,2
