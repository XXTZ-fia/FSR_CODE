I'm a pear shape, and they're a perfect shape for me - fitted nicely at the top, and flared/a-line lower down. These tunics hang really well, and are not just bag and baggy, like some flared tunics. They flare well to give a nice shape. The print choices are lovely, and the quality is fantastic for the price, really well made. I love the feel of it very comfortable and fit of the sleeves and neckline are flattering. These XPSJBBB tunics really feel like a more expensive top.",5
