So now the sleeves look even more weird with one wide and one narrow because of the broken elastic. This shirt is super cute and the material is so soft. I got a large and the sleeves we just barely long enough. However, after the 1st wash the material on the front of the sleeve shrunk significantly leaving the front of the sleeve several inches too short, but the material on the back of the sleeve did not shrink making the sleeves lay weird now. I washed it exactly as the instructions said and did not put it in the dryer. Super disappointed because this shirt is absolutely adorable.",

The main body of the top is fine. The sleeves are not nearly long enough (the picture shows them to almost sit on your wrist). The sleeves come way up on my arm- like 3/4 length sleeves. I have average length arms. I ended up just pushing them up my arm. Probably would not buy this style sleeve top again. NOTE the top description says 'lace short sleeve'. But the top itself and what the model is wearing is long sleeve and not lace.,3
