I don’t usually like the keyhole sleeves, but these actually looked just fine. The colors were very nice and the fabric was light-weight and not at all see through.  I did go a size up, and I’m glad I did. It probably would have still fit, but in this heat I wanted as little touching me as possible!

Note* From the original order date to delivery date was quite a long time, so plan accordingly if ordering for a specific date or occasion. Thie print has good color saturation. It does not wrinkle easily. The fit is snug in the sleeves, but not intolerable. It fits tighter around the chest than hip area. Around the hips the fabric glides easily and is a comfortable, easy drape. Around the bust, it is tight enough to pucker a little. That could have some to do with the sleeves? Petite sizes, excpect a couple of inches below the knee in length. It has pockets! Great! Sometimes it looks like the side pockets stick out a little and I havent decided if that’s an issue. I believe other reviews mentioned this. If I find it unacceptable, I will sew one of the pockets shut to give it a straighter line on one side and keep the pocket on only one side. Overall, I like the dress.",6

So I decided to buy 2 more for the summer - bought another black one since the first one was fading due to normal wash & wear - also bought a printed (green palm print). The material they are using now is not the same - it's thinner with less stretch, it feels like an uncomfortable stiff shirt that you want to stretch out, but it just doesnt.
