White seems to be the thinnest and can take a little drying in the dryer. Black seems to be a tad thicker material and I’d order up a size (worse case,wash and dry a little ant they will fit,don’t dry more that 10-15 minutes) They are cotton,not linen,the get softer with more cold washes. Bottom line,BUY By your waist measurement,hips will fit as they are loose fit,but be honest with your waist size and go with the wider waist size.Extremely comfortable and flowy cool.If it says waist is 28-36,go up a size.As I said earlier,they will dry smaller if needed,they won’t dry bigger.Hang dry (which takes no time at all) I washed in cold.The black seems to loose length if you dry at all in dryer.I wore a medium in the colors I purchased,but the black pair was better as a large.Im 5’7 155,40 inch hips,honest waist (😵‍💫) where these sit…..35 inches,so the medium is fine (except black) in cold water and the air dry setting on the dryer or I hang mine for less that an evening.I live in Hawaii,getting older so was looking for something “easy/breezy/cool and these are great to cover up more and still be cool and stylish. UPDATE: The white seems to dry and retain its flowy size (so medium would fit as opposed to black which didn’t) the colors are better to either use the “air dry” option on your dryer or hang dry.They are worth the extra effort,which really isn’t much.Wash in cold water.No dryer heat. Just a very comfortable pant for warm weather or just lounging around.Ive kept the majority of what I’ve purchased……they are that comfortable.",98
