I purchased this t-shirt with a different print a few weeks back and loved it so much I bought a few as gifts. It felt like a candid camera moment. There is no WAY this company should be allowed to sell what they sent me. The first t-shirt was perfect. The next ones....there are not quite words for how terrible the quality was. It felt like a joke, and the fact that I now have to spend even another minute of my life dealing with this shirt is beyond me. The first one took two days to arrive. The next was three weeks. And it came from China Post/USPS, made of some type of nylon and looks like a bad Halloween costume. Do not order from here until they fix this issue with the supplier. You have been WARNED!  ORIGINAL REVIEW - I will be buying more of these. Favorite t-shirt and I do not want to take it off. So soft and comfy, very cute and the print is really soft and nicely made. I would say this is more of a dark grey color versus worn black. Also, size up if you want oversized. The length is perfect, I ordered an XL because I wanted it to be large and it was not too long. Baggy which I loved! I am 5'5, 115lbs and it's exactly what I had in mind.",11
