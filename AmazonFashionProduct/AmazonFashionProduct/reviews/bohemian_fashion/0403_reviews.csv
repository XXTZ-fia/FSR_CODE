The material is light and airy but double-lined, which is fantastic for coverage. However, at 6ft tall, this dress is very short on me, so I have to be a bit cautious when wearing it. One detail I didn’t expect is the front tie with a keyhole opening. I usually prefer more modest styles, but I found a way to adjust it to make it work for me. Overall, it’s a beautiful dress, and despite its quirks, I’m really happy with it!",

Amber,Color of actual dress different than photo,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JK7VI3YHG1WL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BB5K76S8,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 25, 2024",Size: MediumColor: 4 Blue,Verified Purchase,I ordered the powder blue with the light tan flowers. I got a powdered blue dress with dark rust colored flowered. I thought it was maybe the screen showing a different color but after looking through the customer photos it looks like it’s just the luck of the draw because some have light tan flowers and others have the rust color. I wasn’t a fan of the rust color flowers so I returned and ordered the black which I love. I’m usually a M or L and after trying on the powder blue it looked kind of baggy in the shoulder area and the dress has great stretch so I ended up getting the small in black which fits great! I gave it 3 stars because I do love the black dress. Took off two for inaccurate photo and hassle of having to returning item because of that.,

Although the recommended size for me was a large, I decided to go with the medium, and I’m glad I did because the cut on the back of the dress fit me better with the medium, although the length of the large would have been more appropriate. I’m keeping the medium and absolutely look forward to wearing it on my upcoming cruise! Note:it stops above my knee 2-3 inches. Height 5’ 8” Weight: 171 lbs",10
