I wound up with 6: this hot pink; a dark blue Hawaiian print; solid light blue; light blue with pink and white floral; green vintage peach floral; and a navy with a sage, pink, and white botanical print.  Even though the style is the same, the different prints have totally different vibes. Pockets are a big bonus. They are fun to accessorize and go with bedazzled flip flops, simple sandals or ballet slippers.  I led several gatherings this year and wore these dresses most of the days and got many, many compliments.  They are a lightweight blend of rayon and cotton and if they get wet they pucker similar to seer sucker. I prefer my dresses smooth which takes just 2 minutes with a steamer.  The fabric is flowy and comfortable even on humid days and the long length can hide a multitude of issues - like bandages, scars, or knee braces.  I really like that I can be dressed up and ready for a dinner date just by stepping out of jeans and dropping one of these pretty dresses over my head. No fuss, all glam.  I spent way too many hours trying to decide which ONE I wanted. So I got my favorites and enjoyed looking pretty the rest of the summer. Will probably add a few next summer if they're still available.",2

The color was soft green the print was not over done. It's a dress that would fit a young and slimmer frame as nicely as it felt on my 82+ year body. The bodice doesn't make it look like a maternity dress. Yet the straight fall from the bodice line could hide the curves you don't want showing. The ankle length allowed for some dressy sandles, a simple summer light gold straw purse. This dress can be dressed.up or semi dressy as mine looked. I really want to buy more of this style.
