When I received them, they came running pretty small, and were terrible quality.",
Jj ll,Color leaked and shape of shorts was not for me,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XUX8FZ4LJAZH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRFPNHN,"2.0 "," the United States "," July 30, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Aqua,Verified Purchase,"I bought these for a music festival, i’m very glad i tested them out before because a very small amount of water caused them to leak blueish dye onto my skin and the shorts were much longer than pictured. the pattern was also not the exact same- might as well buy on shein",
Stephanie,Comfortable but shredded on first wear,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RZ06SIQVABXH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRFPNHN,"1.0 "," the United States "," July 20, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Aqua,,"I bought these because they seemed very lightweight and breathable and also cute. Which they definitely are. I was impressed with how cute they were and i loved the colors and the patterns. However, I packed them to wear on a vacation and within a couple hours of wearing/walking in them the entire inseam of the pants fell apart and shredded. The material is very thin and comfortable but i was very disappointed that the fabric was so fragile. I definitely can't recommend these if you are going to do anything except sit completely still in them. You may need a massive thigh gap in these to be able to walk in them. Not sure how well they would have held up in the washing machine after that either.",
Dante,Ripped on first wear,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BVN1YOX3EIQL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRFPNHN,"1.0 "," the United States "," May 10, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Turquoise,Verified Purchase,"The shorts look great, and the material is very thin. I thought it would be nice and breathable- but I squatted down once and it ripped like tissue paper. If you don’t plan on moving at all, these are the shorts for you.",5
Mackensi Higlin,Great but shape of shorts are off,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GNDVFCVPH25S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRFPNHN,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 6, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Turquoise,Verified Purchase,"I love these shorts but the inner part of the shorts are shorter then the outside, making it seem like your thighs eat the shorts - I ordered the pink one as well and the shorts did not have this issue.",
Mackensi Higlin,Perfect - just like the photo,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PCQXQMCIVX1H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRFPNHN,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 6, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Light Pink,Verified Purchase,These shorts look just like the photo and are a high quality.,
Terra L,Cute shorts but I don't care for gold accents.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJR3930HFJBA1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRFPNHN,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 26, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,I thought they would be all black & white patterns but mine had some gold foil print accents that made them look cheapish. I haven't washed them yet but will definitely  hand wash in cold since the colors may run. I kept them because they are unique & got them for under $20. Waist band is elastic & tight but will loosen up with wear.,2
Vikki,Exactly as described,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JPIHI08TSGMW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRFPNHN,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 9, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Parrot Green,Verified Purchase,"Comfy.

brian chuchmucker,perfect lounge shorts,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VOH7CAXCKARZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRFPNHN,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 3, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Light Pink,Verified Purchase,Absolutely love love love these shorts. Originally out of the package they were a little stiff and weird shaped but then washed and they lay perfectly. Only complaint is the pockets (while super roomy) are in a weird place on the front. Other than that they got delivered fast and are super comfy and soft.,

BH,Took a Chance,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RT04S6S5NLOTK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRFPNHN,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 18, 2023",Size: One SizeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"I took a chance on these shorts, and I'm glad I did.  I am very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the craftsmanship (made in India), the sizing and the colors.  It's amazing that these shorts are actually pieced work, different rayon fabrics sewn together (thus the threads -easily clipped- that some reviewers commented on).  The size range is comfortable for small to medium (size 2-8), with adequate fabric for a loose fit and large (10-12) if you don't mind a tight elastic waist. The colors and fabrics do not exactly match the photos, but the ""general"" color is what you get.  I got ""white"" (has lots of red flowers) and ""pink"" (which has more oranges).  As long as you realize they are individually hand sewn, you won't be disappointed with the color variations.",10

There is only one pocket sewn into the pants, as well as the delivery taking almost 2 weeks. there was no contact from Amazon about delayed delivery until the day after, it was supposed to be delivered, so that was very irritating. And then the estimated date of delivery changed to the three days after the original delivery date and it still didn’t come until five days after the new updated delivery date",5
KC Mom,Very cute!

They don’t look exactly like the picture but it gives a little touch. It feels like all the little squares are individually sewn on unlike some other patchwork items on here. They have pockets that are actually deep! And the drawstring is different from the shorts which I think is so cute.",10
