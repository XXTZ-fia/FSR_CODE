A large just fits my shoulders and arms and I'm not a particularly big woman. Also, it's not very flattering on me. The black is a lot better than the grey. They just don't flow nicely.  A belt doesn't help nor does a clip holding the front together. I haven't washed them yet so maybe the material will look better after a wash as they are wrinkled from shipping. I'm not putting it in the dryer because I can't risk shrinking it. Notice the model has her hands in her pockets? That's the only way the grey one looks half way decent on me. I might just use this as a robe if it doesn't improve after a wash.",2
