The material doesn't have much give/stretch but in the waist. I'm about 275 lbs and 5'5 with a big butt and hips and smaller waist. I ordered the 3x, and I can usually fit between a 2x-3x in most clothing. I can fit the shorts but I can tell they would rip or tear easy. Ordered outfit for a trip, thinking about reordering the 4x but may just return. The top fit pretty good though, and covered the tiny shorts and big butt good. Love that the tiny shorts have pockets that you can actually put your hands in too. Very breathable and light weight.",
