I wear them 5 days out of the week. The straps get all twisted and then adventually they break. The little adjustable clips on the straps break too. It's sad because I really really love these dresses! I'm a hot person so the light weight material. It flows and feels like wearing nothing! Maybe because the material is so light that's why the straps break. The sizing is nice too and true to size.,

Ginnilee,Beautifully Comfortable!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTGUJ1B21HUQK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWTVK5FX,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 21, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Floral 08,Verified Purchase,"I LOVE this dress! I have 2 of them right now and hope to purchase more. The comfort level out of 10 is 100! If I could give it stars simply for comfort I would give it 100. The material is quite nice, light and airy but still sturdy and well made. No loose threads of bad hems. No crooked seams or uneven straps etc.. Very nicely done. The cons though are still worth knowing. First off the colors can be deceiving. It does not always look like the color on the screen. I have sent 2 of them back because of that. Also the quality control may be slightly less than, I ordered one in the same size as the other 2 that I already have and it was obviously to small. It had the correct size on the Tag, but I believe that someone had ordered that one previously and then washed it (or dried it) incorrectly (these are cold wash, HANG dry) and it shrunk so they sent it back! These do wash very well, I have washed them several times in my machine on COLD wash. Then hang them to dry and they are like new! But once, my husband accidently put one in the dryer and it shrank just as they said it would. I managed to stretch it out enough in the bust area to make it wearable again but it will always be about an inch or so shorter than the other one. So, as long as you are willing to abide by the laundering rules (or if you are skinny enough that you don't care) and you are willing to take a chance on some possible small differences in color, then YES, buy this dress! I love mine as I have stated before and I will be buying more. The cool thing too is that as the weather gets cooler you can wear a t-shirt or long sleeve top underneath this dress and it looks really cute and feels great.",

Ironed it nowhere near where the straps are sewn in at the back and when I took it off the board to hang, a strap broke. I had just finished sewing it back on when the other one came loose and fell out. What I noticed is my other ones have multiple layers of thread weaving in and out but this newest one just had a single, very thin thread looped over once that wasn't tied or anything. The end of the thread was just tucked up the single strand and sticking out. But again, I LOVE these dresses. Perfect for summer with a belt or beginning of fall with a cardigan.
