I also didn't care for the elastic at the wrists of the sleeves, because after a long day of work those tend to hurt, and I get tired of adjusting them all day. My final complaint is that the inner lining of the V area of the neck tends to pop out sometimes, and it was annoying having to push it back in.

It's thick and has a bit of a texture to it, adding interest to an otherwise fairly basic, nondescript blousy top.
