Entropic Variable,Not for My Rectangle/Hourglass Figure,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPRX8I7U22FFQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B3M471N7,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 29, 2024",Color: Purple Long Sleeve ShirtsSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I’m 5’7” & 125 lbs. Bust/Waist/Hips: 37”/29”/36”. Which puts me between a Rectangle and Hourglass figure type, so garments that are fitted to and accentuate my natural waist are always the most flattering on me.  I most often wear a medium and the Amazon algorithm recommended a medium, so that’s what I tried. The shoulders and sleeves fit me well, the neckline was cute, the bodice was comfortable and flattering for my B/C bust, and the length hit just below my booty and crotch which would have made this perfect for pairing with leggings.  Unfortunately the transition from smocking to peplum on the bodice falls about 3” ABOVE my natural waist and lays squarely on my ribcage. The overall effect in my case is to dramatically widen the appearance of my midsection and figure overall, which is the absolute least flattering thing any garment can do for my body type. If the transition fell at my natural waistline this would be a perfect cut top for me and I'd buy it in multiple colors.  I’m guessing that this would probably work best for women with very short torsos, or Apple/Round/Oval or Pear/Triangle or Spoon or Diamond figure types. Or maybe as early gestation maternity wear.  The purple that I ordered was very pretty and was as shown in the Amazon image, and I was impressed with the overall quality of the piece for the cost. But since it absolutely didn’t work for my figure, I had to return it.",12

The fabric feels like a high quality pima cotton, even though it is a synthetic blend. Be aware, the model in the product photos is quite flat chested, so it might not be obvious that the smocked area will fit snugly. Despite the snug fit, the shirt is still flattering on me, and if I had sized up, I think the lower half of the shirt would have been too loose.  I am very happy with how it fits along the neckline. Thanks to the smocked fit, I can lean forward without showing any cleavage or showing my bra strap. I also like that I can push up the smocked sleeves to wash my hands, etc. and they will stay put (although I don't think it would be very comfortable to leave the sleeves pushed up all day).
