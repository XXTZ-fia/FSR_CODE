So okay, I have had a few pairs of these “soft, boho pattern flare pants” throughout my young life. I remember when they peaked back in early 2010s! So, if you see my photos, I already owned a few pairs in Red/Pink and Black/White. These pants are my favorite. They are so soft, such good quality. They feel like cotton, they’re pretty thick (and don’t show panty lines!), and they’re the perfect length on my 5’7 self, they are truly the best.  I really wanted some in Blue, but I couldn’t find any in my area. So I decided to give Amazon a shot. I’m a bit disappointed. You may not be able to tell from my photos, but these pants are… different. The pattern is clearly laser printed. It doesn’t look as ‘real’ as the red and black ones. Also, the quality is much worse. It doesn’t feel like soft cotton, it feels more like polyester. The pattern does look good, but it’s just not the same. The fit is fine, but it’s more lightweight than my genuine boho pants. It’s also more see through!?! That’s not supposed to happen, IMO. Overall, they’re thinner, not as soft, and really cheaply made.  But still, If you’re just going for a boho look, then go for it. I’d say, if you can, try to find the real deal boho flares in discount department stores.",2

There was no way to tell which side was front or back. I am 120 pounds athletic build and long legs. There was a lot of loose material in the front but form fitting on the butt. The length was good but my legs are long so they were a couple inches shorter than I would prefer. I also did not like the material, it's sort of shiny microfiber type of blend. The pattern and colors are very cute, though.",3
