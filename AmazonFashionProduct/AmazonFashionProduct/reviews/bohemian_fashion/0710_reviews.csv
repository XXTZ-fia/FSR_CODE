Leo Leonard,Absolutely stunning! Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R355HN2SOSEH07/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07WGBKRQH,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 12, 2017",Size: X-LargeColor: Magenta/Navyblue,Verified Purchase,"I am in love with this dress. It's gorgeous and flattering, and when I wear it I can't take 5 steps without someone stopping me to tell me how much they love it. I was worried about the sizing because I'm short and curvy, but I ordered a 4x and hoped for the best. I am so glad I did! The wrap style is super forgiving and does a good job of hiding a bit of a post c-section pooch. I'm a triple-d and never expected to be able to wrap the top all the way over my chest, but it still looks perfect open in the front over a cami, and adding a wide belt is the final perfect touch. Unlike the vast majority of these types of dresses, that tend to be made in Asian sizes and run far smaller than we hope, the upper arms of this dress are actually surprisingly roomy without being frumpy or matronly. That has been a constant source of frustration for me and a lot of other women who take a gamble on these dresses and tops; 9 times out of 10 when you finally find one that fits well everywhere else, it will still be ridiculously tight in the arms. But not this dress! And there is enough material in the skirt for both sides to reach the opposite hip; since I already can't close the top I'm going to try another pattern in a 3x. There are some other colors/patterns that I like that aren't available in the 4x, so I'm going to try a smaller one and see how it works. When I do, I'll update this review and include pictures of both.  The one thing that isn't ideal is how long this is; it puddles up on the ground when I'm barefoot or in flats, but a pair of high heeled boots fixed that right up. I'm 5'3"" tall and the boots have a 2 1/2 inch heel, and the skirt brushed the tops of the toes. Be warned though: I'm well endowed on top and also have a legendary ghetto booty. That helps to hold the dress up another inch or two. But please trust me when I tell you how gorgeous this dress is, and for the price it's absolutely worth it if you need to hem it or twist it once under a belt.  A final warning: not all of the dresses shown here are the same. I'm reviewing the dusky purple dress with long bell sleeves. All of the dresses with those sleeves are the same, size-wise. But the ones with short sleeves are TINY. I'm talking size 0 tiny. Like doll clothes. So be careful which color you order! If you get the right dress I know you'll love it as much as I do. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!",14
mia calarese,Completely. OBSESSED.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D2YQDJI4VY3P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07WGBKRQH,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 9, 2022",Size: LargeColor: Magenta/Navyblue,Verified Purchase,"This dress was everything I was hoping for. It is so flattering. I feel so beautiful in it. I am 5’3, And wear between a size 12 and 14. I wear a 38 DD bra. I will have to wear a tank top just for the bust area. It fits so perfectly everywhere else but is too revealing of my bra, and it was too tight to pin it closed. But I am busty so that’s kind of to be expected in a dress with no stretch, especially when it fits in the waist. But that’s why I love this dress so much. There is no stretch. It lays very flat, and it doesn’t cling to my mom belly. It’s not transparent at all. I read some reviews where it said it was completely see-through, and I am so grateful to say that mine is completely solid and there is no transparency whatsoever. The length is perfect, you could wear it with a short wedge, but I’m going to wear it with flat sandals, because it hits just at the floor maybe a half inch above. I like my dresses long, and this is perfect because it’s not dragging on the ground.  I bought it to wear to a wedding in Georgia in early May. It is just perfect. I have a lot of tattoos that I wanted to cover and this is romantic, feminine, flattering, and it covers everything without it looking like I’m trying to cover everything. If I could give this dress more than five stars I would. I am so glad that my search for the perfect dress for this wedding is over. I can see myself wearing this on dinner dates for years to come. Extremely happy with this purchase.",35
YO!,Perfect Maxi Dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17R86DMP9UQ9D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07WGBKRQH,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 21, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"~5’5”/145lbs LOVE thIs true “Maxi” dress to wear to a 70’s birthday party.

Mary,Love the dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YSWPSDD4GVAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07WGBKRQH,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 5, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"This seller has really nice maxi dresses, hope they keep carrying more of these styles. Ok, this dress is true to size. I’m 38B on top, 5’3 in height and I weigh 140 pounds. The dress goes down to your feet but not to the floor. The dress flows nicely, non transparent in this blue turquoise print, fabric is light and it’s not stretchy. If your 36/38 around the bust area, go with the large. Always go with your bust size when it’s a wrap dress because it determines the weith of your back and if the fabric is not stretchy, you won’t get away with a medium. I have a tiny waist and that part of any dress is always adjustable. It’s your back, chest and shoulders that determine your correct fit. So anyone 36 to 38 is a large. 39 to40 XL and 34 to 36 a medium and a small anywhere bellow is a small. If you don’t have a flat stomach, keep in mind you will have less fabric to wrap around you and your slit will be more open, but it will still look nice and sexy. You can dress up or dress down this dress. It’s beautiful and I received many compliments. Hope this information helped.",40
Holisticmom,Sewing Flaw or for Busty women only?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UFECG1HO4GTT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07WGBKRQH,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 9, 2019",Size: SmallColor: Multicolor-blue,Verified Purchase,"The dress overall is really nice and it fit everywhere except the bust area.  It was simply way too big!  I ordered a small, but there was no tag on the inside to see if they sent the right size.  I believe it was a small as it fit everywhere else and any smaller, it would be too tight on my shoulders.  Not sure if this is just a flaw with this particular dress, because from the reviews and the pics from others who have purchased it, it appears you don't have to have large breasts to wear this.  Don't normally have issues with the chest area with wrap dresses and I thought I would be able to simply adjust and tighten the wrap, but nothing worked.  In fact it seems like if the hole was in a different location, I would be able to adjust it.  So I'm wondering if this is a flaw in this dress, particularly because there was no tag on the inside and the dress arrived earlier than the delivery dates given.  Very disappointed because I love the dress and it looked really awesome on everyone I saw it on....both small and large busted.  Now I must wait 48hrs to see if the seller will ""approve"" a return.  Not happy about that at all and wish I had known that before ordering.  Should not have to wait for a seller's ""approval"" if something doesn't fit!  Will think twice before ordering from this seller again.",4

A complete wrinkled MESS like someone else’s return that no one bothered to actually return it in the nice clean zip envelope that all my other 4 dresses from which were folded beautifully to the extent that I was able to wear the white/blue without pressing or steaming… I will keep it and spend the at least 30min ironing it because I actually do love the style and print.

Elizabeth Johnson,Lovely wrap around dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MVDB0J0X89A1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07WGBKRQH,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 4, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I love this dress. It is made of a lightweight material, it fits correctly and lays well, and u think it is quite complimentary. The one drawback for me is that the length of the wrap around belt is too short! It is possible to wrap it around as it should, but only leaves several inches of length to secure the belt, not enough for a nice bow. I will work around this as I love the dress, but it’s a simple mistake that u hope they remedy.",2
Balania,So. Many. Compliments.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15QNKEOEEY59Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07WGBKRQH,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 18, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Lots & lots of compliments on this one, and I wear dresses often enough, so it’s not just the novelty of wearing a dress that’s earning the nods.. it’s the dress itself.  I did change a few things: 1) I hand-sewed the lower, open front closed from just below the waist, and downward. (Super easy). Now I step into it & still wrap with the ties. I’m not comfortable with a possibly-open front or tall “slit”, plus I was going to be on a high stage for one event, so I don’t need people staring up the dress. 2) I wear a cami under it, because otherwise it would plunge quite low. I’ve done navy or white, but the white looks best. I may permanently sew in a white mock-camisole (again, super easy for the non-sewer… I kinda make it up as I go) 3) I’m not a fan of the flare sleeves. They just get in my way. So far I haven’t changed them, and it’s been ok. But I plan to get rid of the flares… perhaps convert into a long sleeved ballon sleeve. I might have to get help figuring that out.  Washing is easy in washer or by hand. Don’t put it in the dryer. The rayon will shrink. But the nice thing about the rayon: it makes for an easy travel dress. Stuff it in your bag (takes up little space), pull it out, hang, spray with some water. Then either let it hang overnight or give the damp dress a few straightening rugs & the wrinkles come out easily, then dry quickly.  Very lightweight & breezy. Fun when the wind catches it a little. The lightweight-ness and ease of getting rid of wrinkles are the positives, if the trade off is a fabric made of plastic (rayon). But honestly, nothing else is as breezy as rayon. Sigh. So one smash-hit in my closet will be ok.  Really like the colors & pattern. A little boho style, but it really seems to work with most people. Favorite dress in about 5 years!",3
mitzel carrera,"Ajuste perfecto, gran funcionalidad para un vestido sexy!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ECB39EOMA792/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07WGBKRQH,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 8, 2020",Size: SmallColor: Multicolor-blue,Verified Purchase,"Quiero explicar porque escogí este vestido-kimono dentro de tantos que hay en Amazon: buscaba un Kimono principalmente para usar en la playa, largo hasta el piso (sin que arrastrara) de mangas largas pero que no fueran estilo murcielago, de una tela liviana, fresca y con un estampado en tonos azules que no fuera escandaloso, fácil del combinar. No quería algo muy costoso, pues basándome en que los kimonos son prendas de construcción bastante sencilla, suelen quedar sueltos, anchos y que el objetivo principal es la playa pues no estaba dispuesta a pagar mucho dinero. Y si además era lo bastante bonito como para usar de forma casual sobre ropa como un short o incluso un jeans, estaría perfecto para mi. Pues este Kimono-vestido de Amazón es todas esas cosas, las cumple a la perfección. Una vez lo tuve en mi mano y me lo probé, comprobé que es perfecto, porque además queda muy bien, realmente se ve muy bonito, esta funcionalidad adicional que tiene de poder usarlo como un vestido de verano es un gran plus para mí. En cuanto al producto en sí, el patrón de la tela es muy bonito. Está bien cocido, sin embargo no está bien rematado, los lugares en las costuras donde suele haber más tensión les hace falta un buen remate para evitar que las costuras se deshagan. Y hay algo que deseo aclarar: este es un producto “económico” si estás buscando calidad en los detalles este no es el producto para ti y te explico porque: 1. El final de las mangas no tiene un dobladillo, tiene una costura de overlook, que puede parecer un poco rústica. Esto es igual para el borde del vestido (ver fotos anexas). 2. El vestido tiene un corte, en donde hay una unión de la tela que no es simétrico (ver fotos anexas) 3. El patrón del estampado puede verse un poco torcido en la parte superior de la espalda (foto) y en la parte de abajo por detras del vestido en donde esta la unión de las dos piezas (fotos). Para mi sigue siendo un buen producto que cumple con lo que yo estaba buscando, a pesar de esos detalles se ve muy bien (es por eso que no lo doy 5 estrellas), realmente no son detalles que hagan ver la pieza mal. Ademas el ajuste es perfecto, yo soy talla S, tengo de busto 34C y mido 1,59 mts y me quedo perfecto, el largo de las mangas y el ancho es perfecto, el escote queda ideal, igualmente el largo del vestido es el apropiado, es largo hasta el piso sin arrastrarse y la abertura enfrente hace ver un poco las piernas sin mostrar demasiado y eso hace lucir muy sexy… Por ultimo puedo decir que el proveedor en China fue muy amable. Me vi en la necesidad de contactarlo porque el pedido quedo retenido en China justo cuando declararon la emergencia mundial por el Covid y me indicó que el producto llegaría sin problema una vez que abrieran los aeropuertos y así fue.",17

It's the purple/gray one, but the color is less purple and more hot pinkish...like most of the Amazon item pics. Regarding modesty, I don't at all like showing my cleavage, so I wore a tank underneath. Also, when I sat down, my legs (from the ankle...all the way up) were on FULL display, so I found myself manually covering them with one side of the dress. What I don't like is the sleeve length. I LOVE the sleeve length depicted in their picture, but the model in the pic must be short or have short arms, because my sleeves hit just above my wrists. :( I'd definitely prefer longer sleeves, but I'm keeping the dress.  3yr UPDATE (pic w/boots): I now weigh 149 lbs & wore this dress today. I received multiple compliments about how pretty my dress is. The waist was swimming on me, so I wrapped the sash to my back, then tied it at my side… that made the waist display a great fit; the right belt would’ve worked too.

It is SUCH a great quality dress for $20! I went up in a size due to the fact it was made in China, I probably could have just stuck with a large (I ordered an XL). So yes, it’s a tad big because I ordered a size up, but it is definitely true to size... but there is nothing wrong with a little extra room.  The colors, are beautiful. I ordered the grey & purple. I am so excited to wear this. I am 5’7, and it does not drag on the ground but ends right near my ankles... it’s cut so it is like that, so you do not look like you’re “ready for the flood”. The material isn’t heavy, but it’s not extremely light either like something you would expect ordered off of amazon from a clothing brand you’ve never heard of. I definitely would not dry this in a drier.  It came packaged in a thick zip loc bag, which was nice... it wasn’t just thrown in cheap plastic.  Also for those of you that don’t know, it’s a wrap dress, so it has to wrap around you (duh). It probably could be worn open too, if you had a cute outfit to go under it.  Just order it.

I usually wear a size 4, with a bigger bottom than the top and have gotten one of these in a medium, and on accident, I got one in a large.  Both work; its a wrap dress.  I will say that the medium did seem to shrink a little bit in the wash, the top part is fine for me (I am a B cup), the bottom is fine too, but the overlap on the legs open a little when I sit and cross my legs, which is common for a wrap.  The large leaves a lot of extra fabric.  All of this is to say if you are unsure about what size to get, size up.  Also, the bluish pasley one comes with long bell sleeves which are nice, as long as you are not trying to cook or do anything productive in the dress.",5

(5’4”, 145 lbs). It’s a wrap dress and it hangs weird in the chest when I wear it wrapped up. I probably should’ve ordered a large/extra large, HOWEVER, I typically wear it as a kimono, hanging open, with the waist ties tied into loose individual bows, and I have honestly never once worn it without receiving MULTIPLE compliments. One day I wore it to the mall and had people literally shout compliments as I walked around. The print is screened on, so this isn’t an intricate detail situation, but it’s cute and flowy and for the price? A great addition to any bohemian wardrobe. This was the only pic I could find of me in it - not the greatest, but you can see the print well here. Get it! And wear it as a dress or a wrap. Then go walk around your local mall & are what happens. (Seriously, guys. We need to support our malls. They’re dying at breakneck speeds.)",16

The neckline is low and the front will open up as you walk or sit. If you plan to wear this with just undies, you might be exposing more than you want! That said, the garment is beautiful. I love the colors (I chose the Lake Blue) and the sleeves are fabulous! I hand washed it and put it in the dryer with another load that was 1/2 way dry.

I couldn't tie the straps on the blue dress while they were wrapped around my waste all the way around, but the purple one I could easily tie and had extra length. Seems a bit inconsistent as far as sizing but otherwise it was just gorgeous and I didn't think the fabric was a bad quality. I may re order the blue dress again and see if I can get lucky with longer straps. I ordered the XL 16/18 and I am a 32H up top. I can see how this dress might not work for someone with a larger rib cage especially if the straps are short. But it is worth a try. I am 5'9"" and the dress hit about at my ankles.

Love the boho styling, but I'm going to have to return the Free Size/Small that I ordered and try the Large, since I don't see an option for Medium.  I am 5'5, 127, 36D, and normally wear a size Small or 6-8 dress, size 4-6 jeans.  The size Small in this dress was the perfect length for me--- might be a tad too long to wear with flat sandals, but perfect for a low or medium heel.  However the sleeves were a tad on the short side, and although the dress did (barely) fit around my back and cover my chest, the material (which has no stretch) gaped open in an odd way at the cleavage area.  I could have my seamstress fix that, or even use a tiny safety pin, but the Small seemed skimpy on the width of the dress too!... there was barely enough fabric for it to wrap all the way around!  So I just have a feeling I'll be happier with a larger size, which I can have altered to fit if need be.  It's such a sensational dress at such a good price, that I don't mind the trouble.  Husband loved it too.",5

I could only tie it in the back, not all the way around in the front.  Otherwise, the fabric was cute with a retro feel (I chose the “lake blue” option).  This dress is more like a robe, with ribbons attached to each side of the front panels.  The dress closes like a wrap, with the iside ribbon going through a hole on the opposite side of the dress to emerge and tie with the other ribbon.  Overall it feels like something summery you could wear to the beach.  Because it’s a wrap, the slit at the leg goes all the way up, and you have to be careful not to show too much leg!  I also found the length to be great for my height, so I’m not sure it won’t be a little long on shorter women.",2

It's perfect for summer. I knew it was sheer thus why I purchased it. 2 things though, for why I only chose 4 out of 5 stars. 1, the dress is not as dark as I was hoping for, which is expected from looking at a photo on the internet versus the real thing. I was hoping for a deep royal purple but instead it was more of a fade purple. Second, I normally wear a L/XL, and reading through reviews everyone said 4x. It's actually a bit big. If you're into an extra flow then all is good, I also purchased a belt as shown in the picture which really helped with that and helped with the length. It is a bit lengthy and I'm 5'7"", bunching it up with a waste belt really helps though. All in all the fabric is breathable and comfortable, the price is great for a maxi dress, and it's still gorgeous. I want to buy more now lol.",

I’m a medium/large in dresses, 5’6” average woman build size 10/12 depending on brand, so I ordered the Large, and it was a smidge small. It wraps all the way around but not enough to keep it decent if the wind blows, and spreads when I sit, so I had to find a way to pull the dress over my thighs to cover the goods. Would recommend wearing shorts underneath, especially if going outside. Very thin comfy fabric, some loose strings but just look like they were missed in finishing touches, not necessarily a problem. All in all worth the money, but won’t be buying other colors unless I lose about 15 pounds (which should put me in a medium but would be a large in this dress). Still wish it was purple",3

It layer really nicely. There’s a stray thread or two but it doesn’t seem like anything major and still well worth it for the price.

Ordered Sunday, delivered Monday and not even advertised as one day shipping. 👍🏻  Neutral- *The blue color is lighter in person and the turquoise stands out more than in the picture. Just FYI.  Cons- *The stitching isn't the greatest. There are lots of strings hanging out of seams. *This isn't made for short people. I'm 5'3"" and I need to hem it by 5.5"" so it doesn't completely drag on the ground. *You're not going to see any leg unless you really try hard and it doesn't tie in the front. If you have a small waist you can tie it in the back (which I think looks better) but you're supposed to tie the bow on the side. *The boob part is weird too.

You insert one end of the belt through a loophole on the side of the dress and then wrap the dress around to the side.

I love this dress, I wouldn't be afraid to get it again or another color in another 3xl, thinking sizing might just not be consistent in manufacturing and may end up with a better fit.

Im 5'6 and i wouldn't be able to wear this dress with flats as it touches the ground so I wear it with a pair of wedges. Im glad i took the chance and ordered!!",228
