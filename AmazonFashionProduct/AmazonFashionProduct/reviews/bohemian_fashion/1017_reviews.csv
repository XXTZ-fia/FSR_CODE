The material is thin and loose making it breathable and comfortable. The solid black color goes with everything. While I don’t typically wear Rayon I could layer this multiple times making it a great value for the money.,

They are suuuuper cute! They’re also incredibly comfy, and would work well on a wide variety of body types and sizes.  However there are a few things I dislike about them! The material is very very thin; for both the sake of warmth and modesty (I feel like in direct sun you’d see right thru them), I wear leggings under them. The material also wrinkles really easily. I took the time to iron them out, then took a 5 mile cat ride and by the time I arrived they were full of deep creases all over again. And worry that the unfinished edges on the inside of the pockets will fray.  I doubt these will hold up over the long term, which is disappointing because they definitely look great on me!",

Apparently, the style originated  in Thailand.It is wonderful that these pants can be worn to any occasion and look elegant with either a blouse or a tank top. I wouldn’t recommend them for deep winter, but for now they have become part of my favorite indoor lounge suit.What I liked best about these pants was the loose, flowing fabric.

The fabric is incredibly lightweight making it a nice alternative to shorts in the summer.  I'm not a huge fan of the elastic ankles but that's more of a personal preference.  Overall, these are a nice pair of yoga/casual pants that I'll get a lot of use out of for yin classes and everyday wear.  Fit is true to the size chart and very forgiving due to the extremely elastic waist.  I'm happy with the purchase.",
Rosemary,Super cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R2UU2LDEG5TY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJT4YNXY,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 8, 2024",Color: Circle RedSize: X-Large,,"These Boho harem pants are very cute. The colors are bright and just as pictured. The cloth is a thin cloth and not stretchy, but it is definitely baggy so you don’t really need the stretch. The waistband is a nice thick waistband that stretches easily. I really like these pants, these will go great with a fitted T. They seem to be made well and do not have any funny odors. I really look forward to wearing these pants because they are super comfortable.",

I was a little nervous as I have put on a few pounds and was nervous they wouldn’t fit. Well! They fit nice.  Not only do they fit nicely, they look great too. The design is beautiful. The material is thin and light. I have a cruise coming up in May and they will be perfect for that.  The band across the waist is wide and high helping to hide love handles.  Overall, I am happy with these pants. I would recommend. 👍🏾",
