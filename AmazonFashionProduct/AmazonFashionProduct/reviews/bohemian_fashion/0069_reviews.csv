The material is thin and feels cheap, almost like it could tear with the slightest snag. The dress is also poorly constructed, with uneven stitching and loose threads everywhere. The sizing is way off – it's either too tight in some areas or way too loose in others, making it uncomfortable and unflattering to wear. The photos online are very misleading compared to what you actually get. Definitely not worth the price, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",2

Compliments.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15QNKEOEEY59Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07WGBKRQH,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 18, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Multicolor-blue,Verified Purchase,"Lots & lots of compliments on this one, and I wear dresses often enough, so it’s not just the novelty of wearing a dress that’s earning the nods.. it’s the dress itself.  I did change a few things: 1) I hand-sewed the lower, open front closed from just below the waist, and downward. (Super easy). Now I step into it & still wrap with the ties. I’m not comfortable with a possibly-open front or tall “slit”, plus I was going to be on a high stage for one event, so I don’t need people staring up the dress. 2) I wear a cami under it, because otherwise it would plunge quite low. I’ve done navy or white, but the white looks best. I may permanently sew in a white mock-camisole (again, super easy for the non-sewer… I kinda make it up as I go) 3) I’m not a fan of the flare sleeves. They just get in my way. So far I haven’t changed them, and it’s been ok. But I plan to get rid of the flares… perhaps convert into a long sleeved ballon sleeve. I might have to get help figuring that out.  Washing is easy in washer or by hand. Don’t put it in the dryer. The rayon will shrink. But the nice thing about the rayon: it makes for an easy travel dress. Stuff it in your bag (takes up little space), pull it out, hang, spray with some water. Then either let it hang overnight or give the damp dress a few straightening rugs & the wrinkles come out easily, then dry quickly.  Very lightweight & breezy. Fun when the wind catches it a little. The lightweight-ness and ease of getting rid of wrinkles are the positives, if the trade off is a fabric made of plastic (rayon). But honestly, nothing else is as breezy as rayon. Sigh. So one smash-hit in my closet will be ok.  Really like the colors & pattern. A little boho style, but it really seems to work with most people. Favorite dress in about 5 years!",3

Also tried a different color and larger size but it was too long and it wasn’t as flattering.  The wrap tie is a little too high for my short frame so I quick-stitch the top and bottom closed, or alter the ties and move them down. Might wear it over a body suit or shorts since the split is more in the middle than on the side. It’s a pretty color and I like the sleeves so for me it would be worth it.

It is made of a lightweight material, it fits correctly and lays well, and u think it is quite complimentary. The one drawback for me is that the length of the wrap around belt is too short!

Ok, this dress is true to size. I’m 38B on top, 5’3 in height and I weigh 140 pounds. The dress goes down to your feet but not to the floor. The dress flows nicely, non transparent in this blue turquoise print, fabric is light and it’s not stretchy. If your 36/38 around the bust area, go with the large. Always go with your bust size when it’s a wrap dress because it determines the weith of your back and if the fabric is not stretchy, you won’t get away with a medium. I have a tiny waist and that part of any dress is always adjustable. It’s your back, chest and shoulders that determine your correct fit. So anyone 36 to 38 is a large. 39 to40 XL and 34 to 36 a medium and a small anywhere bellow is a small. If you don’t have a flat stomach, keep in mind you will have less fabric to wrap around you and your slit will be more open, but it will still look nice and sexy. You can dress up or dress down this dress. It’s beautiful and I received many compliments. Hope this information helped.",40
