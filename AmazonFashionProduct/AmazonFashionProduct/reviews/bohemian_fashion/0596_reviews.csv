I bought it for a resort vacation. I tried a few others before selecting this one and none compare. The quality is perfect. It's lightweight, soft, came with no snags or imperfections, and does not wrinkle. The color is a true khaki, it pairs beautifully with everything, and it compliments tanned skin. The shape is everything. The lower v-neckline is not too low, the straps are not at all bulky but are still just wide enough to cover thicker swimsuit straps, and the weave is opaque enough to help you feel covered. The shape is extremely flattering even with hips, a tummy, and a bum. It has two subtle slits on the sides and reaches mid-thigh on me. It makes you feel put together, looks fitting as resort wear, but would also be perfect for a pool day with the kids. At the first sight of mine showing wear, I'll be repurchasing for sure.",2
