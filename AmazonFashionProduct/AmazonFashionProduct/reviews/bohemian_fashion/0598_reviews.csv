Love everything about these dresses, the material, prints, tassels….they fit comfortably and the length is perfect for what I was looking for. I have enough shorter dresses and wanted a little longer. They are boho, flow nicely and definitely not frumpy. I bought these dresses for upcoming travel to Egypt and to wear at home. Wore one to a BBQ and received many compliments. They will pack well and should be great for travel.  Update - wore these dresses on my Egypt trip and they worked out perfectly, even in 115 degrees!

I could not have treated this garment with more care!  It shrunk SIGNIFIGANTLY!  The top is now fully form fitting where it hung off of me in a perfectly relaxed and flowy fit before.  NOT HAPPY!  Excessive shrinkage is a mark of poor quality and should be disclosed to the buyer, size up.  So now I am afraid to wash the red one.  Also, FYI, the yellow has a draw string, no elastic and no pockets. The red has elastic, no draw string, and it does have pockets.
