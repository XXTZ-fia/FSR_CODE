The colors are beautiful. The quality of how they’re made is great, the value of money I would say that Temu is a lot cheaper so they need to try to hit their price point if they want people to continue to buy this skirt and the best thing of all is they have pockets I love any dresses or pants that have pockets I give these skirts a 10 out of 10 since I have four from Amazon and Three from Temu and they are made exactly the same.

Welllll it’s a size smaller. Not by their label—just in how it fits. How disappointing! I’m tall (5’9”) and wear size 12 (M in Old Navy bottoms).  I don’t know why I keep buying anything that isn’t Grace Karen online. Every once in a while I’ll get something good but this is a DRY CLEANING ONLY skirt.  …which means it really shouldn’t be in the washer even on delicate like the other reviews said. Definitely don’t put it in the dryer.  It’s cotton. 100%  The black had a chemical smell, though. Off white didn’t.  Super disappointed. I pretty much only wear black so the first order was me being daring.  Not for plus size/curvy or short people. Unfortunate.",
