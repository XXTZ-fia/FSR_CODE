I can tell the buttons will not stay and I’ll have to secure them better due to how you have to pull to get them secure. Other than that love this and got do many compliments on it",

I ordered it anyways hoping that on my 5’3” frame that it may , fingers crossed, work. Well it didn’t. At least not as a dress. I adore this “dress” (I hesitate calling it a dress because generally speaking, it’s missing half of it) so much though, that I’m going to keep it and wear it with cropped denim bottoms and wear it as a tunic/babydoll top and pair it with a cute summery clutch, metallic sandals and statement earrings.

The quality is that of a Zimmerman dress. The pictures on Amazon don’t do it justice. It’s sort of a heavy linen feel, the eyelets are brocade, the colors are absolutely beautiful. I ordered a large, I probably could go to a medium, but I’ll probably wear it with some fun espadrilles. I can’t wait!! Absolutely buy this dress! You won’t be sorry!",22
