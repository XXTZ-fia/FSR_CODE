I have a bit more of a tummy area and it IS almost snug there, but not  tight or uncomfortable.  I do not like clothes to be form fitting, I like loose fitting clothes, so when I sit down the clothes don't show my rolls.  This shirt didn't do that too much, but I did notice it tends to ride upwards and I have to pull it back down once in a while, and that was today during lunch with friends.  The length is good, covers my butt, so I just pull it up a little to get that more relaxed look back there.  The quality is great especially for the price.  I will order in other colors.",3

I ordered based on the measurement chart provided. While I should have extra room with the small, I do not. The bust is form fitting as are the sleeves. The rest of the shirt has some room so it isn't form fitting in my torso and has a nice looser look. Overall the sleeves and length of the shirt are shorter than pictured.  Overall, I like the shirt and love the color even though it doesn't fit quite as pictured. I would recommend anyone purchasing go a size up unless you are already well under the size chart measurements. It definitely runs smaller than the sizing chart recommendations probably by about two inches in my case.",
LovesGadgets,Nice overall shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4T569B2BVSUE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGPDXXNS,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 16, 2024",Color: PinkSize: Small,,I got this shirt for my daughter that she can wear by itself or underneath a sweater. The material is soft and somewhat stretchable. She likes that the sleeves are 3/4 giving it a casual look. She is wearing it with jeans and it looks nice on her. Of course pink is her favorite color and it’s a nice shade not too bright. She likes it.,

JaCkie O`lAnTeRn,Fits true to size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ480UK88Y5VN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGPDXXNS,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Color: Royal BlueSize: X-Large,,"(SPIFF at bottom) The shirt is nice and soft. It is slightly see through so I wouldn't suggest a black bra, unless you don't care about that. If you're someone who gets hot easily, this is a great shirt to stay cool in. As someone who has snowy winters, I'll enjoy not feeling overheated after coming in front the cold. I have my other shirt stuffed around my waist, but it fits my arms and chest quite well. It will lay nicely with whatever bottoms I choose. My only bummers were that the ruffles/upper design lines weren't as fluffy or visible to me, and I'm not going to be able to easily wash this. Since it's thinner material it could pill or get roughed up in the wash machine. So it will go with my gentle washes. You do not need to hand wash it, gentle wash cycle and hang dry will work fine. Maybe the lack of seeing the design is because of my chest size, but I still really like the shirt. I just didn't look as cool as the model. Lol She had more room for the design though. I suggest you buy a few in multiple colors. SMELL: the shirt had no smell to it. Not over perfumed, unpleasant, or factory smelling. PACKAGING: I actually like the bag it came in. It has a zipper along the top and I can use reuse it when packing or to store items. IS IT RECOMMENDED: Yes FEEL: quite soft. thinner material FIT: True to size. I ordered an XL & there's nowhere on the shirt that seems to be stretched out.",13
NJ Review,Nice top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NJCHGMJDQ0R8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGPDXXNS,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2024",Color: Royal BlueSize: Medium,,It’s a nice top to wear.

The pleats across the bust add a beautiful touch. The neckline looks nice. The fit is as expected, and the length is good. Great for when the weather cools down, but you don’t need a jacket yet. Would look nice with a lightweight cardigan also. Seems lightweight, but made well.",4
Lisa W,Pay attention to the measurements.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VT5TGJZ3SBUA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGPDXXNS,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2024",Color: Light BlueSize: Large,,"I ordered this OFEEFAN Womens Top in the Light Blue, which is really nice and true to color on the stock photos.  I especially like that it’s not a solid blue, but more of a two-tone blue, which makes it more interesting.  I got the top in the Large size, since most times I wear a size 12-14.  I have to say, though, that this Large size is more of a Medium-Large, because while the shoulder seams are slightly over the shoulders, the torso and arms are more form-fitting, unlike what is shown on the model.  I stay pretty consistent in weight, so I’m pretty sure it’s not me.  If you like a snug look, then this is the top for you.  The pleats are flattering and add to its overall nice design.  In all, it is a very nice top.  Just pay attention to the size measurements on the product page.",2
