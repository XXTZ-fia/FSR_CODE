I was pleasantly surprised at the soft material and they drape nicely. The small looks oversized on me as I could definitely use an extra small. I am attaching images of 4 different colors. The black is definitely not as shown in the image! The other colors were a decent match. One thing I will mention too is that sizing is inconsistent.  The sleeves on some of these are super long and go past the tips of my fingers.,3

In some of the photos, it looks cheap. But in person, it’s super soft and almost seems like alpaca wool. It also fits really nicely. The colors are not as expected — the khaki is missing the orange contrast stripes, which was one of the aspects that drew me to this sweater… but it’s still cute.  I was concerned about putting it in the dryer to get the creases out from being folded during shipping (seen in my photo), but I put it in the dryer on low and it came out fluffed up and mostly wrinkle free — also super static-y. I don’t think I’ll put it in the dryer after washing but when it’s dry it seems to do just fine.",3

It’s very soft and has an almost angora feel to it. It looks just like the pictures and although the bottom hem does appear to possibly be inside out, it certainly still looks very pretty and I’m not convinced it’s unintentional. It fits very well, true to size, and is a good length. It is flattering and the colors are vibrant and pretty. Due to the angora-like quality, there is a slight bit of shedding on the brown style, but it did not get on my under shirt and I did not find it problematic. My only critique is that it is a bit static-y, which I believe is to be expected since it is acrylic. But it is warm and soft, so overall I am very happy with purchase. A unique, very boho vibe that I love. I would definitely recommend if the static issue is not a deal breaker. The tassels do stay put and are not getting attracted to the sweater, so it is fine by me. It’s really not bad.  It’s a nice long sweater that is true to the pictures and I would therefore recommend in brown. Not sure about the navy though as the shedding seems more noticeable in the pictures due to the dark color. But I did only purchase brown so I can’t speak on that for sure. Just my inclination from reading other reviews.",10

I shouldn't have bought it because I HATE collars like this, they roll weird, they show the seam, they sit wonky. But that is my fault, I should have looked closer. I got swept away by the length and the tassels. I had to wash and dry it to shrink it a little, it was bulky in the shoulders and body, and it did shrink and now fits well (disregarding the collar.

We try all their food before they eat it to make sure it isn’t poisoned and our older daughter’s sweaters on to make sure they aren’t not too itchy. Anyway, it’s not itchy at all and it’s so cute that I’m currently back on Amazon to buy myself one. It took a lot not to hang this one right up in my closet. Oh and my daughter loves it too. She loves it so much in fact, she forgot another sweater here when she left. And I’m currently wearing it while looking for that other sweater.
