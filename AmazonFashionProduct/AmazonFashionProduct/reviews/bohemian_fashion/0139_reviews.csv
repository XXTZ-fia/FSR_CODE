The sizing can run a little small….sometimes. Ones I ordered a couple years ago are smaller than the ones I just bought despite buying the same size. They hold up well in the wash but sometimes the length will shrink a bit. Just bought two. They were the exact same size until I washed them. Now one is about an inch and a half shorter. Didn’t shrink anywhere else. If you’re large chested, be aware that it might gap a bit at the buttons but there’s a little strip of fabric so it’s not see-through.",

BUT if you are taller and it is not an issue, this is one of my favorite dresses. Rayon is pretty airy and it was cool even on vacation in 95 degree heat.  Very flowy and the neckline wasn't too low (when you are shorter, a normal neckline can plummet).  I have been washing in machine on delicate and hang dry and it is holding up beautifully.

I was really skeptical about purchasing another dress on Amazon made for plus size girls because I usually feel like I’m wearing a big cloth or bag over my body. However, this dress gets an A grading because it actually accentuates my curves and fits nicely. It doesn’t hug any areas too tightly and has a nice flow. I would give it an A+ (five star rating) if the cut of the shoulders and chest area were more in a v-shape like the model, and if the belt area sat exactly at my waistline. I have an hourglass body type, so my waist sits a lower than the belt, yet it’s hard to tell and still fits lovely (I just won’t be able to accessorize the dress with a belt). I think the dress would also look better on me if I had bigger boobs (I’m a 34B), but there’s nothing I can do about that 😄. Overall, beautiful flower-designed dress made of decent material - it’s not paper thin, has an underskirt and does not feel scratchy against my skin. At my height and weight, the dress stops at my ankles and has a split in the front that is approximately the length of my legs. I hope more dresses similar to this can be made with more designs, but floor-length and without splits.",6
