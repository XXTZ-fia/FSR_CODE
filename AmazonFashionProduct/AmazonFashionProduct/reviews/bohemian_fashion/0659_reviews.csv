It’s the perfect boho look and feel. If you’re someone who is cold all the time at restaurants, movie theaters, etc., it’s the perfect cardigan bc it folds up super small but the material is good enough quality (even with the little holes) to keep you pretty warm when the air conditioning is blasting. It would make for a great gift too!",2
