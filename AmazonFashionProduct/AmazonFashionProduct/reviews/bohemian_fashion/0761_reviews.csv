I’m a little bit chesty, but medium shoe usually fit and this one I could barely get on. Also, they said it was a wraparound and basically yes, it was, but in my day , wraparounds where you could pull it as tight and loosen it up as you want and this one is sewed all the way up now that may be the style today this I don’t know about the size really irritated me so I’m going to be sending it back tomorrow and going to the Caribbean so I won’t have time to order another one.

I have purchased it in a pattern and now this solid blue. It is the perfect dress to wear in the summer with its light, airy fabric that flows beautifully when you walk. The 100% rayon is machine washable, but hang it to dry because rayon is not a material that can handle being dried.  I do find it to be a little low cut, so I tacked the front of the dress so it is a little more modest. The other odd thing is that it really isn’t finished on the edges with a hem, but rather is serged on all the edges. Surprisingly, it holds up well and doesn’t ravel, but just something to keep in mind if you prefer a more finished look.",

The fit was flattering and the color was perfect. The material is rayon, which is thin, cheaper material, and tends to wrinkle easily. Knowing this before I purchased it, I felt I knew what I was getting & didn’t have overly high expectations. What surprised me most was how flattering the dress is on. I’m 5’0 ft, weigh 126ish and ordered the small even though Amazon suggested a medium, I felt the medium would be too much material for my height. The small fit perfectly. I ironed this with a spray starch to give the material a little more structure & combat wrinkles & this worked fine. I wore this all day and it held up great. Upon ironing this dress I did notice a shoulder seam that wasn’t fully sewn which was frustrating to have to mend at the last minute. That being said, I’m still happy overall with this purchase. I knew for the price and material that it would be a dress I would wear a few times & donate, that’s just been my history with anything rayon because it doesn’t hold up overtime. I felt the price of the dress was appropriate & the description was spot on. It worked great for what I needed & I’m happy with my purchase.",
