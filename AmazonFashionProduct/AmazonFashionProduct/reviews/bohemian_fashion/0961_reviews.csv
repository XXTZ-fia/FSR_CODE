michelle,Terrible quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PDIEOLKXUXYY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4DRKF1D,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2024",Size: 30 RegularColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"We ordered these for my daughter, and the wrong pattern came. She gave them a try though, and after wearing them for about 15 minutes, they started to tear in many different places along the seams. The fabric isn't a patch pattern; it's actual patches of fabric sewed together, very shodily. They aren't made well at all. So disappointing!",4
