The color is really lovely and the texture is quite interesting! The straps are wider than a typical tank top, so that makes it easier to wear and adds to the functionality of the top. It has a flowy fit, which aligns with the boho style here. It's less flattering than some tops, since it flows away from the body and has a kind of boxy shape, but that's what I was expecting. It's kind of dual-layered or lined I guess you would say, so the top layer is a bit sheer and doesn't have any stretch, but the underneath layer, the lining, it's a different material that is more opaque and has some stretch to it. Plus, the straps have some elastic stretch to fit a variety of frames. Can be dressed up or down.",

It's not terrible and again, I'm being really picky and you might not feel the same way when you see it in person.
