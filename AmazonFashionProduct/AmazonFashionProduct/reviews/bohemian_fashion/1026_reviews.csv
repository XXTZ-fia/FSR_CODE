The fabric just felt like a cheap glam retardant fabric like thin fuzzy cardboard in my opinion so I had to return,

Because they’re never quite the same as they are when these girls do their “Amazon hauls”. I’m literally thinking of applying for an Amazon LTK link because I am ALL about those dupes and I get dozens of Amazon packages a week. 😅 Oops.  So- the pants. I ordered my regular size, an XS, and the first thing I wish it had was a drawstring waist. Also, the inseam from the elastic to the crotch is extremely long, which is usually great for me because I have a long torso, but they just didn’t fit right whether they were on my hips or on my waist. They were also a bit scratchy, definitely not the super soft pants you want to lounge around in, but maybe washing would help?  I did like the color and the deep pockets, and I loved the tapered overlapping bottom, which gave them some cute boho style. They’re breathable, which is great for my AZ “fall/winter” season when it could be 98 degrees or it could be 49.
