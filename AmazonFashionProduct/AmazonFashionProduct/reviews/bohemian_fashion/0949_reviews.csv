The fabric of the solid dresses was actually very synthetic and created massive static cling. Great for humid climates. Modest dress but the sewn lines fell awkwardly just below the curve of (the bottom) and wasn’t the most attractive fit (I am 5-11” and much curvier on the bottom half:) It would work better for a less curvy person I think. Could be the static too. Easily wrinkled. Not a good travel dress.,

It is by far the most comfortable dress I have ever owned. It washes beautifully on the delicate cycle.  The most amazing aspect is the compliments I have received...41 to date...from strangers while on a walk, shopping, going to games etc.. It has become the family joke. There goes Mom and another compliment. It doesn't matter which color I wear. All the dresses elicit the same response from strangers just passing by. At 78 years old, when my 15 year old granddaughter wished it came in teen sizes, I knew I had a winner.",
