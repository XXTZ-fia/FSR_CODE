However, there were a few aspects that kept it from being a perfect fit for me.  The first thing to note is the length. While it's listed as a mini dress, it falls more like a tunic on me. If you're looking for a dress with more coverage, this might not be the best choice.  The dress also arrived quite wrinkled. While most clothes require some ironing, this one seemed excessively wrinkled from packaging. More substantial fabric or different packaging might help reduce wrinkles.  The overall quality of the dress felt a bit on the lower side. While it's perfectly fine for casual wear, don't expect a super well-made garment.  Considering these factors, I'd rate the Dokotoo dress at 3 stars. It has a cute design, but the short length, excessive wrinkling, and lower quality material hold it back.",3

The A-line shape of the dress is okay, but it would be more flattering if the waist had more shape to it.

I finally settled on red, which is really pink with far too many red flowers for my taste. I used Dokotoo's size chart, and the top of the dress is too tight, while the rest of it is loose.  This is really a baby doll dress updated for 2024, but the fit in mine is way off, and I can't wear it out of the house. The tight top of the dress shows all of my bra, and I've tried this with several different bras. It never changes. When I saw the fabric the dress is made of when it arrived, I wasn't happy with what I saw. The dress is pink with red flowers, as in the listing picture, but the red flowers are everywhere, much too busy a pattern for me.  I like the way this dress is made, a swing dress or a baby doll dress, but there's a little too much fabric on the bottom of the dress and too little on the top of the dress to suit me. I can't wear this out of my home because the top part of the dress is skin-tight. This also makes it very hard to take this off and put it on over my head.  In the top of the listing information, we're told the dress is machine washable, but further down we're told it's hand wash only in 30-degree water or less and hang it to dry or line dry it.  This dress is a very disappointing product as far as how it fits (doesn't fit, really) so tight in the top that it shows every bit of your bra, and I did try a few bras with this. The bottom of the dress is flowing and is sort of a swing dress. The fabric doesn't look anything like the listing pictures in person, which can happen to anyone, but it looks cheap in person.  I can't recommend this dress because there are too many inconsistencies in it. It's too tight at the top but is very loose and flowing on the bottom of the dress. The fabric is cheap, 100% viscose, and it's very loud and busy with red flowers all over the pink fabric it's made in. Also, I don't like to see products advertised in the top of the listing information as machine washable, but then further down their information tells you it's hand wash only, line or hang dry. Overall, this is a disappointment because it's not well made and is something I'd never wear outside my home.",

I wear a size A cup so it fits me good, but definitely a snug fit.

The material feels so soft and flowy and with the small pattern is very feminine. I like the fact that it has a high waist (A-Line) for a slimmer look. I also like the cut of the dress and since it's supposed to be a mini dress, it actually comes up above my knees. At five feet tall, usually dresses look a little too long on me, but not this one. The draw string adds a nice touch and it looks good left loose or tied. The dress looks great with a pair of sandals, sneakers or even with a pair of fun boots! I washed the dress in cold water, delicate cycle and dried it in my dryer and it held up well and it didn't come out wrinkled either. However, the reason why I'm not giving this dress five stars is because there' a little too much material around the waist. I ordered my regular size and it fits a little too big on me. I would have preferred it if it wasn't so loose fitting.",
