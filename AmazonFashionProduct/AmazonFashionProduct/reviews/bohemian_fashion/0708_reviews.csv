AnaC,It fit and looks exactly like the photos,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NX6U402CNP61/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9447PX7,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 20, 2024",Color: BlueSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I'll try to circle back here and add a photo one day. In the meantime, I was happily surprised by the quality and fit. I've ordered 10 different blouses from other companies and legit returned each one. Ordering clothes on Amazon is such a gamble and so frustrating sometimes. This blouse is the only one that looks exactly as you see it pictured and the only one I've kept. I ordered a medium and it is exactly a medium. I'm 5'6 and 157. If you are a little heavier you might want to go up. I don't have inches and inches of room all over.  The cut is feminine and the fabric soft, to me. I like it.",

If I had chosen one of the darker colors, I don't think I would have this issue, but the baby blue just doesn't work for me.  However, there are other colors to choose from and you might not have this issue with the same color.  The details on the shirt are cute and it fits well so it might be an option for others out there even though it didn't work for me.",

It is a touch on the sheer side, so I ended up having to wear a tank top underneath it. It was generally true to size and was on the flowy side, so if you are in between sizes I would recommend sizing down (unless you prefer an oversized fit). The shirt is lightweight and comfortable and very cute overall. I was also pleasantly surprised that the material was not scratchy feeling, which I was a bit nervous about.",

I wear a small and found this fit well. I would warn though that unlike other garments it isn’t very stretchy and it would be easy to get the wrong size. So be careful with sizing as there isn’t a lot of give especially around the shoulder area. The fabric is nice and light. Great for summer wear. I love the cut. It is super feminine and pretty. It does come in a vacuum packed bag and when just pulling it out of the bag there are wrinkles. My picture is of it before getting rid of the wrinkles. Overall, I am happy with this blouse.",2

It was vacuum sealed, thus quite wrinkly upon opening. But I always wash new clothes before wearing, and after washing and drying I did not need to iron the shirt. I usually wear a Medium, which is what I got, and it’s a bit of an oversize fit. I got the light blue and the color was exactly what I expected. The fabric is not too thin or see through- which is a bonus so I don’t have to wear another shirt underneath. Recommend!",

Customer Review,"Cute Top, But Fabric Not Soft",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TINK93ATEHHK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9447PX7,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 29, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,,"This is a cute top, but the fabric texture is too rough.  The fit is exactly as expected.  I will wash the shirt a few times to see if it softens up.  I think it will need to be steamed even after washing because there are so many deep wrinkles from the vacuum packaging that it came in.  I will wear it whether or not it softens up, but I would really love the top if it was soft and comfy.Update:  After machine washing this top on permanent press Cold and drying on Low, it is somewhat softer.  It may continue to soften with additional washes.  The wrinkles didn't come out in the wash as I suspected, so I still need to steam them out before wearing.",

LB,"Cute black blouse, fits great, HOWEVER …",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TXTZRM4QM9AU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9447PX7,"2.0 "," the United States "," August 26, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,,"This blouse was packaged and shipped in a clear vacuum-sealed bag. Until I opened it up I couldn’t figure out what it was! Kudos for space saving ingenuity!  The blouse itself is really cute and it fit great! Those two features earned the two stars.  Aside from its good points, I can’t rate it any higher. I tried it on and took it off. A few hours later I had an itchy neck that got worse overnight, but I didn’t connect the itch to the blouse right away. I was going to toss the black blouse in with a load of dark clothes, but first, I picked up the packaging to throw it away. I was surprised to see a distinct pattern that had transferred from the dye in the blouse onto the white cardboard. That’s some strong dye!  Meanwhile, my neck had become so itchy and red that I had to start an antihistamine along with the RX cream I had begun applying during the night.  Whatever chemical or additive is in the fabric is not worth taking a chance it will contaminate the washing machine or other clothes. I can’t even think about wearing this blouse without wondering if all of the ‘whatever caused the rash’ is completely out of it. Sadly, I am tossing it in the trash.  I cannot recommend this item as is. :(",
