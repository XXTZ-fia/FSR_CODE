The material is nice and doesn't feel or look cheap. And, since I'm short (5'0), I rolled up the waist a few times and it doesn't look scrunched or wonky at all. And the pockets are lower so when I rolled it up they were still useable which was awesome, I usually have problems with that. And the color was exactly what I wanted. I haven't worn it out yet but I have a feeling it will become a comfort wear. Will def get more colors. The only wish I have is that it wasn't so long for the shorter girlies! But that's nothing a tall boot can't fix.",

The a-line cut is so flattering on my mom bod and hides the tummy well. It’s flowy and comfortable. I meant to size up 1 to a large and accidentally bought an XL and I’m glad I did. The waist is stretchy enough but not tight. It did shrink slightly in the dryer but not too much. Just make sure you take it out immediately and lay flat to avoid wrinkles. Did not have any wrinkles after a full day of wearing. I also bought the lake color along with the black and both are gorgeous. The black is slightly more forgiving though. I just wish there was a light tan or mauve/dusty rose type color. Will be buying more for sure. Oh and the pockets are nice and deep.,13
