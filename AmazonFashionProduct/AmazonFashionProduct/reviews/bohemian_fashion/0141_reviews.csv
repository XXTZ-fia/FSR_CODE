Im 5'5"" 120 lbs. Probably could wear a small, but got the medium due to my larger chest. Love the fit. Love the feel. Love the look. Feminine. Love the neckline ( not too low) and the long sleeve length.. ( cute lil ruffle look) Can wear dressy or casual. Summer or fall. They are long enough to wear over leggings...camouflages a big behind, and tummy, or "" the lack of "" a behind. In other words no behind. Not too billowy either. Flattering.",6

Amazon Customer,Fabric is soft and high quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EMY65G9FR09L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B3M471N7,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2024",Color: Purple Long Sleeve ShirtsSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"This shirt washes and wears very nicely. The fabric feels like a high quality pima cotton, even though it is a synthetic blend. Be aware, the model in the product photos is quite flat chested, so it might not be obvious that the smocked area will fit snugly. Despite the snug fit, the shirt is still flattering on me, and if I had sized up, I think the lower half of the shirt would have been too loose.  I am very happy with how it fits along the neckline. Thanks to the smocked fit, I can lean forward without showing any cleavage or showing my bra strap. I also like that I can push up the smocked sleeves to wash my hands, etc. and they will stay put (although I don't think it would be very comfortable to leave the sleeves pushed up all day). I will probably purchase a couple more in different colors.",6

Entropic Variable,Not for My Rectangle/Hourglass Figure,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPRX8I7U22FFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B3M471N7,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 29, 2024",Color: Purple Long Sleeve ShirtsSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I’m 5’7” & 125 lbs. Bust/Waist/Hips: 37”/29”/36”. Which puts me between a Rectangle and Hourglass figure type, so garments that are fitted to and accentuate my natural waist are always the most flattering on me.  I most often wear a medium and the Amazon algorithm recommended a medium, so that’s what I tried. The shoulders and sleeves fit me well, the neckline was cute, the bodice was comfortable and flattering for my B/C bust, and the length hit just below my booty and crotch which would have made this perfect for pairing with leggings.  Unfortunately the transition from smocking to peplum on the bodice falls about 3” ABOVE my natural waist and lays squarely on my ribcage. The overall effect in my case is to dramatically widen the appearance of my midsection and figure overall, which is the absolute least flattering thing any garment can do for my body type. If the transition fell at my natural waistline this would be a perfect cut top for me and I'd buy it in multiple colors.  I’m guessing that this would probably work best for women with very short torsos, or Apple/Round/Oval or Pear/Triangle or Spoon or Diamond figure types. Or maybe as early gestation maternity wear.  The purple that I ordered was very pretty and was as shown in the Amazon image, and I was impressed with the overall quality of the piece for the cost. But since it absolutely didn’t work for my figure, I had to return it.",12

I took off one star because the area inside of the ruffles at the end of the sleeves is not printed and I don't like that it is white.
