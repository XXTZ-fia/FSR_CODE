I am normally pretty solid 2X in everything I buy but because this has no stretch I decided to size up. I don’t think I would have necessarily needed a size bigger but I still like the fit! I am 5’7” (long torso) and it hits me just above the knee. I also appreciate that it is lined inside so it isnt cheap or flimsy-feeling. The embroidery is absolutely beautiful and makes the dress worth every penny. I may buy another in another color!,6

Nice woven fabric and the embroidery makes it look very expensive.  This can be styled up or down.  I wore with black leather flip flops, but could be dressed up as well.  Loose fit, I usually wear anXL so that’s what I ordered, but I could have sized down a size, but still happy with it because I’m 5’8” and I love the length the XL gives me just above the knees.
