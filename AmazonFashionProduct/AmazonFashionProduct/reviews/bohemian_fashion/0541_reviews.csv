It's lightweight, fits really well, the bust is nice and stretchy and I love the detailing at the bottom. Our honeymoon is in Puerto Vallarta and it's sort of reminds me of a Mexican type style of dress. It did have quite a few wrinkles but a quick steam takes them all out. I tried on a few dresses that were very similar that were see through but this one isn't see through at all. However, it does have a slip that gets a little staticky, so be mindful of that. Overall this is a great dress and I can't wait to wear this to our brunch as well as while we're in Mexico on our honeymoon!",

She loved it and wanted another  in navy blue.  Tag says 100% Rayon and Made in China. While browsing internet I came across what appears to be and looks like the very same dress I bought, ONLY a they sell for approx $16.99 with a few dollars shipping. No, there is not the Zesica name tag but pics in all the exact same colors look the same and state Made in China, where the zesica brand is made. Of course it could be totally different , who knows.I WENT AHEAD and ordered the EXPENSIVE navy dress on here and it arrived today, and looks very nice but extremely wrinkled , like the white one was.I was still curious about what looks like the same exact pics but much cheaper price dress and low and behold I found a listing right here on Amazon.  Appears to me to match same pics of name brand, expensive versions I bought. We shall see.  These sell for $18.99 with a 6% off coupon, and a shipping fee. Total was $25.27.  YES, I purchased a white one in a size Small for my younger daughter JUST TO SEE HOW DIFFERENT IT IS GOING TO BE from the name brand $63.00 ones. Since it’s too good to be true I am assuming this cheaper dress will be sub par in a way, who knows? Seller on Amazon  is eipogp and description starts with “ Womans Tube top maxi dress summer boho strapless——.I think this is interesting and will UPDATE everyone after I receive the white dress I ordered for a mere $25.27 ( same pic as expensive ones) . Says arriving July 2— July15Don’t know if Amazon will put this through, if not I will write another reviewUPDATE—UPDATE- UPDATE—. Rec this dress and started a return. The clear plastic bag dress was packaged in has large black letters stating “ ZANZEA “  ( Remember, the expensive dress I bought in white ,and my other daughter loved was from “ ZESICA”. This dress was a completely different material, like a shinny polyester. Daughter did not like material. Also, it did not have the sewn in interior slip like the expensive ZESICA dress. She said she did want to have to wear a slip. Also, it was about 5 to 6” shorter than the expensive ZESICA dress and she said it was too short. OVERALL though, in my opinion ( as daughters mom) for the price and if you don’t mind wearing a slip , and it was a good length for you, and it did not hang as well as the expensive one, I thought many people would probably be ok with this dress for the price.",10

Bubblygirl,I'm on the fence about this dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AD0505DG6RAM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49NW661,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 23, 2023",Color: NavySize: Large,Verified Purchase,"This dress style is beautiful. It's fitted on top and flowy below the bust. Perfect for hiding a tummy. The material is a gauze-type rayon fabric. Hence the recommendation for dry cleaning. This type of fabric tends to shrink a lot in the wash and definitely requires ironing. That said, it's doable to hand wash or wash on delicate, and hang dry.  The reason I'm not sure if I'll keep the dress or not is because it's very see-through. I bought the navy color thinking that the darker shade wouldn't be as noticeable, but I'm pretty sure people will be able to see through it regardless of the dark color. There is no lining in the dress to help with this issue.  Apart from the thin fabric, the dress is beautiful. The style is flattering and it's very comfortable. I'm consistently a Large (size 12) so I ordered a Large and it fits great. As for length, I'm 5' 5"" and it hits about 4-5 inches above the top of my foot.",38
