I have not washed it yet but I will by hand and dry flat and then may iron to stretch a little . That always helps.,5

This vest has great drape (and won't get in the way if I need to bundle up over it on a frosty February morning) - but it's lightweight and won't be uncomfortable in 80 degree March afternoons. It can be worn over a corset but doesn't need to be. I'm planning on wearing it with boho/harem style pants because the color matches perfectly. Fit is smaller around, as expected, but this isn't meant to close or button, only to drape from shoulders, so it's fine. If you're a bigger/curvier build like me (5'4"", 185, 36D) you're going to love how flattering the drape is. Oh, and the hem in back hits just above the hips for me - it's only longer in the front. Cold water hand washing and air drying are your friends with this. My only concern is fitting it over chemises - it would be great to have about 1-2 more inches of space under the arms for those bulkier types of garments, but it's fine over a t-shirt. I'd love to get a couple more of these this season because they look so good. If you're thinking about it, I recommend it - it's hip, it's fun, and it's going to look better than you may think. I'd include pictures but I haven't hauled out my wardrobe box yet. When I do, I'll take a picture of it with all my garb and try to add it or update the review.",9
