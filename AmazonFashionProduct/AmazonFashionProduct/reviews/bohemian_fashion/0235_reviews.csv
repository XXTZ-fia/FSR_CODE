Patricia T.,Wish they made this as a sleeping shirt!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRFGKZC84NQZ3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDC8MSPN,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 30, 2024",Size: 5XColor: C Dark Grey,Verified Purchase,I wish they sold this at a longer length so that it could be used as a sleeping gown! It’s soft. I have sensitive skin and this doesn’t make me itch. I also hate things that are tight around my neck. This gives you room and you don’t feel like you are choking. Sized right with nice length in the sleeves. Overall it feels nice and gives you some warmth. Upon getting this one I promptly ordered another color that was on sale. I ordered a plus size. It’s loose a little like they stated. I would love to buy a sleeping gown like this as I said. I will try out other things that it offers since they were true to everything they said. Even if you are a plus size like me you will be happy with it!,4

Very comfy and flowy enough over jeans (or leggings if that's your jam). As with most plus size tops, the larger you order the longer the sleeves get, because the manufacturing industry thinks the length of our arms is in direct correlation to the width of our hips? Anyway, I roll the sleeves up as I do with most of my tops, and it's great. Love the pockets - they're actually functional for small items - the length, and the color (green). Haven't washed or worn it too much yet so can't speak to longevity, but I'm eyeing the blush colored one next!",6

It’s sort of a heathery color . The material is just a little bit heavier than a t-shirt and so soft. The length hits me just below the hip (I’m 6’1).
