April Colon,Love these,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3S2I6USNHJT1Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSBZ9SD3,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 22, 2024",,,"I have four pairs of these in size 4x. I have been wearing the same four pairs for approximately three or four years. I have had no issues with tearing at all. The first year I hand-washed them, but over the years I have gotten lazy and thrown them in the washer on cold and dryer until they are dry. It does not take long because they are so lightweight. However, I may need to purchase new ones in the next year since these are getting old. There is a bit of piling of the fabric where my thighs sometimes rub together recently, but that is only because I have been wearing these for so long. They are a part of my main rotation of clothes each week. I love how comfortable they are, I can semi-dress them up or be casual. I live in Florida and can usually wear these all year long but when we have a few weeks of chilly weather. They are my favorite pants for being a heavy-set woman. I love the fact that I was able to wear them when I gained weight due to a medical issue and am now losing weight. The waist is forgiving, however, the fabric is not stretchy so make sure you have plenty of room in the butt and hips. The legs are baggy but comfortable. I dress in a boho-hippie style so it fits my style perfectly. I love these pants and recommend them to anyone who loves the boho-hippie-gypsy style. If this is not your style, you will not like them.",
