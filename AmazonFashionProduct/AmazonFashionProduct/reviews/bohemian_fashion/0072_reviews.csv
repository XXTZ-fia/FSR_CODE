I am a 40D, and the 3Xs fit me perfectly, are loose enough, and are flattering. Additionally, I was so pleased with the vivid colors, and the nice, breathable fabric, lovely embroidery, and quality stitching. The fabric is thicker than some other Mexican blouses I bought in Mexico that are a similar style. I mean thicker in a good way. These are not sheer, so no camisole is needed. I plan on hanging them to dry, or just barely drying on gentle to prevent any possible shrinkage. This seems like it would prevent the need to iron them. I am extremely pleased with these high quality, beautiful blouses. I already have two more picked out!",11
