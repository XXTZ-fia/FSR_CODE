For reference, I'm a 36 C/D depending on the bra. This top fits slightly more loosely than I had expected out of the box, but the tag says 65% cotton so I am glad its slightly loose in case of shrinkage. It's a darling top, you can keep it conservative by buttoning it up fully, or have a little fun showing off the girls by leaving the buttons undone! I'll definitely be ordering this in other colors and might try a Medium if I lose the last 10 pounds I am trying to shed. Overall, I'd recommend getting a size larger than you think you need of you want it to be loose and flowy!",9

In this case, the colors seem to be relatively close to the photo but computer monitors vary. This one has a sort of burnt orange, salmon, and turquoise colors. The fabric is poly cotton and very soft. The tag recommends hand washing or dry cleaning. One I purchased last year pilled because I washed/dried it in my HE equipment. I think the pilling happened in the dryer as the delicate cycle in my HE washer is akin to hand washing and I safely wash all kinds of delicates in it. The fabric is light and airy, nice for hot weather (or if you suffer with hot flashes!) The new ones I just purchased I will hang dry. I am 5'7"", 140 pounds with a 30-year baby bulge and I find these tops very flattering. I always come back for more when my budget budget allows. I will try to post photos soon.",
