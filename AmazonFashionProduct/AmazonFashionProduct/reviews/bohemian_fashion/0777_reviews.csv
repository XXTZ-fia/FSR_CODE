There is no stretch at all in this shirt, so keep that in mind when you order. This is technically a ""V"" neck shirt, but the ""V"" doesn't come down very far, which is a little disappointing, but it is still a flattering look.

My one and only complaint is that it's a tiny bit coarse, material-wise. It's not so much so as to cause significant issues, but it's just enough to consistently notice while wearing.

It gets really old after awhile. So, I was beyond thrilled to put on this shirt & actually have it look as though it was meant for me! It hits just below my hips, and is a nice, loose fit without being baggy & formless. The material is thin, and feels a little...rough, I guess? to me, but not in a way that makes it uncomfortable, just noticeable. I love that the neckline can be worn open or tied, giving two different looks to better fit any occasion - although, when untied the strings are a bit long. I do wish they were about an inch or so shorter - again, not a problem, just a personal preference as I do prefer the open neckline look.  The shirt washes well on a cold cycle, and I've hung to dry with no wrinkling issues. It seems well made with no noticeable loose threads or issues.  I have the beige color, and while very pretty, my one slight complaint is that it has a much more light ""baby pink"" tone to the flowers than I was expecting, but again that is personal preference as I'm not a pink fan. It does look great with jeans in both a dark & light wash, and will be a cute, comfortable top for the spring/summer. And it'll be so nice to feel like I'm wearing a shirt & not a dress!",3

It lays well despite being so thin, and offers good tummy camouflage.It looks cute on. It’s easy to care for –  I washed mine on a delicate cycle and hung it to dry .  I like the blouse, but, I think it might be priced a little bit high for the quality of the material.  Other than that, I think it’s an easy top to wear. It’s a good length, it’s a flattering cut and design, and it comes in a variety of pretty patterns.  I hope it looks fantastic on you!",3

The material is a lightweight polyester—somewhat staticky—that does not stretch. I don’t know why I thought this was a polyester knit, but it is not. It’s likely best for a hot day as it’s quite cool and light. I like the fabric design if not the feel of it.",3
