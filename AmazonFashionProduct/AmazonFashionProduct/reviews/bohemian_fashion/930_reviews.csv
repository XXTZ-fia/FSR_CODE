This is well made and a really nice top. It was slightly larger than expected. It was not so large that I would consider it too large, just a bit larger than expected. It's nice to have the option of the full sleeve down or up a bit with the button up cuff. Washed well (and hung dry) with no noticeable shrinking. The only con is that the top would have benefited from a ""half slip"" like other shirts I've purchased in this type of design to prevent from needing an undershirt because the embroidery is somewhat scratchy on the skin. Maybe this will lessen with further washings? Overall, a lovely shirt with beautiful embroidery detail.",

I got the medium,  I’m 5’3, 142lbs, and I think it would probably be more attractive on someone taller.  The sleeves are too long for me, and the shoulders a little broad, but I do have somewhat narrow shoulders.  The upper half of the tunic is lined with a satiny polyester fabric, and I guess that’s nice, but it felt too binding to me and it took away from the comfort of the cotton.  I don’t want  to sound too negative because it really is pretty, just probably prettier on someone else.",4

Even if I could lose some more weight in my biceps, my back isn't shrinking as I get more and more humped back from age and the arthritis in my spine. So no point trying for a different size. I'm going to check to see if my friend would like it.  Thank you for this. I appreciate getting to try it out.",

Only complaint is that it arrived VERY wrinkled. Machine washed in cold water and hung to dry and it looks much better. Could use a light iron touchup. I used the provided size chart and it fits perfectly. The top looks very much like a well-known expensive brand at a fourth of the price. I'm very happy with the purchase and will probably buy more.!,

The embroidery is machine stitched but well done without any hanging threads or missed stitches. The top is very well constructed with fully serged seams and thoughtfully placed embroidery. There is a lot of embroidery- all down the front, around the hem, cuffs and collar and down the sides. The top can be machine washed on gentle in cold water and tumbled dry on low or hung to dry. There are buttons down the front though they are hard to see in all the embroidery and tabs on the sleeves in case you want to roll them up. There is even an extra button supplied [on the washing instructions tag] in case of loss. The only negative is the shirt is a little itchy on the top of the shoulder where the seams of the shirt and the sleeve meet and there is a lot of embroidery stitching there as well. Hopefully that will soften up with a wash. Otherwise this is a really nice top.",2

One for All,Love the blouse!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R70JCD3KZS2Q3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8B9KHRC,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 31, 2022",,,"Reviewed by spouse:  The print and the colors of this blouse are gorgeous. I would say it runs a bit oversized and I got the extra large and wish I had gotten a large it would’ve been plenty big enough for me. I wanted an oversize fit so I went with the extra large after reading all the reviews, but I feel like a large would’ve fit me much better. This would be cute with jeans probably a tighter style or leggings because it is very long as you can see from my pictures. Not quite long enough to wear as a dress, but almost. It is not very see-through even though it is a cream colored background, so I think it would work with a nude colored bra just fine. It also has buttons on each arm to secure as a 3/4 sleeve. For sizing reference, I’m 5’3, 155 and 34d.",2
