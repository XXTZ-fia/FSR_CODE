Ruth Rittichier,Just As Pictured,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R378GSCB3ZVZ5X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQLSQ356,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 23, 2024",Size: LargeColor: A19 Style19,Verified Purchase,"I was hesitant to buy this, because there were no ratings, and there was shipping charge.  But I am glad I ordered it because the style is cute, print is as pictured, well made, and the fabric isn't the best, but better than the closeup in the photo.  The fabric is 100% polyester, and washes and dries well.  Very comfortable.  One thing I didn't like was that they used white thread on the seams, which shows through somewhat on the black background.",11

Also, because they looked comfortable. There are shades of pink, blue/turquoise, yellow, orange and more. You can wear a variety of styles in tops in a variety of colours. The mermaid design is incredible and beautiful. I the artistic, creative style of the mermaid design - like an artist painted them just for me. They are loose fitting for the HOT summer. The main reason I bought them was because they make me smile and feel happy.",5

That said, they are definitely NOT cotton/linen.  They are rayon.  Nice in its own way, very pretty, but not the fabric I would have preferred.Please, change the description!!!!",3
Francisca Paz,There is nothing cotten or linen in this material.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KWE0QQPTSJFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQLSQ356,"1.0 "," the United States "," June 24, 2024",Size: 3X-LargeColor: B27 Style27,Verified Purchase,Very disappointed with this product. The print on the pant look pixelated. They are not worth wearing in public but comfortable enough to lounge at home or sleep in. I was hoping to have something easy to wear and pack for summer vacation.,7
Susan Beam,So cute and comfy.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25JX1MAUWF8GS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQLSQ356,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 10, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: A09 Style09,Verified Purchase,"Loved the fit. I’m a size 2x and things don’t often fit properly. These were flattering and fit very nicely.  Only thing it didn’t have were labels for laundry. Can’t remember if they’re washable…?  Nice pockets, great quality. I bought 3 pairs of different designs. Will probably purchase more!",6
K. Murray,Runs small.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DHH8RXQ0UCQF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQLSQ356,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 26, 2024",Size: 3X-LargeColor: B27 Style27,Verified Purchase,I love this print - it's beautiful. The fabric is unusual - reminds me of thin drapery fabric. It's soft and smooth but not at all stretchy. My only issue was sizing. I typically order XXL because I like my clothing loose. In this I sized up to 3X and it's still too snug. Wish I had ordered 4X.  Be sure to size up.,4
Lori,Be sure to order larger sizes ! These do run small.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTNMKXU4QC5KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQLSQ356,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 10, 2024",Size: 5X-LargeColor: A12 Style12,Verified Purchase,I love the style and the fabric.

Verypoor sewing job, most of the back side and croch area has very loose stitching as seen in the photo. I would think that quality review would have caught this and seen this much better. I’m afraid to wear them as it looks like it would not take much to pull apart.",2
