I wanted to return it and get something else from this store but I checked and by send back date was a couple of weeks ago and now I’m stuck with a dress that I will never wear. I gave it 3 stars because I took one off for breathe ability, which the dress shows is possible if you are constantly dancing in circles, and 1star for the size being too big. I ordered a small and it fit like a M/L.  If the company allowed me to return it I would have better things to say about it.

I was initially nervous on reading all the reviews on what size to choose -I first had a small ticked, but after checking the guide size, I changed it to a medium because of my 36 bust, and I was so happy as this bust area needs room.  I am in shape and athletic 5 foot 5 and weigh 130 pounds ( the length was perfect) I'm usually between a small and medium as it depends on the bust area but I knew from my past bodace dresses that you need room in the bust and not be squashed. It arrived quickly, and it fits perfectly- I just ordered it in 3 more colors. YOU cannot go wrong with this dress- just read the sizing chart carefully, and if you are even one inch above the recommended size in bust, go up a size. ❤️ The dress is flowy and hides you from the waist down, so it's all about your bust size and arms. 🧚🏿‍♂️✌️ I'll try and upload a pic when I try it on next.
