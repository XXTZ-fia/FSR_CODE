Which I like better!!  I am 5’2” and 122 lbs, very much rectangular shaped. The dress is  beautiful, with pockets, and comfortable. I am concerned abt washing instructions: lay flat to dry.  Hmm, that’s not convenient for me. I am also worried abt the length as I will need to hem it, and possibly take in the sides in the bust area (or add a piece of elastic in back) as it’s too big on top. So, all these things are a bit much to deal with to make the dress functional; I’m still considering sending it back.",
