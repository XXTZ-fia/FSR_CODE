Becca Levan,Over sized and Neck line too big!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S6LZUQCND4D2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DPKGX4T3,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 21, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: Red,Verified Purchase,The sizes are quite big and the fact that it takes forever to receive is another issue. I loved the fabric it’s thin and not to heavy. The neck is really big too but found a matching spots bra that could be warn with it. I also took one of my other shirts and laid it on top of it and re-sewed up the sides so it fits better more like the picture advertised. I had to put in some extra work that should not have been but I can now wear it and enjoy it better.,2
