Not really tunic length, but long enough to wear with jeans or dress pants whether tucked or loose. Overall, this is a stylish and attractive shirt that makes a great addition to my wardrobe.

I usually wear between a L and XL, and I wanted something a little roomy so I ordered up.  It fits fine, but not as roomy as I expected.  If you are between sizes, perhaps order up if you prefer a loose fit.  I looked it over, and the seams are all even and well sewn.  The fabric is soft and comfortable.  It really is a basic tshirt, but the neckline detail dresses it up.  I would order this again, and in additional colors.",

I have a bit of a mommy belly and this shirt hides it pretty well.  I like that the detailing is attached at both ends so the straps lay flat and don't easily twist.  The only drawback to this type of shirt, is if you spend a lot of time in the sun, you will have an interesting tan line.  After several washes, it retains its shape and its color nicely.  The material feels nice and doesn't pill. For under $20 you can't ask for a better shirt.  Definitely a good choice.",
