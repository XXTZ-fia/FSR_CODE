I washed mine too and it just seems like a dress shirt with fewer buttons. I might return it, I might not.  I guess I will wear it a bit more and see if it will adjust with time? I forget what these shirts are called but I have another one like it that is exactly what I suspected this to be like, ironically, I got what I wanted for free at an apartment showing and the one I paid for (above) is not what it is sort of advertised as. Maybe 3/4 sleeve loose fit? Either way, I didn't get what I was expecting but maybe I expected something different than what was apparent.",

First wash, no change with just detergent. After researching, I used detergent and a half cup of baking soda, just the pants I mentioned and the shirt, large load and extra rinse. The smell will transfer to other clothing if you add them. Then I air dried them. It seems to have helped.",

I have a bunch in several different colors. The fit and feel are perfect, as always. However, the pink in the pictures is not the pink I got. The pink in the pictures is a faded, pastel pink. The pink I got was much more of a vivid salmon, saturated color with some orange to it. It doesn’t really fit the feel of the beachy yoga shirt I wanted. I’m going to do what I can to fade it out to the color I was hoping for, the color in the listing’s pictures.  Again, though, the shirts themselves are great. I know some folks don’t like how “wrinkled” they look. If you’re looking for a wrinkleless shirt, don’t buy one made of cotton and linen. That said, they don’t hold wrinkles any longer than anything else. The fabric is thick enough that most wrinkles will fall out of it after a few minutes of wear. But it’s thin enough to be comfy in warm weather. If you’re looking for a casual, comfy, and fashionable shirt in this style, look no further. If you’re looking for a plastic shirt that can be wadded up in a suitcase and then thrown on with a suit and tie and be wrinkle-free, keep on scrolling. But why would you be looking for that kind of shirt in a yoga shirt listing?",6
