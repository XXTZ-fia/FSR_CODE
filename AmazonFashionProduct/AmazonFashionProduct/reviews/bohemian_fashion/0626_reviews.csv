These pants are made for short women as you can see from the photo i took. If i step up or sit down they ride all the way up my calves and it’s not very comfortable. My calves are big cause i go to the gym so it squeezes my leg. Material is cheap and blurry and instead of a soft kind of multi color it’s more like somebody threw up on me.
