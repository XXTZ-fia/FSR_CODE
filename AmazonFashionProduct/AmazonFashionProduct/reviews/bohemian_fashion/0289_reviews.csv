It was very light weight and even though it has sleeves they are very thin and breathable, can see through them. It was a comfy dress but my only two complaints where the sleeves were an odd length where they didn’t reach my wrists all the way and if I reached forward they pulled back and the issue with that was the wrists are tight elastic, not horribly tight but I also have super tiny wrists as it is. I am five foot and and ordered the small. I like the elastic keeps the wrist in place but it could have mayeb bene more comfy or the sleeves mad longer so there was more reach. There is also a cute opening at the midsection but it’s hidden by the huge bow. Do to my build I did have to wear a tank brawl cami under it as other bras would be seen due to the low cut, but depending on others you may not need a bra if as the model picture for it, but there is no padding in the top so if you wanted that some sticky covers would work great!

The material is so light on the skin and not sheer so it won’t show your private parts.

It does arrive up super wrinkly so be prepared to wash it a couple times and possibly put it in a bra bag in the dryer to get out those last few pesky wrinkles. For those of us ladies without big boobies it does tie pretty tight in the front but I recommend getting some body tape to hold your girlies up in place since it won’t support them. Super light weight dress so it’s great to wear during the summer heat and very flattering. Will be purchasing more in additional colors😊,9
