So it's a slip over your head dress. The waistline has no stretch. I don't know about others, but my bust size is bigger than my waist size. I tried to get it on over my head, but couldn't get the waistline over my bust. I returned. So, if your bust is bigger than your waistline, I'd think twice about ordering the 3/4 sleeve. It's cute, but impossible to get on.",3
