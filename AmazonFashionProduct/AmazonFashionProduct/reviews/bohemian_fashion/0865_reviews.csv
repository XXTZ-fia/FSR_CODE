Taylor Ryan,Cute but used,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JWRC2M0RD9W3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGWXLD9X,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Dark Brown,Verified Purchase,"Let me start this review by saying the dress itself is super cute and fits great! However, I was disappointed by the fact that I received a used dress instead of a new one. At a price point of almost $60, I would expect to receive a new dress as advertised. Not only is there a hole in the pocket but there was a “Sweet Baby Ray’s” napkin left in said pocket by whoever wore it last. :-/ I would rate the dress itself 5 stars but the overall experience a 3.",

First in the “Purple” and “Cream” colors - pictures included. The coloring was just wayyyy off from what was shown in the product description pictures. The flowers on the purple dress are bright red. The flowers on the cream dress were a bright green - not at all what I was wanting unfortunately. I returned those two & took a chance and ordered the “Beige” color, thankfully that one actually came in looking like the color pictured! I loved the neutral look of it and wore for my baby shower at 30 weeks pregnant. Size medium fit great. I’m 5’5 & normally 150lb, currently at 180 & it was comfortable and looked great - can’t wait to wear it after pregnancy as well! Another downside was how wrinkled this fabric is. You will definitely want to steam before wearing. Made a huge difference for my dress. Of the 3 I ordered - they were all a bit see through but the “cream” color was by far the most see through! I just wore pregnancy spanx under my dress but would have liked to have a slip ideally. I think it’s a little pricey for what it is (kinda cheaply made, may not hold up super well) but nothing ships faster than an amazon dress and I’m always looking for these things at the last minute, so it was worth it for me!",13

The picture makes it look a tad dressier than it actually styles. It's got a gauze look to it which in my opinion lends to a more casual feel than dressy.

After reading so many reviews and looking at the different product photos, there seemed to be 2 different variations of this beige dress- one being with just white skinnier flowers and one with the darker beige and cream.  I was over the moon to receive the beige with the darker and cream flowers. I’m 5 ft and 99 lbs. A size small fits like a glove. It is slightly long and a bit more heavier on the bottom than the top, but so flowy and flattering.  The sleeves are indeed short, but that adds a level of flirt that I love. The dress is great quality for the price, although I’d probably hand wash and air dry to really withstand time and avoid shrinkage. The price and quality seems reasonable, as long as you’re aware this isn’t meant to be a daily wear dress and you’re paying for that handful of special wears with a lot of compliments.  Overall, it’s a very functional dress. I wore it for family photos, my birthday, and will probably wear it again for thanksgiving! Also, shipment arrived exactly when it said it would!",9

They aren't huge and I didn't notice them until I was searching since this was in other reviews as a complaint. There are also some small threads hanging from the flowers and seams here and there. If this was a $20 dress I'd say it was great, but at $55 it absolutely is not worth the money for the quality. I worry it will get ruined in the wash even on delicate, or snag one of the small holes super easily and be just a couple-time-wear dress... which should not be the case for the price.
