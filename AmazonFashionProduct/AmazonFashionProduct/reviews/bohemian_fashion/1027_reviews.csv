(I'm going to call it a dress, here.) I already bought one for my cousin, but a different design. It's perfect. I love almost everything about it. It gets so hot here, and I detest heat - hate it. This will be something I can throw on for around the house that will keep me covered up and cool - well, as much as any clothing  can, I guess. The only thing I don't like about it is, that it is made of viscose. That's rayon, and usually rayon that likes to shrink. I haven't washed it yet, as I've only tried it on and pranced around my room once, then hung it back up. I'll definitely wash it on cold/delicate, and hang dry - by itself, the first few times. If you get one and it's wrinkled out of the package, the wrinkles will fall out after a couple of days on the hanger. Rayon doesn't like heat or irons - especially the stretchy stuff that's all over, online. I wouldn't tackle this one with an iron, but I have a ton of clothes made from this stuff. While I do try to avoid viscose whenever possible, I'll probably come back here for another dress in a different pattern. The colors are vibrant and pretty. 5 stars.",3

I am a full figured size 3x woman and this fits great the only thing I do not care for at all is that the sides of this are literally sewn together with one single line of thread, there is no double stitching. There is also zero stretch to this, which is fine if you are super careful but as a fuller woman I can promise you this will tear super easy and super quick if i happen to sit incorrectly just one time in this.

It washed and dried very well (I even threw it in the dryer, oops) and there wasn't any noticeable shrinkage. The only minor gripe I have about this dress is that the fabric is one sided, meaning the print is on one side of the fabric, but it's white on the other.
