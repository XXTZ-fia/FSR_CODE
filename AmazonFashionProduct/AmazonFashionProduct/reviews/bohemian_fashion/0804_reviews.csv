The material of the black ones felt almost like tissue paper and the pockets stuck out awkwardly - I’ll be returning them. The blue ones were obviously worn and returned, since I found a used tissue in one of the pockets when trying them on. Yuck. But I’m going to keep them and will wear after I wash them. They are very lightweight and flowy, and the fabric is pretty thin but softer than the black ones. Not sure how they’ll hold up after a wash, but I plan to hand wash and air dry them to lessen the risk of them ripping or shrinking.",

These are a nice soft fabric and can be dressed up (with high heels and a dressy blouse) or down (with flat sandals and a casual top) depending on need. While I bought a size medium which fits close to ""true to size"", time will tell whether washing causes them to shrink. If you like a little more room, recommend you compare your measurements to the size chart and buy one size up from what the chart indicates will fit you. The waist measurements for Medium and Large overlap quite a bit, so you may have to compare your hip measurement to see which will give you the fit you want. Keep in mind the waist will look small when you first open the package and unfold them, but it is very stretchy.",

I did go up one size because I'm taller (5'10"") and wanted them to be both baggy and long enough. This worked out well -- they fit great! I especially love the smocked waist. I carry most of my weight in my butt/thighs, so your mileage may vary, but the waist in these pants hugs my tummy well enough that the pants stay up without digging into my abdomen and being uncomfortable. Also, no bulky or annoying drawstring tie.  I've washed them about a dozen times so far on cold and hung them to dry. No shrinkage or significant wrinkling.  The fabric is lightweight enough that I think they could be somewhat see-through in a lighter, solid color. However, with darker colors/fun patterns, that is not the case (I've asked friends to check in full sunlight, and they report no see-through issues).  I loved my first pair so much that I've since ordered two more pairs so that I can live in them all summer long!",7
