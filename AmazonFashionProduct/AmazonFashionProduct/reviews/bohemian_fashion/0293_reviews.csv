The petal sleeves look nice, but the white inside is visible when moving your arms. The front is slightly longer than the back, which is good because the bustline pulls up the front hem to make the hems close to even when worn (the front is still slightly shorter than the back when wearing it).  The pleats release about 2 inches past the peak of the bust, so the waist and hemline are very loose. I would prefer that the pleats were released 2"" above the peak of the bust so that the released fabric would proved better shaping. As it is, there are large folds of fabric along the side of the bust and the side seam is being pulled toward the front near the bustline, resulting in a pooling of fabric at the small of the back.  The seams are all overlocked and the hems are single-folded and coverstitched. Some of the fabric extends beyond the coverstitching on the inside and you can see that the edges were not trimmed straight in all places. The front pleats were chain stitched.",3

The listing suggests it's a summer top, but I plan on wearing it year-round (especially if I pair it with a cardigan or shrug).The fabric is a very soft and comfortable 95% polyester and 5% spandex, so there's some stretch to it.  It's machine washable, but the seller recommends hand washing and hang drying.  Comes in a multitude of styles/colors, so you're sure to find one that suits you (I chose the one identified as bf 101).The listing price of $22.99 seems decent for the style, fabric, and flattering fit.",

The green color is not so vivid as to be gaudy, but is more a foliage green color.  The fabric is so soft and feels so nice against your skin.  I am 5’ 1” so the neckline is a bit low on me, bit still wearable without being revealing.  The petal sleeve design is lovely; I would have preferred the sleeves to be slightly longer, but I am a senior and am developing “old lady arms”.  The top is true-to-size; I would have liked extra small, the size I normally wear which was not available, but small is not so large as to be unwearable.  Since this is a tunic top, the extra room is not obvious or distracting.  You will love this design if you choose it.",

I love the floral colors and flowers and the cut of the sleeves and bottom. I will have to be careful with washing because they recommend hand washing and air drying rather than machine drying. The material is so thin and delicate that I don't think it would survive many machine washes. I love this top so I will care for it so that it lasts a long time.",
