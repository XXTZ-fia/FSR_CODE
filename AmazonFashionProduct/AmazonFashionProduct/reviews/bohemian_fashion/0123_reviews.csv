I ordered L & M. The M actually fits better. I am 5’0” 156#.  I carry most of my weight in my arms & thighs. I do not wear padded bras, 40C. I am curvy shaped, overweight hourglass. I bought several tops for a trip through the Panama Canal. Many of these ports are so hot, I wanted loose tops. It skims my body without clinging. The fabric is soft. I like the embroidery front & upper back. There are no loose threads. I prefer off white colors, but this top has enough blues & grays in the embroidery that it doesn’t make me look washed out. This is one of several different tops I purchased this was the only  Med. The others I purchased large or extra large based on other people’s ratings. It is helpful to know height & weight and body shape and the size purchased. I hope my review helps you.",
