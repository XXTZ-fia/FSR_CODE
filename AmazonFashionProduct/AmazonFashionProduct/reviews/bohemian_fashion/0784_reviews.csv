Ordered this dress and the same exact one with long sleeves for an engagement party, the short sleeve one was gorgeous and I would've kept it but the wait band was huge, it must've been a mistake made in making the dress... I ordered both dresses in a small, I tried on the long sleeve version and it fit well at the waist (same maker and size as the first, ??) but the sleeves were just really big and long for me, I am on the smaller side. I gave this product as many stars as I did despite that weird sizing/stitching/fitting only bc it was literally the easiest and quickest return process ever. No box required, dropped them at UPS, in like twelve hours they issued me my full refund. What I will say about these dresses too is this, you can't tell in the photos how well made they are in terms of material. I was mostly impressed with them.",

I am 5'3"" and weigh 127 lbs. I am a 36B/C cup. Measurements 37, 30, 39. For me, at age 59, it is perfect. I could have worn a Small as the waist is a little loose, but it's not Baggy or sloppy and i like to feel comfortable. The length is perfect, tea length for flats or heels. I read some reviews about the tie looking poorly in the front?? The tie goes on the back! You can adjust the depth of the neckline with these ties. If I tie it completely closed it brings the neckline up more modest. The picture shows the straps tied leaving about a 5 inch gap. If you wanted more cleavage just leave a larger distance between the panels when you tie the back straps. I purchased a lavender slip from amazon seller Ekouaer for $14.99. Description Women's Nightgown Satin Slip Dress Sexy Lingerie Sleepwear Long Slip Silk Midi Dress Spaghetti Strap in size Medium. It is silk, not satin, so it isnt shiny. Its soft and lightweight. Lavender matches the purple dress perfectly, but could be used under any color dress (without lace panels). The slip lines the dress in the breast area, allowing braless or extra bra coverage. It's long enough to line to the lower, 2nd lace panel. The straps on the Slip are shoulder ties which allowed me to adjust the height of the slips neckline, so it would not show. I just tied a knot in each of the 2 straps where the back strap attaches to the back of the slip. I plan to wear this to my nieces outdoor wedding. I sent the bride a picture for approval and she loves it. I plan to order an ombre long scarf as a jacket for the evening reception. I ordered some colorful cream, lavender, purple and pink patent pumps but unsure if that will work. If not I will probably order nude, eggplant, deep maroon, ox blood or aubergine color pumps. This shade of purple is light, powdery, making it so versitile. I will coordinate my purse & jewelry once I have the shoes figured out, to tie the two colors together. I hope my review helps others make the best choice in size & color. I am very pleased with my Amazon purchase.",26
