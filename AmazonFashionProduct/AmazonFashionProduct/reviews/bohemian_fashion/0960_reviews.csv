I bought the smaller of the two sizes available (both are one size, one is a larger one size). The cotton is thicker than I'd expected, the pants weren't wrinkly at all, and the front pocket has a zipper! I'm short (5'2"") and curvy and I was a little worried these were going to be either too big or too tight around the mid-section, but they fit perfectly. I think it's because the back has a lot of elastic ruching so it can fit a variety of sizes, while the front is a nice thick flat fabric panel, so it's flattering while still comfortable.  I plan to wear this to a desert music festival and think it'll be breathable, while super cute and comfy!  Highly recommend,",

Usually I find a pair I like but when I check the measurements I don't even bother ordering because they won't fit. After looking at reviews and the recommended size guidelines for these I decided to order a pair and I absolutely love them. If you carry a little more weight in your hips/waist just double check the size guide and order based on that, they arrived as described. They would probably be a little longer in length for a slimmer person or when worn lower on the hips - but that's true for most pants when you're both tall and in the plus size range and I didn't find the length to change the look I was going for.  The fabric and stitching create beautiful statement, the material isn't thin and doesn't feel like it will wear out after only a few uses. I was worried they might be too hot for summer but unlike some cotton pants they breathe and even with active movement I stayed cool even though temps are 100+ degrees right now. The waist has just enough elastic to be comfortable while still offering some support. First time out and I got multiple compliments and just enjoyed wearing them so much that I've already ordered a second pair with a different print. I'll style these for live events as well as having them stashed for changing into when late nights turn into sunrise chill time.",6

These pants well exceeded my expectations in terms of craftsmanship and the way that they feel. They are incredibly breathable, are made of cotton, and have a zipper pocket that is really deep, you can store quite a lot in there. They have quickly become my new favorite pants. The front appears flat against your belly, but the back half of the pants that goes against your back has an elastic that hugs and form fits your body. My only wish is that they came in a slightly smaller size, I'm taller and a bit on the slim side, And they begin to stretch out and fall down a little bit over time. When I wash them again they shrink right back up. Highly recommend buying these pants, you won't be disappointed.
