Ash Rowan,Sizing was disappointing…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K5HDV9EC7LFK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6WHPHLT,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I’m an xxl, 2x, and 3x depending on the make of the garment, usually ending up in the smaller sizes. I rarely have to size up anymore.  I could get this on but it was tight across my belly and hips. Which was surprising since most items in this size fit me almost perfectly. If you normally size up to have more breathing room, and you usually wear an xxl, this will def be too small. I also wish the liner had slits on the side as well, for ease of moment but it doesn’t. I know the neck is high but it’s just a touch too high for comfort. I am about 15/20lbs too big for this xxl, when I normally don’t have an issue with wearing this size because of how my weight carries. I will be keeping this dress and using it as a before and after in my weight loss journey. It’s pretty and I don’t want to part with it.",
