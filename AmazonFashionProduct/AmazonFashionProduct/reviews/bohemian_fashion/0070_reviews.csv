The reason I took off a star from this review is because the sweater is just slightly larger than I would have liked. I ordered a medium, and usually wear a size small/medium in other sweaters, depending on how I want them to fit. Because I wanted this to be kind of oversized, I ordered a medium. However, when it came it I realized it's probably a bit TOO oversized and regretted getting a medium. If you want a overused fit, I suggest staying true to your usual sizing because the sweater itself runs large. Otherwise, I love the look of this sweater. The material is very comfy and lightweight, and it looks super beachy.",
