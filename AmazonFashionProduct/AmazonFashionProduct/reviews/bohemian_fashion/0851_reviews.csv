I was a little panicked when I got the package because it showed a pair of Palazzo pants. Go ahead and open the package because it'll be what you ordered. This skirt is as fine the quality as one that I've paid three times the price for. Enjoy.,

As a skirt, though, it's nearly perfect.  Mine arrived late, so I'm returning it and won't be able to answer questions about durability or washability.
