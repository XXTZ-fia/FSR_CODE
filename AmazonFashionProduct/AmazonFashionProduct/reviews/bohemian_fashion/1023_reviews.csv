However, this fabric is a little different. The black picked up every single piece of hair, lint dust, and anything else you can think of and held onto it like Velcro. I wound up just donating it. I loved the original one so much, that I actually ordered another patterned one. It is just as great as the first one. I guess the black one is just made out of a different material that’s not great. They wash really well too! I just hang them up to dry.",

It's my new favorite summer go-to.  It flows and doesn't cling to my stomach and waist. It has pockets which is always a plus. It has washed well however it has shrunk in length, which isn't a problem for me since I am short, but I also dried it on low heat which the tag advises against. I am not taking a star away for that since it was my fault it shrunk. I do wish the dress was a little cheaper in cost because I would definitely order more if it was.",
