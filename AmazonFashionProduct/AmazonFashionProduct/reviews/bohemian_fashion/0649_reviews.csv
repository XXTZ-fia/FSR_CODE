I bought this to wear during autumn and winter because of the picture. I absolutely love the embroidered details. Absolutely beautiful!  What I don’t like is that this top is incredibly thin. As you can see in my last photo, it’s quite see through. Fortunately it didn’t show my bra or skin since the top was a dark blue, but if you get a lighter color that’s something to think about before buying if it matters to you. I honestly like the top, but unfortunately I won’t be able to wear it part of autumn and during winter without layering.",20
