Debster,"I Lovely skirt , soft, may need extra care.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG7UBR7XOVBIO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08RB77BR4,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",,Verified Purchase,It arrived wrapped really nicely in pretty paper inside a pretty box.  Check the sizing chart. One size does not actually fit all. The fabric is soft and thin but I do not believe it is thin enough to see through.  The rope like threading separating the squares has a lot of loose threads The colors are not going to be what you see in the listing pictures but it’s still very nice looking.  Mine is tight for me but i like the skirt so much I was going to keep it and just fix the loose threads as I find them ( tuck them in or sew them into place) but then I found that 4 of the 5 elephant print squares were damaged . There is a frayed line across them that I know will end up as tears.  Giving the skirt 4 stars because it’s really nice on the eyes and to the touch but may require extra maintenance to keep it from turning into a thready mess.,

Chelsea,"Bad quality, putrid smell, small waist, not what I was expecting.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROG85VQ6TRF98/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08RB77BR4,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 12, 2024",Color: Coca Mocha,,"Okay so I bought the green one at first, it came with some flaws but had beautiful colours. So, I ordered another but in ""beige"" I was aware of the variation in colours and the size from already buying a green skirt, however, this beige skirt came absolutely poorly made. The waist is way smaller than the other skirt, its too tight although it has some stretch to it. The fabric itself is nice and lightweight & flowy, just like the other skirt. Heres the thing. The seams are literally busting, it has a PUTRID smell of chemicals that hasnt come out even after a couple washes, and the colour is not what I wanted at all. The seams have a ton of loose thread and if you pull them the whole patch will fall apart, the thread is also extremely easy to break and get caught on things when wearing. Like I said, I am aware of the variation in colours but I did not expect to recieve a FULLY RED skirt. I expected some red, majority brown, maybe some black, and I was even prepared for the possibility of blue in it too. The skirt I got is extremely disappointing and I do hope to get a refund for this purchase. Now onto size, I'm 5'4"" and the skirt is a bit too long. I have to wear it up to my ribs and above my waist in order to not step on it. If I were to wear it on my waist, it would be way too tight and leave marks too. My hips are a size 32(usually in men's shorts) and my waist is just a few inches taken in from my hip size. I weigh 175 pounds for reference. For those who want to buy the beige colour, dont waste your money on a gamble. I had very little problems with the Olive Green colour so I suggest buying that one instead.",

Ley C.,REAL Patchwork - Beautiful but not Perfect - Plan to get Another One,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKTBG3XS72NS1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08RB77BR4,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2023",Color: Beige,Verified Purchase,"I got the ""beige"" and I LOVE IT! You need to keep an open mind with this one, but if you like unique and you appreciate the real patchwork design, you'll probably love it too.  This is not sheer at all but there is no lining. To be safe, I'll wear a slip, even though you could probably get away without one. The waist is elastic so that will stretch. The rest of it is not stretchy, but there is plenty of room. I could probably fit another person in my skirt. I'm 5'3 and weigh around 128 pounds. My hips are 40-1/2 inches, waist 30 inches.  Each skirt is a little different, so yours is not going to look exactly like the photos, but it will look ""similar"" with the ""same color scheme."" I think this is really cool!! The patchwork design is 100% real, not a ridiculous looking print.  All that being said, you need to accept some things. There is one size. Therefore, I took a photo to show the size of the waist on the one I received. The waist is elastic so it's going to stretch a lot, but it's still nice to have a guideline. I have a 30 inch waist and it fits very snug at the waist, not to the point where it's uncomfortable, but if my waist was just a little bit larger I think it could be a slightly painful. The hem is a little wonky. Actually, it's not even and it's actually unraveling in one spot, so I'm going to have to redo the hem myself so it hangs properly. The stitching on the patchwork looks like it may have been done with embroidery floss...it looks really neat to me, but it's sort of erratic.  There is no washing/care label on the skirt. Because of the somewhat loose looking stitches on the patchwork, I washed it on the delicate cycle in the machine, and it came out OK, but I will hand wash it moving forward to be safe. Now I'm gonna order another one :-)",11

However, the all of threads on the outside of the dress that are part of the design are loose, meaning they’re not tied in. It’s easy to get the threads snagged on and pulled out. And since I’m short (usually a size 8P), I have to fold the waistband a couple of times, but that’s not an issue at all. All in all, you buy this, you have to be careful about not getting snagged, or you’ll have to put the thick thread under each loop (which I had to do by hand).",5
