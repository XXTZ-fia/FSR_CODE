The color was better than expected. But things changed once I opened it and tried it on.  Not only was it several inches shorter than the exact same top/sweater I’ve bought in different prints from this company, it had a huge hole/split in one of the seams. The seam was stitched so close to the edge, it was impossible for me to repair, so it was returned. Sad face #1.  I would have chosen “replace with exact same item”, and have it another chance, but that option wasn’t offered. Sad face #2.  The return was free, but not as easy as one expects on Amazon these days. One, I had to print USPS labels (I don’t have a printer at home or have access to one at work). I also had to repack and tape it up myself (had to buy tape) - for a defective product (they should’ve handled it). Sad face #3.  In addition, my return never registered on Amazon (it kept directing me to print my return label, after I’d mailed it). I had to message the seller for my refund with proof of the return being delivered to them (tracking was clear), 6 days after they received it. My refund did then show up quickly, but prompting shouldn’t be necessary. Sad face #4.  What a headache.
