Amazon Customer,Neckline very open,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E2U9SO4UKW1K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2WGMD2K,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 18, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Dots Black,,"I'm giving this a 4. It's cute. It is as pictured. It fit as expected. Really like the pattern and the colors. The material is on the thinner side but acceptable to wear in public. It was comfortable. It stretches. Where I have an issue is thick neckline, I like showing the girls a lot more than most people, but this was too wide for me. Some of that is caused by me needing a size to fit my bottom half results in a size too large on my top half. I can usually solve this by adding a stich to the neckline, but since this dress is a true wrap and not a faux wrap, it would need to be sewn and removed every time it is worn.",
CJ,Awesome gift!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E31J1YQ0518Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2WGMD2K,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 6, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Green Red Floral,,"I gifted the Women's Purses Handbags Designer Fashion Top Handle Tweed Beaded Chain Pearl Evening Satchel Shoulder Bag Crossbody to my wife, and she absolutely loves it! The elegant design, combining PU leather and tweed, along with the gold hardware and pearl accents, gives it a sophisticated and classy look. It's perfect for various occasions, from casual dates to formal events.  The bag is compact yet spacious enough to hold essentials like a wallet, phone, and makeup. Its adjustable chain strap allows versatility in how it's carried. The craftsmanship is impressive, with high-quality materials and neat stitching. This purse has quickly become one of my wife's favorites, adding a touch of luxury to her collection.",
Doug Hibbard,Beautiful and Comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LRB5X3A9T0CA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2WGMD2K,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 22, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Blue Orange Floral,,"My wife loves this dress! She has several similarly patterned dresses for the cooler seasons, and she frequently grabs them as soon as the temperatures dip low enough to wear them. So, she was excited to have one that was in a summer style. She said it's a very comfortable dress that lays well and keeps her cool. The sizing is a little odd. It runs small compared to other dresses, but this is all laid out in the sizing chart. My wife said she loved the way the bodice fits and the neckline falls, but the way the wrap comes together at the waist feels a little off. Fortunately, the vibrant pattern hides any of the ""offness,"" and it doesn't feel uncomfortable. It was just a little awkward for my wife to get it tied well. She also said it has to be tied in the back, and she highly prefers a side or front bow to avoid the knot hitting her in the back when she sits. Other than that, though, she loves the dress.",
Kayla Pia,Very nice and worth the money.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IL3ZL4TYMK6X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2WGMD2K,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 10, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Blue Orange Floral,,Very nice and worth the money.,

It is a wraparound design. It’s black in color with tiny beige flowers. It does fit me perfect so it is true to size. The lightweight material of this dress is perfect for the hot summer days. I will be wearing this to an outside wedding in a few weeks. The dress is figure flattering and very comfortable. This is a very cute, affordable dress. I’m very pleased with the quality and style of this dress.",2
LKodat,Make note that this is a wrap dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1G428UA72WHHR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2WGMD2K,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 24, 2024",,,"I didn't pay close enough attention when ordering and wasn't expecting a wrap dress, but no harm, no foul. I figured out how to put it on correctly - the tie goes in the back, not the front - and gave it a whirl for church. I like the pattern, but as others have noted, the material is on the thinner side, but not so much that you can see through it or anything. The coverage in front is okay, but I did have to safety pin the bust to not show too much cleavage, and I think the length was a little awkward for me. I'm 5'9"" and it hit somehow mid shin, I would have liked it to be just a little bit shorter. The day wasn't windy when I wore it, but that's always a caution when wearing a wrap dress, so a slip is a good companion. I will say that they need to get a better translator for their tag descriptions, my husband and I had a good laugh deciphering what they meant to say.",2
Julia,SO gorgeous,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSHRV1MRUDPTI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2WGMD2K,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 21, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Pink Floral,,"I am actually so pleasantly surprised with this dress! I got the pink floral print to try and the detail on the dress is so cute and much more beautiful than I thought it'd be. The flowers look like small cherry blossoms, and the light pink on the entire dress is the perfect shade. So nice and flowy for the summer, would absolutely recommend!",2
MrCharisma,I love this dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBBZHOPA91JSA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2WGMD2K,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 19, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Green Red Floral,,This dress fit me perfectly!  I am 5’9” and 145 lbs and it fit me in all the right places.  The length was just below the knee and the material is very lightweight and flowing.  The material covers the bust area well without showing too much.  I was a bit confused in thinking that the tie was on the side but realized it is in the back.  Not a fan of that but not a big deal for me.  Love the print and color!,

It looks just like the photo, the pattern is beautiful, and the dress is comfortable and classy. The only downside is that the fabric feels a bit cheap and flimsy. There is no stretch at all. It also might blow up on the wind, but that is to be expected with a wrap dress.",

I would prefer to tie it in the front, but that is not an option. With these really short strings. You would be able to tie it in the back. Even if I take it to the side, one of the pieces is really short. I can make it work, but that sure is annoying.  Overall the dress is very pretty. I think it runs a little small.",

Yamille Roman,Runs small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GP6SVB5TNO0R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2WGMD2K,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 9, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Leopard Pattern,,This is supposed to be a 2xl but it fits smaller like a lg/xl. The front doesn't close over my chest so I will have to wear it slip dress underneath and leave top slightly open. The material is thin which is good for summer but bad for the fluffy areas so spanks or faja are a must. This dress good double as a bathing suit cover. I do not like the straps that you need to keep the dress close as they are too short and stay at my back. I would recommend making these longer on the bigger sizes so that it makes a nice side tie.,
The Countess,True wrap,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R365KWOMPHBHE6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2WGMD2K,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 6, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Dots Black,,Wanted a polka dot dress and ordered this one .  The dress is a true wrap dress. I am disappointed that there aren’t a few buttons inside so it will stay in place better. I have owned a couple of wrap dresses which had buttons discreetly placed inside at the waist to help keep it on. I will have to pin this one.  The dress is nicely lightweight for summer. And the polka dots are perfect.,
