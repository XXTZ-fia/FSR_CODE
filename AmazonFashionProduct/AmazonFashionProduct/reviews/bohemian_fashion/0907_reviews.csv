However, I was in search of a pant option for my upcoming travel to hot, humid weather. These pants broke me, and I have no regrets. I didn't love that the inside pant leg was longer than the outside layer and because I opted for the Large, the legs were a tad too voluminous and billowy. I took to my sewing machine, chopped 5 inches off the inside layer and put a small stitch to the outside layers, just below the pocket, to smooth down the sides. They are now more like capris and I absolutely love them. The pants are now a 5 for me but I rated a 4 because it did require some work to get it just right.",
