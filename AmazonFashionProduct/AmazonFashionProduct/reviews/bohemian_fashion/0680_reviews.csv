Endyblue,Lovely light dress for warm summer days ~,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA84ZR2ROSYG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNK3C8KK,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Color: 01 WhiteSize: Large,,"This is such a cute little dress and I will happily wear it this spring is summer.  It *is* thin so one can choose to wear it as-is, or follow my lead and wear another tank dress under it for coverage.  I wore this with leggings and a lovely long sweater for colder-weather wear.  It seems to be made well and I might even get another pattern or two.  Enjoy.",
Angel,Made well,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU17ZDYQZTLG7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNK3C8KK,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Color: Blue Floral 01Size: XX-Large,,"It is made well with no loose threads and soft poly blend fabric. Jersey type feel but no stretch whatsoever.  It is a very straight piece so it there is no curve to your body the dress looks pretty plain.  It was tight on my upper arms when I pull forward so I would say it runs a tad on the small side or made to fit less ""built"" woman as it was also tight on my bum.",
Kyann,Love this dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUZVCE0GYKT5M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNK3C8KK,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Color: 01 ApricotSize: X-Large,,"This beach dress is so cute on.  I chose my size based on the chest size.  Since I'm larger busted, I went up one size, and it fits perfectly.  I like that it is more of an A-line dress and not straight.  It fits my bottom so much better.  The material is 100% viscose and it is so nice and soft.  It's machine washable, but I think I would hang to dry.  It's a very comfortable dress and would look great with a pair of sandals.  I would highly recommend!",
Tante L,Order up a size if you want loose. Not cotton like the traditional dresses in this style.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33CFNI0ETPQ0P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNK3C8KK,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Color: 01 ApricotSize: Large,,"I usually wear a M or L in tops or dresses- this Large ""just"" fits so I would say it runs a bit small. It's the shoulders and upper arms that seem on the small/slim side. The length is good and sizing through the hip is fine. I will be taking care not to put in dryer to insure I don't shrink it. This dress is very similar to the thin cotton Indian dresses I used to get 20 years ago or more- but this one is viscose rather than cotton. Still breathable but is sort of shiny and likely won't fade the same as the vintage cotton ones from India. Honestly I would prefer the thin cotton 'old school' version of these dresses but I just don't see them anymore so this one will do.",
Samantha Renee Campbell,Nice,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R398N5EF3OJCWK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNK3C8KK,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Color: GreenSize: XX-Large,,"This Boho Summer Dress is just okay to me.  It is well made, the material is good but the pattern/design is not so great to me.  It did not look like what I ordered.  In addition to me not caring for the design, it did not fit quite as well as I would have hoped.  This particular dress is not one that I would wear outside the house but it is perfect for me for around the house.  I use it as a night gown.",
Julie Paulk,THIN AND FITS WIERD,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NY1ZAWAK15BV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNK3C8KK,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: 01 WhiteSize: XX-Large,,"NOT A FAN AT ALL. THE MATERIAL IS SUPER THIN AND IT HAS A VERY ODD FIT TO IT. (ALSO, SIZE UP.) IT SITS WIERD IN THE FRONT AND IN THE ARMS, WHICH THE ARMS ARE SMALL FITTED TOO. IT'S A CUTE DESIGN, BUT NOT A GREAT EXECUTION.",
Valerie,So cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ9F1HP6FXAJ3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNK3C8KK,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: RedSize: XX-Large,,"This dress is so cute...I love the pattern.

OrangeCatKevin,Cute design but not the most flattering,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXQ2QUAT3MXYU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNK3C8KK,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Color: 01 WhiteSize: Large,,"I will definitely use this as a beach cover up and not as a dress.  I am 5’2” and about 155 lbs, and I ordered a size L.  It fits fine, but it kinda sits like a tent or a moo moo on me.  It’s nice quality fabric and the design is very pretty, I just wish it was slightly more form fitting to be flattering.",
Dioscuri,Very comfortable and cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV8KTBU3JZ2LQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNK3C8KK,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Medium,,"Very cute beach summer dress.

Bonnie,Dress Up or Dress Casual - Love this little boho dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18P61953Q2BMT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNK3C8KK,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Color: RedSize: Large,,"What a fun little dress.  I ordered size Lg.  I’m 5’7 ½” and 167 lbs.  I carry most of my weight below my waist.  The large fit perfectly.  If you are evenly distributed or between sizes, you may wish to order on the smaller size.  I used the steamer to remove wrinkles; worked great.  I love the gathering on the sleeves.  Design is great and looks good on me. Everything seems well sewn.  You could dress this up or dress it very casual with flip-flops (my style).  The red is more of a rose-red; it looks fabulous with the black accents.  Love it!",
Happy Grandma,I love it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4GHAV0PHYXGY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNK3C8KK,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Color: 02 ApricotSize: X-Large,,"As soon as I put this on, I knew it would become a “favorite” or “go to” piece of apparel.  The material is smooth almost slinky feeling. The fit is perfect.  Feels as though it was made for me only!  I’m more than pleased with this coverup.  It can go anywhere and be appropriate whether it’s through a hotel lobby or local restaurant. Length and sleeve length are perfect.  I’m shorter than most so I can really appreciate a proper fit.  Order your regular size and it’ll be perfect.  Washes well and hang dries without wrinkles.",
Customer007,Very Pretty,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HNWYY1P2DHMX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNK3C8KK,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Color: RedSize: Medium,,"I'm reviewing the Zeagoo Womens Boho Summer Dress with 3/4 sleeves.  This dress has a tassel tie at the neck, the fabric is 100% Viscose and it feels smooth, when I rub the fabric with my fingers it feels like fine cotton.  The main color is muted Red (it's in between Pantone 192 and Pantone 193 color), the prints are crisp, no over-printing and the entire dress has a pleasing color combination.  I'm 5'4"" at 115 lbs and it fitted me well.  It has clean stitching and no loose threads.  I would wash in cold water and hang dry (to preserve the size).",
JLG,Very cute dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFPVJJ30OF0JP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNK3C8KK,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Color: 01 WhiteSize: Medium,,"This dress is actually really adorable. It's a lightweight fabric perfect for summer but not thin enough to be see through. It fits true to size and is generous through the hips. The pattern is really pretty I got the 'white'. My only complaint is that it has a little but of a chemical smell when new, but I'm sure that will go away with the first washing.",
