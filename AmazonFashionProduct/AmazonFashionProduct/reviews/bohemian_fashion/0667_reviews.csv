I bought it for a trip that would be hot and humid. It was perfect. However they did show that this could also be used a dress. I found that to be a bit awkward since the ties were in a weird spot and leaving them hanging seemed weird to me. So I just used it as a skirt. I think the item was as expected. I am happy with the purchase.,

First, the stretchy ruched “top” of the dress is a great length hitting just above my pouch of a tummy then flowing into the skirt. The ties can be tied in front or back for a cute strapless look, up and behind the neck as shown in images, crossed in front behind neck. It’s thin but quality cotton fabric. The stitching at the bottom is pretty simple and I do foresee it fraying if you drag it on the ground. The darker colors are not see through (you can see shapes if a light is behind you, but not the color or coverage of panties). I can’t speak on the lighter colors. It’s breezy and breathable.
