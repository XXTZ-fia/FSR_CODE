The color is stunning—rich and vibrant, which looked gorgeous against the autumn backdrop. The fit was so flattering on my growing bump, and it made me feel both comfortable and elegant throughout the shoot.  For reference, I’m 5'4"" and 200 lbs, and I got a size L, which fit me perfectly (I was 26 weeks pregnant at the time of the shoot). The material is soft and flowy, so it draped beautifully without feeling tight or restrictive. It was exactly what I needed for both comfort and style.  If you're looking for a dress that’s stylish and versatile enough for special occasions like photoshoots and can also be used with or without a bump, this one is a winner. I couldn’t be happier with how it turned out in our pictures!",

But it fits great, not too tight, not too big. The sleeves slim down the arms. It’s not alot of extra material that may leave the sleeves looking weird/big like other dresses of this style. The dress is long almost down to my ankles so id suggest wearing heels with it if you’re short. It also was very pleasant when it sat on my chest and didnt make me look as bug as I am, which is hard to find. Also the design is simple and elegant. It isnt too busy looking and the color is beautiful for a spring/summer dress. Lastly, this dress is made of sheet material but has material built in underneath that is not transparent. Therefore this dress is not see through. All in all, it was a great purchase.",4

First of all, I ordered this dress and received the wrong item entirely. I returned it and ordered it again in 2 colors. The tan or coffee color is not cute. It was also torn at the top of the V, and it was sewn unevenly. The pink one didn’t have these issues, but as you can see, it’s not the most flattering dress. I had to bunch it up under my boobs to make it look right because if I pull it down the bust part is way too long. The hem on the sleeves also looks cheap. The quality of the fabric was not terrible, and it wasn’t super heavy or hot. The waistband was stretchy, but the back was really baggy. I wouldn’t be able to wear a bra at all without it showing in the back. Overall, this dress is horrible for the price.",4

I tried taking as many good pics as can so if you’re reading you know what’s up. I’m 5’5 and about 185-190 xl was recommended so that’s what I got in the “olive green”. First of all the olive that is advertised doesn’t match the actual color you get. I don’t think the shade they used looked good with my skin tone. I absolutely loved the length of the xl on me! Went all the way to ground. In the photos you can see my feet with the black dress but not with the green one. BUUUT the width around the under part of your boobs (not really your waist, was a little loose so I ordered a large in black (original color I wanted) and that part fit great! It would have been perfect EXCEPT for the fact it came ripped on the chest part-see photo. Next, the black dress v-neck area was sewn way higher up than the green one! Did not look flattering at all. Also, the back v part of it was more loose than the green one too even tho it was a smaller size! It came down exactly to my ankles->black large. The v part on the back of the green dress wasn’t as “loose” and looked better but for some reason the arm cut out holes felt weird; like they came closer to my armpits and I can’t handle it-the black dress didn’t do this. I needed this dress for a wedding and have unfortunately ran out of time to get another one hoping it’ll work. You take a 50/50 chance if you get a good one. The material kind of reminds me of swimsuit material. This is a great dress tho for a wedding in May! It wasn’t thick and also not super thin.",7

Riegel,"Very nice, but…",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1B0VDCZJZ60C4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWNCTRWK,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 23, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: 3-dark Green,Verified Purchase,"This is a lovely dress, the shade of green is a nice dark emerald (not a bright jewel tone emerald) which is exactly what I wanted. The cut is beautiful, feminine, it is a bit transparent, but only when back lit (so maybe add a slip if you care). My only complaint is that the top of the dress, from the empire waist up, is too large, and obviously since these are one cut and not custom tailored, it’s probably just my body type. But the top droops. I need to decide to either return it, or get it tailored to tighten up the top, there’s at least an inch and a half of slack in the bodice where the shoulders could be brought in front and back, and the dress will still be low cut. So, if you’re a bit smaller on top, just know it might not fit well and you might need to get it tailored. I think it’s probably worth it if you have the time (all my local tailors are booked weeks out) and the funds, unfortunately I wanted to wear this to a wedding coming up in a few weeks and it took over a week for it to ship, and I had no way to know how it would fit until it arrived. I didn’t see any other reviews mention this so I wanted to mention it for any future shoppers. It would still be lovely to have for other future events or dates once tailored.",3

The fabric itself was good, but it was not sewn the best and also was clearly not the exact dress from the picture. I say this because first of all the dress was sewn a little asymmetrically so that it would hang down more on one side than the other. And as far as the imitated design, the rauching on the front between the breasts was much longer than shown in the picture and looked bad. It lengthed the dress in the chest area which caused the fabric to fold and wrinkle around the boob in a very unflatering way. Because I bought the dress last minute I ended up wearing it anyways but actually wore it BACKWARDS because it somehow looked better that way, and more of the imperfections were on the front.",
