I am happy with the look, fit, and fabrication of this blouse. The short sleeves are trimmed in a white bric-a-brac and there are several matching buttons at the neckline. I like that the sleeves are flattering and not puffy or too short. They hide the flabby parts of my arm and the tulip cut has a slimming effect. The blouse bodice is fully lined, and it drapes nicely, even over my wide hips. I paired this with a simple pair of slacks and with the button neckline, you really do not need any additional accessories. I wore this to work and received so many compliments! It was a nice pop of color in my bland winter wardrobe! I layered this under a blazer but would be confident wearing it on its own come warmer weather. Made in China, this 100% polyester blouse is an easy wear, easy care look that will have you pulled together and out the door for work in the blink of an eye! This blouse is machine washable. To protect the fabric and sleeve trim, I washed this inside a mesh garment bag in cold water. I then hung it to dry. Once dry, it did not need any ironing. Out of the package, it had creases from being folded and vacuum packed. I tossed it in the dryer on the refresh cycle for 10 minutes, pulled it out while still warm and all the wrinkles fell away! This top can be dressed up or down, wear with jeans and sandals or slacks and ballet flats! I love that it isn’t low cut or puffy in the sleeves. Overall, it fits me perfectly and for size reference, I am 5’4” and weigh 150lbs. I am pear shaped with a 36b bust.",19

It is a great top. The sleeves are a great length and the overlapping and pom poms are darling details. The pattern isn’t grandmaish at all. It is very faltering and works for a lot of different skin tones. The buttons down the front lets you wear an undershirt to open up the neckline. The length of the shirt is good and can be tucked in. I wouldn’t wear it with leggings. The best part of this shirt is that it is lined with a coordinating color. This shirt is a great pattern and has a lot of details that make it stand out.,2
