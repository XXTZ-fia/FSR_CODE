Not much shape through the body, so a belt will help. The pink color I ordered was more orange than I expected from the picture, more like a coral, but still pretty.  Just not pink. And it does run big, so I have another dress picked out that will be a size smaller. This “pink” was a tad see-through, so I’ll have to wear a slip with it. I’m tall, so the longer length was a bonus for me.  Yes, it has pockets, but they are a bit oddly placed. More for carrying lightweight items than putting your hands in, or phone and keys.  As another reviewer said, there is one tiny tag with an “L” on it, but no content or washing instruction tag. It seems a soft, stretchy polyester blend, not stiff or thick, soft to the touch. So I’m thinking it will wash and dry on low just fine (though I’ll do so turned inside out to help prevent pilling).",
