But.. The underskirt part is pointless, it's way too short and gets bunched awkwardly. Skirt isn't see through or anything, idk why they thought to sew barely 6 inches of white cloth under the whole deal, it barely covers my ass. Just cut that off and ur good. It's a little small for being 1 size. Just get skinnier, I guess. I'm 5'5 150 lbs with a bigger hind end than midsection. Loads of compliments on this skirt. Has held up through many washings and getting shut in car door a lot and stepped on when I'm bending over to push kid around on bike. A highly favored article of clothing.",
