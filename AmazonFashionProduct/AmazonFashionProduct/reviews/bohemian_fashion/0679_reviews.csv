medire27,Beautiful fit and fabric,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCXPQNC2UAQXG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNTN4L67,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Yellow Green Floral,Verified Purchase,"After reading reviews and seeing the customer images, I purchased a large hoping for a smooth supported fit in the bust, and it did just that. I was shocked that it would fit snug without having to stretch out the elastic back AND be so comfortable at the same time. I have a rectangular figure-even when I was a size small-and this dress floats away from my waistline giving me an hourglass appearance. I love the color and pattern of the turquoise blue, and will keep my eye on any new patterns. I'm 5'1"" and some large prints overwhelm me and tiny flowers are not appealing on me at my current 14/16 size. The material does crease but I think it will come out fast with my travel steamer. This dress would be lovely for a beach wedding or a tropical cruise, with sandals or platforms. A sinple lightweight pashmina wrap will allow you to cover up in the evening or enter a European basilica (shoulders must be covered). I love it!!",

Examined it; got my cuticles scissors; carefully snipped every tiny stitch until the ruffle fell from the dress. Bingo! I had made it a dress I could wear.  No.  I couldn't. Couldn't wear a bra with it, and the girls were hanging down to my navel.  My bare under arms were flapping like kites in the wind.  The design, style and color were just beautiful.  Packed it up and sent it back to Amazon.  I hope it's found a home of some young girl with boobs that aren't flapping in the wind. Linda Kesselman",
