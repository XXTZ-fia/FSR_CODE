Las Vegas customer,Beautiful skirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FGAM61ST3BVC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBRL5SG,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Size: Large-X-LargeColor: Purple,Verified Purchase,"I'm 5'5"" tall, 140 lbs. I could have easily gone with a small/medium instead of the large, but I wanted to made sure it was long enough. The length is perfect and I can adjust the waist since you tie it. Next time I might try one in small to see the actual difference. It's a thick skirt, sewn well and the colors are vibrant. The patchwork is beautiful, prettier in person. It doesn't look cheap. It can be dressed up or dressed down. I love this skirt and will be buying a second one. This skirt is 100% cotton. If you are going to wash it yourself, hand-wash it in cold water and lie it flat to dry it or most likely will shrink. I'll poetically rage it to my cleaners to have it professionally cleaned.",

The fabric is thick and feels like very good quality material. The colors are gorgeous, fun, and super vibrant. This skirt style could be styled multiple ways depending on season and occasion, winning huge points for versatility.  I'm a size large (12), and the L-XL fits me beautifully. I plan on buying a few more, as the quality is well worth the money.  Highly recommend these skirts! Couldn't be more pleased with my purchase!  **Update: I purchased another skirt, and the seam isn't sewn in several areas (I plan on sewing any areas that need it). But...at $40 each, a person shouldn't have to mend it upon taking it out of the package.  I wore the first skirt I ordered (the one pictured), and decided it needed to be washed. As per the care instructions, I hand washed it in cold water with a very small amount of mild detergent. The amount of color that it lost was alarming.  I'm sad. I absolutely love these skirts, but I'm really not feeling like these were worth the money now.  My advice to potential customers? If you're as in love with the style as I am, and still decide to order, go into it knowing that the color won't stay as vibrant and that you will likely need to sew seams.  My advice to the seller? Do better quality control and use better dyes. I promise you'll have more return customers.  Lowering my 5 star review to 3.",14

I also have an ileostomy and prefer skirts and dresses. Iykyk. I have tried so many skirts over the years and they’ve all failed. Too tight or too loose in the waist, too short, too clingy, too see through, or uncomfortable, etc. This skirt is the unicorn I’ve been looking for. 100% cotton? Check. Comfortable? Check check. Looks good? Checkity check check. I love that I control the way the waist fits due to it being a wrap skirt, and that it can shrink or expand depending on where my weight wanders (it fluctuates by about 15 to 20 lbs). I bought one, fell in love and bought another. Plan on buying one more. All hail the ultimate boho wrap skirt. My inner hippie is rejoicing.",32

Wrap skirt is flattering and can be worn by many different sizes although the skirts are a bit long.  I am short and have to hike them up a bit.
