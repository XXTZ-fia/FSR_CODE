However; I don't like the neck part. It has a wrap design that goes to the empire waist line. It's completely open. It does have a tiny clear snap about half way up but it does little good. I'll have to wear a shirt under it. Sleeves are beautiful. It's way too long and the material is so thin! I'm afraid I can wear it to church! Feels like it may wrinkle but I'm sending it back and can't wash it.,

The structured shoulders and flowy design are very flattering. The material is a little thicker, but still breathable. I do not like the positioning of the upper seam across the chest or buttons. I had to remove the buttons and use a safety pin higher on the top because they were in an awkward spot. Overall the dress was a win for a Thanksgiving outfit that looked nice for hosting, but comfortably allowed extra room for pumpkin pie! ;)",

My mother came to visit and had no idea I had put on so much weight.  The color is just beautiful. I wore white tennis shoes, without the back.  You could dress it up by wearing dressier shoes.
