It breathes and will keep its color.  The legs are on the shorter side, much to my delight (5’0”).  I have two complaints.  First, the shoulder straps are flimsy, so they fold up on the sides; they could use a layer of sizing to stiffen them up to lay flat.  Second, the sewing of seams is subpar.  After one wear and washing, the leg seam had a hole around 2.5” long.  I had to repair it.  Other than that, I love them!",3

AND THAT'S A REALLY BIG BUT! XD haha... One arrived torn... and The other tore up after pretty much just two maybe 3 wears... Like I didn't even wash them... I didn't even encounter the shrinkage issue... The design is adorable and I got a lot of compliments every time I wore it (the really colorful patchwork one)... And I'm not terribly rough on clothing... This was just normal wear... I wasn't doing any acrobatics... On possibly my third wear the patchwork set tore right across the butt! Like the fabric just shredded... Luckily I was wearing bike shorts underneath too u_u; I attempted to stitch them but I don't have much hope that they'll hold up ...probably what I'll do is just take them apart and use them as a pattern and make my own out of actually good fabric...🤣🤣 Haha... I really wish the fabric was better because I really like them! It's just, they're basically unwearable because the fabric is pitiful! I can't be going out expecting a wardrobe malfunction at any time...😖 So as much as I would like to recommend this I cannot... Steer clear unless you only want them for maybe one event...🥴",

At the end of the ride I stood up to get out of the ride and felt a breeze across my backside. I reached back and felt a rip. My friend exclaimed, ""your whole butt us out!"" Sure enough, there was a rip from pocket to pocket all the way across my bottom! I pinched the top and bottom portions of the fabric together and waddled off the ride and toward the nearest shop where I could buy some shorts, which was all the way across the park! I had to hold my butt to not show my underpants all the way. Lesson learned, stretchy pants only on rollercoasters on hot days. I had to throw away the last pair. There was no saving them with the way they ripped but I will be buying a new pair but won't be wearing them on any rollercoasters in the future.",12
