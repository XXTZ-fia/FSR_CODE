Chanie Tee,Very Beautiful Dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30N6ZKQ100OUJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKHGMCBK,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 27, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: S Print Rose Multicolored,Verified Purchase,I purchased an XXL based on reviews and should have sized down for a more tapered waist look. For reference I am 5’3 and currently 200lbs. I am very curvy with an ample booty and 36H bra size. The con in getting the XXL is the waist was not tapered and I don’t have a large waist line or “Mommy Pouch”. A XL would have given me a better look. Even though it wasn’t as tapered as I would have liked it was still beautiful. The colors were very vibrant against my dark brown skin tone. The back is out but I wore a red bra so it blended with the dress. The front fit well without being too big. Someone suggested bra or clothing tape. I did not need it at all. If you have smaller cup size such as a DD or smaller and you need a XXL then the front may need to be held with a pin or broach. The length was perfect for me and if it was a bit shorter I would have been fine with it. I wore 3 1/2 inch red sandals. I am at my heaviest weight and plan to drop down in size in the next couple of months. I will repurchase in a size L and M to determine which fits better. I am going in a cruise and would like to wear this dress. I will gift this to someone else in the family.,

The waist had a beautiful detail ruffle which highlighted her figure and the sleeves are sheer so this dress offered coverage for the Fall weather and her modest nature but also had a light feel to fit in with the theme.

It’s incredibly versatile—perfect for everything from work to weddings. I can easily dress it up with heels or keep it casual with flats, making it suitable for any event. The flowy fabric is super comfortable, and I always feel fabulous in it. Just a heads up—if you don’t have boobs bigger than a C cup, this might not fit as well. If you’re looking for a dress that combines style and comfort, this is definitely the one!",

I wore this to my mom’s milestone birthday celebration and felt pretty all day :-) I just ordered the brown/black version of this dress in Large. I wanted to try a larger size to see if it made any difference in the hang of the dress or how the back fits. The large gave me more room in the waist, which I did not need and don’t necessarily like. It did not provide more space in the breast area or the back, which I did not need but would not have minded at all.

I got the sage green color in size S and I am 130 lb 5'5 for reference. I was debating if I wanted to wear this or not due to the lack of support in the chest area. The way the dress dips into a deep V makes it a little challenging to wear a regular bra. I also want to note that the S was too big on me and I probably needed to size down to an XS so that had an impact on the tightness of the top part. It was super cute on, I will say but the only issue was that I felt a little too exposed in the chest area for a bridal shower. Maybe if I had a smaller size, it would have fit a little better in that area but I didn't have enough time to order a new one unfortunately.
