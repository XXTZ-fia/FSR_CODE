On some people this dress will be excellent and look super cute.  On me it is just okay.What I like:  The flattering square neckline.  The lightness of the material.  The pockets.  How easy 100% polyester is to care for.  The double layer of the front bodice with the gather skirt attached.What I don’t like:  The arm openings are much too large on me – gapping open.  The back of the dress.  Instead of having a top back piece similar to the front with the gathered skirt attached, they have used one solid piece of fabric and attached the thin piece of elastic at the waistline.  It looks cheap and makes the dress fit poorly.  The dress is heavier in the front, so the back rides up and pulls forward over the shoulders.This dress will be very cute on some, but only okay on me.  It is a nice light weight perfect for the hot days of summer with a flattering neckline and pockets.  I don’t like the cut/construction of the back and the armholes gap on me.",
