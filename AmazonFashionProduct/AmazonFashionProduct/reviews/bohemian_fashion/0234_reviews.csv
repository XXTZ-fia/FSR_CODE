But I was shocked at the difference.  Pretty much same price.  These were at least 2+ inches shorter and at least an inch narrower in the waste.  I like these pants baggy and long.

MS,high quality versatile pants!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9M9IA9QGKV6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C175FRL2,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 25, 2023",,,"For 10+yrs now, I've enjoyed harem pants for their comfort and versatility--and because it they align with my personal style. I wear them as longe pants, pajama pants, tango dance pants, dog-walking pants, ect:)) BUT it's difficult to find 100% rayon--which I love for soft/lightweight texture, skin-breathability and wrinkle-free laundry. AND it's even more difficult to find vibrant, solid colors. (The loud boho/yoga prints that I see in 99.9% of harem pants are NOT my style--and even if they were my style, they simply aren't versatile enough for me--because they can't act as wardrobe neutrals.) So what I LOVE about these harem pants are 1) the 100% rayon fabric and 2) the vibrant, solid colors. All this to say: Bravo, well done! By mixing/matching them with tops in complimentary and contrasting colors, I've been creating all kinds of colorful and yet understatedly elegant outfits (similar to upgrading a basic outfit of khaki pants/collared shirt.) I've been able to walk the dog in humid/hot weather--and NOT overheat--but also avoid bug bites on my legs. I've been sleeping in them comfortably. I've been running errands around town and feeling casually chic. And soon I'll be rotating them into my tango dance outfits as well. So thank you SO much for your inspiration and for creating this product.",3

They're so thin and flowy but keep my legs warm on a cool day, which is a bonus! The design and print is beautiful, and I've gotten so many compliments when I wear these pants. Now it's gotten much colder than usual here so I haven't worn them in a while, but I wear them more often indoors than outdoors now. The waist part is so comfy and flatters my silhouette, and it's stretchy so I can wear it even when I'm bloated (i.e., on my period) or really full from food. Overall, this is one of the best wardrobe purchases I've ever made!",

John the Wizard,Runs really small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R270EVM8M2YDIM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C175FRL2,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 9, 2023",,,So the first thing is the sizing chart that they provide is way off. I went by their sizing and these pants were so tight that if I were to try and bend over or sit down they would rip. The material is a lower quality and extremely thin so in the right light you can actually see through the material. It's a shame that the sizes is so small because I like the pants. The actual leg part is very comfortable and I like the pocket on the side because it has elastic at the top so it keeps it tight. If you do get these pants I would honestly go up about three sizes.,
