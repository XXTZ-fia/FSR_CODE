The material is thin, but not see-through. Perfect for summertime!  With that being said there was some inconsistency between the colors. I ordered the burgundy red, foresty green and yellow. Yellow- exactly as pictured and expected Green- there’s a weird patch of material over the left breast area, it’s almost like the material is thinner there?? So when it’s flush against my skin it kinda looks like there’s a stain almost, but when I bring the shirt to my eyes to look at it, it looks fine and there is no stain. Kinda odd. Red- the bottom of the shirt is not even. Like when I’m wearing it, it kinda slopes to one side. If you’re looking at me straight on, one side of the hem is longer than the other because of that gradual slope in material. Does that make sense?  All in all they are good tops and look very cute with leggings or a pair of shorts! I wanted something loose and airy and these provide that!",
Heather Mitchell,"Love this! Size down, though",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VLSQTL9LU486/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF3YX4Z3,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 4, 2024",Color: Gradient BlueSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I bought this in two different colors. I read mixed reviews on sizing. So I ordered one in my regular size XL (the blue) and a L (black). I do love them both but the most flattering fit in my opinion is the size down, large. For reference, I am 5,8” and about 228. I am pear shaped, smaller waist and big booty. My stomach does stick out since I’ve gained weight recently. This tank really hides that. It’s super comfy. And maybe it’s the bra I’m wearing but it doesn’t look bad with the tank. Especially if you wore the same color bra as the tank. My bra staps lined up perfectly with one of the straps on the tank. As you can see in the pictures. So, just depends on what you want. If you are wanting a bathing suit cover up maybe go with your regular size, but if you want something that gives some shape, size down one, or maybe even 2. But I highly recommend!! It’s so soft and buttery feeling.",5
