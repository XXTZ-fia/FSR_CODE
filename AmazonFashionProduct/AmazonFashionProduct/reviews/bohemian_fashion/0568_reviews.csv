It's very difficult to find square neck, so that was a bonus and it minimizes my wide shoulder issues nicely as well. Hoping they'll come in more different hues and not so bold -- something more subtle... will be keeping an eye out for different colors. Also was relieved to see it comes in 2X, that's appreciated too.",
