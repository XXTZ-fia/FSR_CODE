The matetrial is cheaper and not as soft.  The leg of the pants is about 4 inches shorter (and now too short for me).  They had a gusset before which made them last a little longer, but they have also gotten rid of that.  I will not be purchasing these pants again.  I'll have to try to find another brand of better quality.",

Beautiful and comfortable. Perfect fit. I am small, and it is hard to find pants that go small enough, but fortunately these run shorter than most other boho pants I looked at. Lightweight with nice pockets.  However, they are not color fast at all. The purple color immediately turned my water purple when I washed them and leaked onto the bathtub where I left them to dry. The dye also ran a little into the patterns on the waist while drying, though the pattern is busy enough that no one will notice. I recommend hand-washing every pair by themselves and laying them flat out in a bath tub or something to dry. If they are touching other clothes while drying, they will probably stain the other clothes. They may also stain what you dry them on; you can wash the color off a tub but maybe not a wooden drying rack. Laying them flat instead of hanging may reduce the dye running and affecting the patterns, though this position will also take longer to dry. I would hesitate to put these in a washing machine, but if you do, they should be the only item in the cycle.  Unless your goal is to tie dye your other clothes, in which case, go for it.",13
