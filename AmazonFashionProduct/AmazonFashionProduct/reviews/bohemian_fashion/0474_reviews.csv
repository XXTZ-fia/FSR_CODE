Rosie,Stitching doesn’t hold up,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SXFSI1GD0O6D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CB4QV6D,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 21, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Andaman Blue,,I ordered 2 pairs of these in 2 different colors and absolutely love the fit and fabric.

If you buy these please inspect the crotch before wearing just in case they come apart like mine.,

They're made of a lovely light flowy rayon, and the gorgeous dye pattern is actually dyed into the fabric, it is NOT a print. I love the stretchy waistband, totally non-binding and comfortable, especially if you're like me and have a sensitive tummy that can't stand tight elastic waistbands. This one feels like it's holding you, but not putting pressure on you. The waistband makes it so you can wear them high-waisted, or sitting on your hips (assuming your legs are long enough.)  The best part for me is that these pants are LONG. I have long legs and trying to find cute pants that are actually long enough is a trial. These hit me at the ankle, lower if I wear the waistband lower.  The baggy side pockets are cute. The colors in my pants (I bought two pairs of these) are beautiful, but in fairness the colors are a bit more muted than what is pictured above. However, anyone who loves tie-dye knows that no two are alike, and that's part of the beauty of that fabric art.  I do love these pants and recommend them highly. I hope I've been helpful!",

I currently weight 170… 5’6 and have an hour glass figure. 42in hips, 33 waist- mediums fit me great, I got large at first and they would have also been fine but are too long and much more baggy. The medium are the perfect length and fit me better.  I liked the color on the large better they were a little more bright, the mediums decidedly do not have as much tie dye on them or rather it’s just not a lot of the bright blue which I really liked but the fit us better and the color is good enough. I may at some point buy one of the other colors because I really do like them.  Other reviews say they bleed really bad, I so update my review after I wash them off this is a problem.. however I recommend anyone reading to do the hippie tye dye method of white vinegar before washing (google it) to set the dye. After that wash in cold water on gentle or hand wash. Then hang dry. If I don’t add to this techies one that went well and I’m still happy.  Edit- I just bought these pants in small (the bright blue tie dye ones) as well and they fit perfect, still flow but they give me more of a shape and fit my butt/legs in a much more flattering way. So depending on what look you’re going for but the mediums are so much more baggy than the smalls (which are still baggy and comfy but I don’t swim in them).  I’m going to say I love both, the mediums I like to wear when I’m feeling bloated because they are baggy but still tight on my waist so I feel like it hides my stomach if I’m self conscious about it. I also like the baggy pants but tighter crop top (or tied up t shirt) look — I get so many compliments on both pair. Hope this helps!!",8

I work from home and literally wear these pants every day until I have to switch to warmer comfy pants for winter. Literally, as in the actual meaning of the word ‘literally’ lol.  These pants are SO comfy. The waistband is elastic and stretchy and doesn’t get uncomfortable or dig in. The pockets are nice sized and fit my dog’s ball, some treats, and some bags for outside play time with room to spare. I prefer these wide leg ones to the harem style, (just my own weird sensory issues stuff) but these can drag on the ground a bit for me, so the harem style is great for when it’s been a little rainy outside and I don’t want my pant legs getting wet or muddy. I bought my first pair of these in probably 2018 (maybe even 2017), and some of the elastic isn’t quite what it used to be, but they’ve held up really well considering how many times I’ve worn and washed them. And I still wear them all the time- they’re still in pretty great shape. (I wash them on cold, delicate cycle, and then I hang them to dry- I’m not someone who’s super careful about garment care and following washing directions lol, and they’ve held up really well for me.)  If you’re on the fence, buy the pants. They’re really super comfy. For reference, I’m around 5’6”and 175lbs-ish; I could probably get away with a large pretty easily, but I like an oversized xl.

Unfortunately the Miami teal wasn’t anything like the pic. I didn’t even get a snapshot. These are real tie dye so there’s some variation but the Miami teal colors were muddled together but 2 out of three isn’t bad. I’d hope to order the sunset orange but it was completely out of stock. I’m going to wait till I size down since I’m on a weight loss journey, but don’t hesitate to buy either variation seen here. Im down 10 lbs but still went with the xl but I do wash them on delicate and dry them on the extra low setting and they have held up good so far with no shrinkage.
