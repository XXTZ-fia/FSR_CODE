Fit well for One Size, but if you are bigger than a 12-14 might be too small.  I am a 10 to 12,  5' 3"" and around 140 lbs.  The pink color was great, looked better as a dress than a skirt on me.  The skirt was cute, but the tie in the front accentuated the stomach.... mine is not entirely flat, LOL.  As a skirt is was at my ankle.  Still it is adorable and being able to use it as a skirt or dress was a plus.... two outfits from one.  It does need ironing after packing, but was easy to get wrinkles out.  Great for a vacation in the sun.",

It's even lovelier in person!! I ALSO ordered the Mandala 12 (the emerald green). Both are so pretty in person. I'm size 12-14 on the bottom half in pants or skirts. I weigh 170lbs, & I'm 5'5"". These skirts fall just at my ankles, they're very nice looking & they fit great. They are lightweight & easy to move around in. & Not scratchy at all. I'm probably going to order another. Just to let you know: These are snug on me,-but not tight...I realized tho', that if I even weighed 15 lbs more, then I'm positive these would then be really tight & uncomfortable on me, FOR ME. I thought some might want to know that info while ordering. Thx seller, & Amazon. Have a nice day, everyone!",4
