Flattering V-Neckline: The V-neck is just the right depth—not too low, but still gives a flattering, feminine touch. It pairs perfectly with a simple necklace or layered jewelry.",

The sleeves are great in theory but if those things accidentally ride up, boy does it leave a dent in your skin because it’s cuffed so dang tightly! Fabric was lightweight and soft, just not very airy in the sense that if you sweat in this thing, you will not be able to unsmell it. Would love if offered in a different material like cotton. Overall, cute and modest, with a decent fit but would not want to purchase again. Only thing to probably help with the material is to wear something underneath but nothing can help those scrunched sleeves…",3

It's stylish but comfortable, and I could wear it all day. I got it in a large, and I'd say it's a great fit because I'm a bit chesty. My normal top size is between a medium and a large, and I'm really happy I went with the larger size, so that might be something to consider if you're on the fence. Also, the quality of this dress is solid. It's not see through or anything, and the design is nicely done. I like that it's a great transition piece from summer to fall, and it looks great with some tall suede boots. I'm very pleased with this dress.",

joe Phi,A Perfect Blend of Style and Comfort,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I5WDQPVD2JO1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5X6C8F6,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 4, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Orange,,"This dress is a true blend of style and comfort, making it an ideal addition to any wardrobe. The fabric is incredibly lightweight and breezy, perfect for warm summer days. The floral pattern exudes a delightful retro vibe, adding a touch of nostalgia to my outfit. The vibrant mix of orange, pink, and cream colors stands out beautifully, making it suitable for both summer and the early days of fall.  One of the aspects I appreciate the most is the flowy design, which ensures comfort without compromising on style. The material, 100% polyester, is light and airy, allowing the dress to move gracefully with every step. Despite being polyester, it doesn't feel heavy or clingy, which is a huge plus for me.  As someone with a tall frame (6 feet), I often struggle to find dresses that are long enough. However, this dress fits perfectly in both length and overall fit. I did size up, which worked out well for my height, but I now realize that a size smaller might have been a better choice. To adjust the fit, I plan to add some elastic to the sides or back, which should make it more tailored to my body shape.  The dress looks exactly as pictured in the product images. The embroidery and lace trim add a delicate touch, enhancing its overall appeal. It’s a versatile piece that can be dressed up or down, depending on the occasion. Pairing it with sandals gives a casual look, while adding some accessories and heels can elevate it for a more formal event.  In terms of comfort, this dress scores high marks. It’s perfect for those days when you want to look stylish without sacrificing comfort. The material is soft against the skin, and the flowy design ensures you stay cool and comfortable all day long.  One minor adjustment I’ll be making is taking it in a bit on the sides, but that’s a personal preference. This dress is a beautiful, comfortable, and stylish choice that I’m glad to have in my collection. If you’re considering adding it to your wardrobe, I highly recommend it, especially if you appreciate a good balance of retro style and modern comfort.",3

White embroidered stripes on either side of the front accents nicely & the long flowing sleeves are neither tight, nor heavy. A slight cut on either side of the bottom adds a complementary flash of leg, while not giving too much away. Yes, I do love this fabulously complementary dress. But sadly, I went with a large, its a bit too large, so wish I had ordered a medium. Just know this dress is quite flowing and forgiving. I would suggest a size down to allow the full attributes that this delightful garment can provide given the right size for your figure.

I appreciate sealed polybags due to the extra protection they provide, but I don't like the chemical smells that are often trapped inside. I hope to eliminate the scent by throwing it in the washing machine, but only time will tell. Aside from that one flaw, the dress is adorable and will look great in the fall with tall boots and a light cardigan.",
