I am a medium but often it is recommended I order XL because let’s face it, most of the clothing runs small.  I went with a L because I thought a 48 wide bust would be plenty roomy.  Although the kimono fits, it’s not roomy in the bust area for me so I measured it.  It is 40 inches.  I will probably keep it - too afraid to order up with end up with something huge - but an 8 inch difference from the size chart - I checked the label and it says L.  Such a difference in size makes me know I will hesitate to order anything else because the discrepancies in size just isn’t acceptable and I am weary of how many returns I have made as a result of past purchases.  Please Amazon, if you want less returns, make sure what you sell is true to the size you are advertising. I give this 3 stars because it’s nice enough but I really wanted to give it a 2 based in the misinformation about size.",

I live in a hot and dry environment, but I’m in the mountains and near a creek so spring and summer means lots of little bugs bothering you when you’re outside. I was looking for some type of robe or kimono/coverup that would mostly cover my arms and legs, while not stifling the air flow so I could still benefit from the breezes and movement. This material is a poly-chiffon fabric and they’re perfect for that purpose. A few hours before sunset, I put this on when I’m outside and it really does work to keep the buggers off of me. I was initially annoyed that there was no waist loops to pull fabric through so that I could pull it closed. But I soon discovered that the slits are not just there for looks but for function as you can easily pull the first two sections towards the middle to make your own waist strap to tie it without losing the coverage. If this sounds confusing; I’ll include a quick photo and video as an example. Long story short, I can make use out of this for three seasons to wear around when there’s a chill in the air but not enough to wear some extra coverage. Additionally, it’s perfect when I want something to throw on top of a more revealing nightgown when I need a glass of water or something, or to throw on after I get out of the pool. Don’t expect it to absorb water, but it definitely covers you after you’ve dried or drip-dried and provides coverage if you’re more modest and/or self-conscious of your body.  It’s light enough weight that it doesn’t weigh you down. The quality is what one woild expect at this price range on Amazon. Though I don’t own any of the longer ones like these until now, I own several of the poly-chiffon cardigans/jackets/coverups that come down to about my thigh and they’re all still holding up after several years. I will keep an eye out and buy a couple more when they’re on sale because I’ve found that it’s the first thing I reach for now!",

The fabric is kind of a slippery smooth translucent crepe.  I’m 5’5” and it’s about mid calf on me.  I was expecting more of a cotton, but this is okay.  It wasn’t expensive at all.The cons- it’s basically a tablecloth, it doesn’t have sleeves, it’s a folded up square of fabric with slits for the arms and a cut straight down the front.  It might be flattering if you’re a skinny young thing, but on me, a chonky middle aged lady, it looks a bit like I’ve grabbed the nearest bed sheet or graduation gown.  The serged edge of the neckline and front opening is kind of rough against the back of my neck, and the front edges are slippery and fold back on themselves and slide off the sides of your chest.For what I paid (there was a deal on it for $11.99) I’m not going to return it, and it might look nicer with the skirt and top I wanted to wear it with, or maybe a pair of denim shorts and a tank top.  It is a super flowy and lightweight over piece and the design and colors are very pretty.",
GM WASHINGTON,🚨NOT AS ADVERTISED ‼️,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IQ1N8BYWQJLG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09GLNCDPQ,"1.0 "," the United States "," April 12, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: D17,Verified Purchase,"I received ""Hibluco"" store brand, ""Women's Summer Chiffon (Orange) Floral Kimono Cardigan Long Swimwear Cover-Ups"" within two days of order. The item was received neatly quarter squared fold in a merchants' ziplock bag within an Amazon paper mailer.  Unfortunately, the ""Hibluco"" brand chiffon-polyester kimono is a very poor facsimile of the depicted original. The photo image appeared to be more vibtant in color and fabric densely weighted with perhaps of a polyester cotton blend fabric. Regrettably, I received is a thin transparent, super lightweight poly-rayon material that mimics chiffon. The ""garment"" is squared-cut and draped shamelessly making for an unflattering nondescript coverup. Regardless the repositioning or manner of wardrobe paired, the fit is blah!. In fact, depending upon the fashion attire, this coverup defeats its purpose as a camouflage for a fuller figured woman's (midsection and posterior). I stand at 5'9"" and weigh between 170-180 lbs.; measurements 38D-33-34...the length cut off around 1-2 inches below my thigh. I wanted a cover up below my knees or at minimum calves length or longer. Very disappointed as a returning customer. Not sure that I can trust the inconsistencies in quality and image misrepresentations. Buy at your own risk! I cannot attest to washability, stability, or durability because I plan to return.
