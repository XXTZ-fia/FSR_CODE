L,Wish I Never Ordered It- Revised Review,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S0A62LHAW77C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C43SCCFC,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 28, 2023",Color: #04 Mint GreenSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"This is day 22 of waiting for this package to arrive. While that is irritating enough, the reviews are getting more and more negative regarding the fabric having no stretch and feeling cheap, and workmanship being poor and the sewing coming apart. I also didn’t know I’d have to pay shipping going in. I should have ordered the one with a little higher price, free shipping and better reviews.  Revision- I had no way of knowing my package was delivered to a mail carrier yesterday (day 23), and subsequently delivered to my mailbox. Tracking wasn’t updated so there was no way of knowing, neither was there communication with the seller.  That being said, my jumpsuit has arrived. I don’t know what happened with the reviewers who said that the fabric has no stretch, that its low quality and the sewing is poorly done. My jumpsuit has a lot of stretch, and the stitching looks to be excellent. The fabric is soft and drapey, not stiff at all. Perhaps the ones made from the black fabric had the problems? It seems that way from the reviews. At any rate, the only problems I had with this purchase in the end is that it took so long to get here, and I had to pay shipping. Other than that, I am quite pleased with my purchase.",4
