I'm 5'10"" 230 lbs and they fit. I was afraid they would be too tight around my pudgy waist but the shirring is just right. I usually can't stand elastic around my waist but these are comfortable. They are just a little bit too short, showing quite a bit of ankle, but for this type of pants that's OK and it looks good.  They do not have in-seam pockets, just a patch pocket on the side. You can wear them backward or forward to put the pocket on whichever side you prefer, but having no other pockets for my keys and wallet mean they are not good for me to wear anywhere requiring keys or wallet.  The print is beautiful. I looked over them and they look like they are put together well. They are supposed to be made of bamboo rayon, a fabric I know nothing about. They are not sheer at all. The weight of the fabric is like a thin silk. They feel dressy. I would be hesitant to wear them casually like to work or school (where jeans would be appropriate), but they would be great for around the house where they won't get a lot of action or alternately to something where you stand around looking pretty.  They definitely feel like something you would want to hand wash. However, they are lightweight so they will dry quickly just on a hangar.  I bought several different kinds but this one came in today. Will update if there is any issue.  My mirror has a scratch across it. Sorry if it makes the photos look weird. Normally I eschew having my picture on the internet but I found it very helpful to see the fit from another buyer. I have a weight loss goal and these pants will fit as I work toward it, so that's a big plus. (pun intended)",16
