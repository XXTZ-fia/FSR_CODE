I originally order Large (my usual size) but here of late Agan's sizings seem a little off. I returned it for an XL, but they were out of stock.  So  I got a 2X, especially since reviewers say they shrink a bit (which is par for the course with Rayon). Ladies Please do yourselves a favor HAND wash in COLD WATER with Woolite and hang dry.

Purchased this one, the same blouse, same size, etc in green and immediately noticed when I put it on it doesn't seem to have the same coverage as my burgundy one.  When held up together, the green one is 2-3 inches shorter in length through the torso than the burgundy one, and doesn't have nearly the waist/butt coverage.  I doubt I'll ever wear this one due to the fit.  I'm not sure if my burgundy one is longer than it was supposed to be, or the green one is shorter, and it makes me hesitant to order more without being able to actually try them on first (I had planned to order the other ones I've already gotten in different colors).  Otherwise, this is another very pretty blouse, with the same construction quality I've come to expect from Agan.
