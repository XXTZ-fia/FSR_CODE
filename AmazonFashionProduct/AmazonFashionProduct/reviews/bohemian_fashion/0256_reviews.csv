Nana,VERY PRETTY TOP,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WQW2GXMICVB5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Size: 4X-Large PlusColor: Apricot With Black Floral,,"This is a lovely top with a pretty 60’s vibe paisley print. The black and tan color gives a classy look, and the feel is silky soft. Word of advice, order 1 size up. I ordered a 4x instead of my regular 3x, to save the hassle of returning it. It seems most clothes ordered here in my regular size run small and I’ve lost 30lbs so there shouldn’t be a problem but that isn’t the case. Overall, you won’t be disappointed; this top is well made and finished nicely with no thread hanging, etc.",
Feathersong,Good quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DNCUEEV980JU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Size: 3X-Large PlusColor: Boho Print,,"I got the ""Boho"" print & I love it. I get so tired of florals, so the design on this is a nice change. I really like the colors in it too. Love the sleeves on this top. I'm quite short (4'11""), so I prefer tops with 3/4 length sleeves, as they are almost like long sleeves on me.",
Angeleyes,Nice Top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FK7BGUG4Z120/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Size: 5X-Large PlusColor: Boho Print,,Very nice and comfortable top. Fits true to size and made of nice cool material for the summer time.,
Balencia M E,3/4 Length Puff Sleeve,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PXMWIY722NDI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Size: 5X-Large PlusColor: White With Blue Floral,,"My favorite kind of sleeves are the 3/4 length. I do not have to worry about my sleeve getting wet when washing dishes. The fabric combination of 60% Polyester, 35% Rayon, 5% Spandex is perfect for softness and wrinkle free fresh out of the dryer. It is very soft and comfortable. I really like the blue filigree and flora design on white.",
Dinah Reviews,Great for plain Jane's,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SWQ4V7A3Y80H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Size: XX-Large PlusColor: Black,,"After having three c-sections, I am always looking for comfortable shirts that are loose around the stomach area.  This shirt is great because 1. I love 3/4 sleeve blouses and 2. it is nice and loose around the belly area.  The shirt is perfect for jeans, leggings or jean skirt.  You can dress it up or you can wear it casually, depends on your style.  The shirt is nice and thin. It does arrive in a vacuum sealed bag and has a smell when you open it, so be sure to wash it.",
Gavin Mesmer,Perfect Fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JUSZFN0L4TGB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Size: 3X-Large PlusColor: Apricot With Black Floral,,"This top arrives true to size and fits comfortably. It wears well and washes well, wrinkle free. It looks stylish enough for church and is comfortable enough for a back yard barbecue.",
Robin Belcher,Beautiful shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AHMD0PON6VE1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Size: XX-Large PlusColor: Boho Print,,It's s beautiful comfortable shirt. I love it,
ShelleLP,Cute top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1960V9N2SV6DM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2025",Size: 5X-Large PlusColor: Dark Purple,,"The color is vibrant. The material has a cotton feel and is comfortable in layers or by itself. The style is flattering, hiding all manner of sins. It is long enough to be blousy over the hips and core. I get compliments when wearing this top.  5 Stars Exceeds Expectations",
Debbie,Nice Blouse Overall,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QZR0QWKFVTN3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 31, 2024",Size: 3X-Large PlusColor: Apricot With Black Floral,,"I really like the color and cut of this blouse. The material is very soft and comfortable. It is a bit shorter than expected for the size. I did account for the origin of this item in sizing and guessed correctly to go a size larger than I usually order. The blouse that is modeled seems to fit differently than the one I received, my blouse is quite a bit shorter than I would normally like.",
Invisible Woman,Smooth fabric is good,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZIY4I9RS5345/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 31, 2024",Size: 3X-Large PlusColor: Boho Print,,"Smooth fabric which I like, hopefully will not pill (which most of the women's knit stretchy tops I've gotten lately pilled very quickly; I'm hoping because this is smoother and not poly/cotton, it will do better).  It fits as expected.  The boho print has more bright orange (less more muted natural colors) than I expected but is still good.",
ReviewingQueen,Average shirt; looks as pictured; runs small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1L50H9HTMNVN9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Size: 5X-Large PlusColor: Apricot With Black Floral,,"Overall, I would say that this is an average shirt, which is why I am giving it an average 4-star rating. The style, pattern, and coloring look as pictured.  Only taking off one star for a couple reasons. The main thing I am not a huge fan of is the material. It is a tad bit crunchy/stiff, but I'm hoping with more washing it will get better over time.  Also taking off one star because it runs quite small. I typically wear a 2X-3X in similar tops from department stores, but ordered the 5X in this as my experience is that online clothing like this tends to run smaller. That was definitely the right choice, as it fits much more like a 2X or MAYBE a 3X.  So I would definitely size up.  The length is good on me though which I like considering I'm pretty tall (5'11"").  For the affordable price ($19.99 at time of review), I would still recommend this shirt.",
RandomViner,Pretty Top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32DDZ9KZAL0TY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Size: 3X-Large PlusColor: Black With Red Floral,,"This is a really pretty top that feels like good quality.  The material is a poly/spandex blend, making it very loose and flowy.  The elastic just below the elbows is not too tight, which is important to me because I don't like that tight feeling on my arms.  The length of the top is good and hides my belly a bit.  I received the top in the black with red floral pattern and it's really pretty.  Sizing is very accurate and the fit was as I expected.  It kind of reminds me of old-time calico in a way - very cute and looks nice with jeans.  Very happy with it.",
Heather,"Doesn't hug the middle, very flattering",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P60VLFXVN039/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Size: 3X-Large PlusColor: Black,,"I love this shirt, I'm not sure if u can see it well as i got a black shirt but there is a kind of pleat thing under the v neck neckline, what that does is keep is from laying flat against the tummy! Love that! I also super like the thick thick bottom of the 3/4 sleeve, that means it is easy to touch up if u want without leaving those marks that really thin elastic can do. I'd buy this shirt again and I'm many different colors. I'm a size 3x or 22w just for reference",
DoverNH,Good for tall and plus sizes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Y95IBU63ZOCM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Size: 5X-Large PlusColor: Dark Green,,This is a nice shirt to wear to work or go out in. It is a soft comfortable material and the size is true to fit so it drapes nicely. The sleeves are a good length and the band is generous. The pleat at the neckline looks good and helps how it drapes. The neckline is fine but watch out if you bend over. Length is below hips. Over a good shirt.,
Laura of Harvest Lane Cottage,Comfortable...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PVZ4KN2MQCTE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Size: 4X-Large PlusColor: Black With Red Floral,,"I usually wear a size 30. I include these photos in case you are of a similar size and shape.  The fabric is smooth. The colors a bit muted, though I think the second photo does a pretty good job of capturing the shades. The print is a bit old-fashioned, but my 27 year old daughter said that she'd wear it to work.  It is comfortable. The sleeves are a great length to cover my arms for both modesty and warmth. They're short enough not to get in my way while washing dishes.  I'm not sure if the fabric will be comfortable when it gets hot. I don't know if it's breathable; but, for now, during the winter, it's quite nice.",2
Heidi Anne Heiner,Blue and White,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNHJIMUTQUAPM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNHGGJGJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 28, 2024",Size: 3X-Large PlusColor: White With Blue Floral,,"I like the blue and white pattern on this--the shirt is thick enough to not be see through. The shirt is true to size for the measurements provided. It is average quality. I machine washed it and then hung to dry with good results, no significant fading or shrinking. It is soft and comfortable with a flattering silhouette. The fabric may eventually pill but I will enjoy it while it continues to look good.",
