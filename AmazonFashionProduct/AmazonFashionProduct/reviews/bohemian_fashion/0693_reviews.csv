HappyShopper,Paintings Plus,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27ZMBAX8LH6XJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXJ1G12,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 14, 2024",Color: Painting02Size: Small,Verified Purchase,"I do not write reviews often, but sometimes I will if my opinion differs from the average consensus. I purchased a small for 36C gals and still have some wiggle room. I think that many times women do not realize their real bust measurement before ordering an item. This is why a great many returns incur. This top has the colors as vibrant as pictured and the sizing is correct by the table  to the consumer. The top is a bit longer than I like for I am only 5'5""@105, but otherwise the fabric is that of silky nylon and great for the price. One other issue I find the consumer can not get straight is the idea of sizing up or down. Folks, sizing up means larger and sizing down means smaller than your usual size!!!!!!",4
