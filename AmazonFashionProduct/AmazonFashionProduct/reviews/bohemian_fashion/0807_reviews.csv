FoxyDMc,I LOVE the green one!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ACTEYOCES43D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CL4JDHCD,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Solid Green,Verified Purchase,"The fabric is very soft on the mushroom one. But I don't find that one to be as flattering lol The green one seems to fit my frame better. I'm a 34b, I'm 5'6"" and between 115 and 120. I ordered a small. I've moved out of my bra phase lol straps are of better quality on the green one. In my experience the cord like straps can be iffy if not sewn properly plus wear and size of bust. So we shall see on that! But all in all these are great and cozy!!! I would definitely order again...",
