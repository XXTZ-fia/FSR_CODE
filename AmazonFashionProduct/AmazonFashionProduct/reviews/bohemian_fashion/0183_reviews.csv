At 5 feet 8 inches and 175 pounds, it fits me perfectly and is incredibly comfortable. The fabric is soft and breathable, ideal for various occasions.  This blouse is versatile -I love wearing it tucked in for a polished look or untucked for a relaxed vibe (both pictured on the attached photos). The neckline strings add a charming touch, whether tied or left undone.  It pairs well with sporty bottoms and shoes for a casual look or with jeans and dressier shoes for a more put-together outfit. The vibrant sky blue color and floral pattern make me feel confident and stylish. Overall, this boho floral blouse is a fantastic addition to any wardrobe, perfect for various occasions and easily adaptable to different fashion preferences. Highly recommended!",7
