Sadly, this brand doesn't make a 3X, which would be my ""next size up"".  ;)  Machine wash cool and hang dry to avoid as much shrinkage as possible.I love the green one so much I just purchased the pink one as well - and if it fits, I'll get the blue as well!",
Ah,Love! But they need to preshrink fabric!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I7FTBUAT6YUA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09PGBRK53,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 28, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: A-green,Verified Purchase,I love this shirt. Its flowy but flattering and I love the color and pattern. It looks like the pictures. But! I have not washed this shirt yet. Im afraid to. I bought the same shirt from another seller and after hand washing in cold and hang drying it shrunk and i cant wear it. This after ordering a shirt that was too big. I cant order larger than 2xl. I cant believe it shrinks that much in cold water! They should preshrink the material before making it.,

At first it looked like it was too big but after washing it in the washer & putting in dryer very briefly then hanging to dry , it fit me perfect & had no wrinkles . The fabric is a light weight flowing cotton blend , very comfy and not see through. The Hippie/ boho style is very cute & the design covers any extra bulges. I normally wear a XL , Amazon recommended medium. After reading reviews I decided to try the large & due to slight shrinkage , it fit perfectly. It seems to be well made to last for several years.  I am happy with this purchase.",

I ordered up a size to XXL and while larger it didn’t fit.  This version is not like the other.  It’s too small and I will have to send it back.  Too bad the sizing isn’t consistent.

Mama de la Playa,I LOVE this top (in the Blue and Green.),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R68F2Q6MDITT7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09PGBRK53,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 22, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: A-blue,Verified Purchase,"The fabric is perfect - very lightweight and not see-through. The pattern is perfect. The blue and white colors? Feels feminine. Perfect. I’ve already ordered the top in the other two available colors, even though I haven’t washed this one yet. Hoping that it’s perfect after laundering, too.  UPDATE: I’ve now washed it once (on Delicate, cold water) and dried (on Low, removing after only about 15 minutes to hang completely dry.) And guess how it came out? Perfect[ly]!! Almost no wrinkles. No shrinkage or fading colors. HIGHLY recommended.  UPDATE #2: Have now received the green and pink. I’ve not washed either. The green is wonderful. I love it. Same great, comfortable fabric, pattern and fit, as shown. To my sorrow, while the color and pattern of the pink was just what I wanted, the fabric and fit were not. It ran small, but most tragically, it was 100% polyester, and not just that, but the kind of shiny, sleazy polyester that doesn’t breathe and NO ONE wants to wear. But I give the Seller/Amazon a lot of credit because without any dispute whatsoever, I received notice that I’d receive a full refund, and I didn’t have to return it. I’ll donate the unworn blouse, and I’m encouraged to try again when I think I’ve found something I really like.",5
