It’s a great price and seems rather durable. Plus it looks comfortable and convenient, like a good option if you don’t want to use a backpack. The ONLY thing that we can critique is something that is our own fault for not checking the specs, and that is that the bag is huge in comparison to the actual product photos. My kid ordered it himself and doesn’t understand the posted specifications on anything online, so he just bases sizes off of the post photos. He was hoping it was a tad smaller, but he still LOVES the design and color. I love that this purchase not only made my kid happy but it also taught him a valuable lesson about reading the details when shopping online. He’s finally learning to not take things at face value because you never know how big the model is or how big/small the product will be to him in comparison. So it’s a win win on this purchase. 10/10 recommend",2
