It’s 65% polyester, 35% rayon, 5% spandex. And it fits clingy. Ugh  The black and white shirt does not cling. It hangs so nicely, and even feels dressy, if that makes any sense.  Here’s my thing: why say it’s this, when it’s not. Ugh!!!  Now I can’t order more because I have no idea what I’m getting.  Just tell the truth so that we buy what we want to buy.

Then I tried it on, thinking it would fit weird and I would be able to return for more than just one reason. But ... I liked the fit. Loose, but not sloppy. Sleeves were comfy. Length was nice and covered my tummy. And it was lightweight without being clingy and sheer. So, I decided to keep it and make it a casual work blouse, because it was a bit shiny. One wash, and the shiny faded a bit. And it felt more comfy. So, I washed it again. Perfect. It is now my favorite shirt, perfect for summer. Over the weekend, I wore it with cutoffs and flip flops, then put on jeans and white slip on tennis shoes when evening came. But, it also is cute with skinny pants and heels for work.
