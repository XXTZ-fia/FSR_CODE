Glenna and Bob,Leaves are quite short,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Q50ZPWDB4QSV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BSD7YNR,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I'm average height 5'6"" and this sweater seems like it is made for someone a few inches shorter. Fabric also feels very synthetic. I will probably hand wash and hang dry to prevent shrinkage. Cute but not a very warm fabric either. Good luck finding the button holes too; it is a bit confusing.",

Nightfall,"It’s soft and warm, but not good for cat people",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26RPIQDZ298F4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BSD7YNR,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 15, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Beige-mixed,Verified Purchase,"The pros:  The sweater is warm, soft, and attractive.  The color matches the description, and it is true to size. I wanted to be able to wear a cotton or thermal tee underneath, so I sized up to a medium and am happy with the fit.  You need to have a layer underneath, as there’s only one button, just fyi.  It is lightweight and very soft with no itchiness.  It’s decent quality for the price.The cons:  The open weave knit catches extremely easily on anything.  My cat sat on my lap for a bit, and his claws caught in the fabric multiple times.  At one point, he caused a huge run in the stitches.  Fortunately most of the little snags could be pulled through to the underside and aren’t visible, but the run in stitches is pretty obvious.  The fringe, which is thankfully not overly dramatic, hides some of it.I do love the look and feel of the sweater, but I can’t recommend it to anyone with a cat or any pet with claws.",3

I gave up and wear it hanging open. For those having trouble finding the button holes they are located at both front lower edges. I ended up removing the buttons. The back is much shorter than expected, which is a rather dated style. It would have been much better to have the back longer than the front. There is simply too much sweater in the front to drape nicely. Its not a sweater that you can layer underneath except for a tank top or thin, sleeveless top. Quality is an issue. I've worn it a few times and already it's raveling at back shoulder seams. This sweater could be great with tweaks to its design. I'll keep it for a house wrap but I cannot recommend it otherwise.",2

The one good thing I can say about it is that it’s soft and feels like it should be the perfect weight for fall.  With the said, that was the only positive thing I can say… Unfortunately, the color was way off from what is shown in the photos. Instead of being pretty, dark shades of burnt orange, browns, black and dark grey, it’s actually a bright pumpkin orange, a blue color and army green. The pattern isnt even remotely the same. I had to double check that I was even sent the correct sweater because it look anything like the one shown.  The cut isn’t even close either. I ordered it in large, which is the size the Amazon recommended for me. I expected it to be more narrow through the body, tight fitting sleeves and longer length, what i received is very wide through the body, with really baggy, almost puffy sleeves that are way too short and the length is super short. I’m 5’6, long legs and shorter torso, so when something is supposed to be longer, it almost always fits me as it’s shown to. The total length from the shoulder to the very bottom of the sweater is almost 21”, not the 31” that was stated in the size description. The whole sweater is very short and boxy and not at all flattering. Needless to say, it’s going back asap because unless I was shaped like Humpty Dumpty, this is not going to work at all.
