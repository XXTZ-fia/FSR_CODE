Selena,Needs Improvement Before Selling as Finished Design,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3246XN75IVNOK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08Z7YVJTX,"2.0 "," the United States "," May 7, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"I like where it comes up to on my waist, but the area for the butt in these is about as big as the area for the rest of the leg so if you have a curve to your rear it will hug it and not in a boho way. The breast pads feel like they are made almost out of packing peanuts, and the general quality of the fabric makes the cloth under the top ride up. Not to mention since the cloth is the same material as a cheap napkin it doesn't hold any definition around your breast. It is also slightly see-through. This is a good concept, and if they fixed these issues, included the shipping in the cost, and offered free returns, I would be willing to pay more for this outfit. Also, a small recommendation if they redesign this: the pattern on the top (circles, lines, squares, etc.) is so much bigger than the same pattern on the pants, it might actually work better to make them match and incorporate the butterflies on the top more.",28

Amazon Customer,Cheap and awful,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20R9OK742Q9I3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08Z7YVJTX,"1.0 "," the United States "," April 23, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"Cheaply made, the print does not match the photos and the top can’t hold any amount of chest because the bottom is too loose and the straps are too skinny. Would not recommend buying this outfit.",12

Complement my hour glass shape. So ladies if you are curvy, this is for you.. The pants are so cute. As far as the top, yes it looks cute but I am a 34DD and there is no under support. Luckily I had a bra that fits perfectly under it. For under $20 can't really complain about it aside from that.",5

I’m a curvy woman so I purchased bigger then my usual size just in case and it still came in fitting 2 sizes too small. The breast size fit for someone who is not heavy chested at all. Very disappointed. Fabric was also different as stated in the description.,
