I think the L would have been too small if it shrinks after being washed. I am short and chubby so I always go with XL. I would recommend ordering the size you normally wear, not necessarily the recommended size if you want more flowy and less form fitting. I prefer more flowy as form fitting for me is just not as comfortable. This is not a stretchy material either. Its adorable and I look forward to wearing it to work and out and about!",
