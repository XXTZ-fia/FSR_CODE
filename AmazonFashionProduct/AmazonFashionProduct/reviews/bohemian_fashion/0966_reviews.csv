I wanted to love these pants as I bought similar ones before from a different seller and they are amazing. The sticking in these is horrible, the waist band is sewn on flipped so if the back lays flat the sides and front are rolled in. You can tell this was done in a cheap factory similar to Shein where no one cares about quality and attention to detail only pushing out mass amounts of cheap products. So disappointed I was super excited for these pants especially after seeing photos and reading reviews. On top of not sitting properly on the waist due to crooked sticking of the waistband, they also don't flow very nice and are not flattering  if you have hips and the material is alot thicker and heavier then I was hoping.
