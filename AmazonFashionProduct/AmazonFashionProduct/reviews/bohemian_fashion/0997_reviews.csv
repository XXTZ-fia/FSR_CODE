It's pretty true to size, but seems a little snug across the bodice The fabric is super soft and easy to iron. One of the reviews mentioned that there were two sets of strings and tassels and it was too much. I totally agree! I removed the bottom set of ties and tassels and hand stitched up the front a little bit so I feel more comfortable wearing it. Reading the washing instructions tag was very challenging because it is so tiny. I took a photo of the tag with washing instructions then had Google translate from Chinese to English. It is: hand wash warm water and flat dry. Use a medium heat iron. I wish it had pockets. I absolutely love the border print on the sleeves and the hem of the dress. The piping across the bodice gives it a nice detail. It is not see through even outdoors. I think it's a great dress for the price.",7

I am perplexed as to how it garnered so many posirive reviews; reviews that influenced ne to make this purchase. Perhaps i recieved a defective garment. The sizing was completly off and not in accordance with size chart. The top part was way too small to fit a 40d bust. The opening at front is too low and does not close. The dress just hangs like a potato sack without any drape. Certainly not worth the price. It was too much hassle to return so it was just a loss fir me.,3

I had ordered an XL but am sending back.  The XL fit everywhere except where the skirt is attached to the top, it hit me right in the middle of my breast.  Apparently you need to be pretty flat chested for this dress.  I had plenty room in the top but the fit was just weird.  I reordered this in XXL which is huge and a little longer in the top.  I loved the dress and realize it is made to fit loose.  It's REALLY Loose.  I will use this dress a  pattern to make a couple more.  Too bad it's made in China as the chinese people are much smaller people and they apprenently don't understand US sizing.  I love the flow of the dress (Viscose).  I should learn my lesson because I end up buying dresses according to the size chart and they don't fit or bigger dress size that is huge than I actually wear when I order from China.  Buyer beware if you are bustie, this dress more than likely will not fit you.  Smaller bust will be okay.  Wish it was a good fit.",7
