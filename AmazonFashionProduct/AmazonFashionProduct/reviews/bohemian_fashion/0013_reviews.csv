Love the pockets too, and the neckline is flattering. I did have some issues though.  Dress #1 - was the blue & white print (43-print-5). A medium was too tight and showed panty lines (for 148 lbs), but the large fits perfect. Return and replacement was quick. Fabric is a good weight, not see thru, and can be worn as a dress not just a cover-up. Loved it so I ordered Dress #2 - black & beige print (print 24). The dress came with a small discoloration right in the middle of the black front. If it had been in the back I would've kept it, but returned it. The replacement came super quick and the material was perfect and even had a little better feel than the 1st one. However it stunk like cat pee. It was awful. I hung it up overnight and it smelled up my big closet too. I debated on returning this one too, but since otherwise it was good, decided to wash it and use the scent booster beads also. By the way, it does wash nicely but I hung it to dry to be safe. I think that worked, it seems to just smell like those beads now, but time will tell if the smell comes back. So basically I'm happy with the 2 dresses but hoping that the smelly one will stay good, otherwise I won't be so happy with that one.  UPDATE: Dress still smells good so now very happy with the black dress, and my 1st blue and white one!",3
