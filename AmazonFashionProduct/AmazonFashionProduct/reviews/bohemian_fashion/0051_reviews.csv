Shadagee,Cute- but tough to believe that these are plus sizes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZ544K43FU1QK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D53DL7HX,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 17, 2024",Color: BeigeSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I’m a hippie who dresses as one for a 60’s band. Shirts like these in cotton or gauze are hard to find. This was a direct purchase from China. It took a LONG time to get here.  I think some people are expecting thicker fabric, better construction and fit. Well, I harbored no illusions, and it was just right for me. It’s a very see through fabric and will probably need a cami underneath. It wrinkles easily. The lace will probably itch.  However. It looks great and will be very breezy during hot shows.  Fit: this is advertised as a plus size, but I have my doubts. My normal size is XL and it’s a little on the snugside. I’m 5’5” and 165 lbs. I got another color in XXL which I’m sure will fit.  In the end, you cannot beat the price. It was worth the wait.",

It has pretty lace, quite roomy, and almost covers your butt. There's no feeling that it's too short like some tops can feel. It is a bit sheer but very nice for hot weather.  Washing instructions: Soak it in cold water with 3 teaspoons of salt overnight before washing. Wash on a delicate cold cycle and let it air dry. It needs a bit of extra care, but well worth it!",3
