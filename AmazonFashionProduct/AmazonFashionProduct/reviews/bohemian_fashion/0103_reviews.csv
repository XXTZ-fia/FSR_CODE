I love the length of this, and I love the colors on the sleeves. While I love wearing black, the pop of color is so cute! The versatility is great; I wear it at home and out. I like the weight of it as well because it’s not too heavy/hot to wear around the house. My major issue is that it pilled after the first wash. Human and pet hair also clings to the material. Because of this, I gave 3 stars. After the first wash, it already looked used and abused. Value for money: I personally think it’s too expensive (without a sale) due to the above.",
