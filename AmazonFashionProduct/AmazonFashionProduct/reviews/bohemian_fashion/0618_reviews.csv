Chanie Tee,Very Beautiful Dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30N6ZKQ100OUJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKHGMCBK,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 27, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: S Print Rose Multicolored,Verified Purchase,I purchased an XXL based on reviews and should have sized down for a more tapered waist look. For reference I am 5’3 and currently 200lbs. I am very curvy with an ample booty and 36H bra size. The con in getting the XXL is the waist was not tapered and I don’t have a large waist line or “Mommy Pouch”. A XL would have given me a better look. Even though it wasn’t as tapered as I would have liked it was still beautiful. The colors were very vibrant against my dark brown skin tone. The back is out but I wore a red bra so it blended with the dress. The front fit well without being too big. Someone suggested bra or clothing tape. I did not need it at all. If you have smaller cup size such as a DD or smaller and you need a XXL then the front may need to be held with a pin or broach. The length was perfect for me and if it was a bit shorter I would have been fine with it. I wore 3 1/2 inch red sandals. I am at my heaviest weight and plan to drop down in size in the next couple of months. I will repurchase in a size L and M to determine which fits better. I am going in a cruise and would like to wear this dress. I will gift this to someone else in the family.,

Sarah,Cute for smaller chested ladiess,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GO97B9LVXPFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKHGMCBK,"3.0 "," the United States "," April 11, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Green,Verified Purchase,"I originally purchased this dress for a bridal shower. I got the sage green color in size S and I am 130 lb 5'5 for reference. I was debating if I wanted to wear this or not due to the lack of support in the chest area. The way the dress dips into a deep V makes it a little challenging to wear a regular bra. I also want to note that the S was too big on me and I probably needed to size down to an XS so that had an impact on the tightness of the top part. It was super cute on, I will say but the only issue was that I felt a little too exposed in the chest area for a bridal shower. Maybe if I had a smaller size, it would have fit a little better in that area but I didn't have enough time to order a new one unfortunately. Very cute dress though, I would consider ordering a smaller size next time I had an event coming up.",6

This dress has quickly become my go-to for every occasion, and I can’t count the number of compliments I’ve received when I wear it. The deep V-neck and backless design give it a stunning, elegant flair, while the ruffle details add a playful touch. I loved it so much that I ended up buying it in multiple colors! It’s incredibly versatile—perfect for everything from work to weddings. I can easily dress it up with heels or keep it casual with flats, making it suitable for any event. The flowy fabric is super comfortable, and I always feel fabulous in it. Just a heads up—if you don’t have boobs bigger than a C cup, this might not fit as well. If you’re looking for a dress that combines style and comfort, this is definitely the one!",
Sean Bond,Beautiful dress! ...but only if you aren't sent a cheap one?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BIJ2LNSG9KNN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKHGMCBK,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 12, 2023",Size: LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"Short version: I love the dress! It's so lovely and fits great. Can't wait to wear it! Wouldn't mind ordering other colors in the future :)  Long version: I ordered this dress 3 times. I got it in 2 sizes to figure out which one fit best (L and XL). Had I not done that, I wouldn't have noticed that I was sent one good quality dress and one possibe knock off? If you check out the video I attached you'll see what I mean. The cheap one in size L has a more faded fabric, no lining on the back of the top, no elastic on the waist, and the seams on the shoulders, neckline, zipper, and along the sides of the skirt were crooked. It fit terribly. I only tried ordering again because the bigger size was was much nicer quality and fit better even though it was way too large. I made sure to order another before sending the poor quality one back, to make sure I wasn't just sent the bad one again. 3rd one in size L was the same good quality as the XL and fit great! So overall happy, but not thrilled I had to order it 3 times to figure that out.",111
Carla Stashin,Bigger Girl Approval,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R358BK01B7V212/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKHGMCBK,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 1, 2020",Size: X-LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"Overall, I like this dress a lot! It’s very cute, the fabric pattern (how the maker cut out the panels to make the dress) is really flattering! It looks cute, even though I’m a bigger girl and am super self-conscious. Thankfully, it covers my butt! Which is a rare thing in searching for dresses for me and other women who have more junk in the trunk. It also has white panels under the fabric, making it not see-through at the parts of your body you don’t want anyone seeing. I can wear a cami under this dress if I don’t want the cleavage and open back. I like that this dress is super light and frilly, especially where I live. I live in a dry hot climate that makes 100 degrees F the daily low in summer. The lightness of the material makes it really easy to wear in the summer. Now, let’s get to a few cons. The zipper on the back is kind of flimsy, so be careful when zipping and unzipping yourself from the dress. The cut also is lower in the front and higher in the back for junk-in-the-trunk women like myself, which makes me think that if the seller made alternations to the dress size range by adding plus sizes and making alterations to the making of the dresses for the new sizes, they would reach a higher market and women like myself would love to buy from them continuously. However, that’s just my opinion. I am on a weight loss journey and will likely lose weight, making the dress fit better and provide more coverage. I want to purchase the spaghetti-strap version because I like this dress so much and want a more everyday dress.",901

The waist had a beautiful detail ruffle which highlighted her figure and the sleeves are sheer so this dress offered coverage for the Fall weather and her modest nature but also had a light feel to fit in with the theme. She was very happy with the dress and the price point is completely worth it! She can also wear this dress on other occasions (I might even have to borrow it!).

I wore this to my mom’s milestone birthday celebration and felt pretty all day :-) I just ordered the brown/black version of this dress in Large. I wanted to try a larger size to see if it made any difference in the hang of the dress or how the back fits. The large gave me more room in the waist, which I did not need and don’t necessarily like. It did not provide more space in the breast area or the back, which I did not need but would not have minded at all. Overall this is a girly fun whimsical dress and I am happy with both of my purchases.",11

Not very stretchy material but I think I could have sized down from S to XS as the waist area was a little looser on me. Usually I'm a US size S.  5 stars because the color, fit, fabric, and lining was exactly as expected. Not see-through at all. Since it is polyester you should expect it to be a little less breathable than natural fibers, and I also found that it clung to my body a little bit from static and/or sweat. I've worn it maybe 10 times already and put it through the wash and line dried each time - still looks new!",3

Before trying it on I had already read the reviews and ordered some boob tape prior to me wearing it out. If you are a plus size girl like myself, I would suggest to order up 1 size if you’re busty or have broad shoulders like myself. I usually wear an XL, but will be ordering this and a 2XL. I received so many compliments in this dress and having the back out also made me feel even more sexier. I would’ve given this dress a 5 out of 5, but due to the size running a little bit smaller it receives a 4 out of 5 in my opinion.  After wearing this for a while, the material near the breast area began to unravel, please keep this in mind if you want to keep this dress, long-term.",189

I usually wear a size 12 in dresses, and ordered the Large.  The fit and the look of the dress is flattering, especially with the frilly look and the fitted waist in the bodice which accentuates my figure well.  I love the color of it with the soft medium blue and the little animal print pattern on it, it has a 60s/70s boho feel as well as a nod to the 80s with the animal print.  It really boosts my confidence wearing it.  I typically don't wear backless dresses, and it's a bold move for me, and I'm glad I took the plunge.  Very flattering dress on me.  It's feminine and flirty. :)The thing that can be difficult is buttoning the buttons from the back, it takes practice to get them secured properly, but thankfully the loops are stretchy enough that it allows the buttons to secure easier.  I'm a little less well-endowed on top, so I originally ordered a backless convertable pushup bra, and unfortunately the wing straps are still visible from the garment, so I will have to be like a hippie in 1969 and go braless or sew in cups, but it still looks great on me even when I'm a little thinner/unpadded with the girls.  It does fit a little snug in the waist part after I zipper the waist part, but it feels secure.  My husband likes the dress on me though, so it will be a date night fixture, even if it's a stay at home event due to Covid.  :)",5

I’m 5’2” 160 34/36DD and always wear a large but the medium was only available for fast next day shipping and I took a chance and omg!!! It fits perfectly, it is the perfect fit of a size 8 dress. It is not too short above the knee just perfect. The v cut fit just right with the comfortable coverage no bra needed it is backless and it provides coverage and support. This is a lovely dress and I will most definitely get it In different colors. It is well worth the price. I highly Recommend it for this summer and spring and fall. It is a beautiful well executed design. Love love love this dress!!!",35

I want to keep the blue really bad so I’m altering it lol - if you can’t fill it out it’s just not as pretty.

For reference I am 5’11” and it wasn’t uncomfortably short. There is not any stretch in the waist so stepping into the dress even with the zipper all the way down takes a little wiggling. But once it’s on it’s a great fit. The top could accommodate a little more bust as I wore it without a bra and if I was sitting the neck could be a little loose. If I were wearing it again for a full day I would probably get a little double sided fabric tape to keep the edges down. If you’re considering it it’s worth a try girl! 😉,14

I would buy it in multiple colors if I had more occasions to wear it to!! It's so flattering on the arms, and I don't have a picture of the back but the open back is sexy. I have a large butt so usually I'm worried about dresses riding up- this dress has a slip and I wasn't too worried about it riding up. It's so cute and absolutely love it. The deep cut in the front of the dress means you should either opt for no bra, or nip covers- so make sure you have those!",13

It does show a little cleavage and is open in the back, so I was able to wear a normal bra with a bandeau on top to make it a little bit more modest when needed. Unfortunately, after only three wears, there is a large tear on the side. The fabric makes it hard to stitch (for an amateur like me at least.) I hand wash and hang fragile items like this one, but it unfortunately still did not handle well.",

The fabric and pattern is super pretty and cute, the colors are soft and light. The ruffles are cute and the neck is low cut but it isn't like I am going to pop a titty out. The back is open but it isn't bad enough to show off rolls or backfat or anything like that. With a tan and wedges I think this dress will be so cute, but it is SUPER short on, so it isn't a dress that I will be bending over in or going out in a windy climate with, not unless I want everyone to see my peach.",198

The color of this dress is absolutely gorgeous and the fit is perfect! It hides any insecurities one may have, but also form fitting giving you a classy/confident fit & feel. I have a smaller chest and the V neck doesn't show too much, but shows enough ;) The material is great quality as well. You can wear it in the midst of summer without becoming too hot or sweaty! I have two weddings this weekend and next and will be ordering another one in a different color to have one for each wedding. If you're looking for a casual or formal dress, this one is a great option!  Size: M Height: 5'8"" Weight: 150 lbs Chest: B cup",3

I don’t find it flattering to see someone’s bra. So I chose not to wear a bra with it and man I was about to have a nip slip like no other.. going to try a Safeway pen to see if that will solve the problem.. wish it came with a clip to help cover the cleavage ..,

This is more of just a buyer beware if you tend to carry weight in your arms, this dress make your shoulder look very broad and isn’t all that flattering. I really wanted to love this dress because it looks great on so many body types and skin tones, but personally I really didn’t like the way the shoulders made me look boxy up top.",

The dress is super cute, but the material is thin. I ordered the green/sage color and I was disappointed to see that the inner lining was white instead of the sage color I saw in another review photo. The lining isn't such a big deal, but I think it would have made the dress look better. I'm pregnant and ordered my pre-pregnancy size (small). I wish I had sized up because my bump grew so much over the past month. I'm hoping to be able to use it after I give birth so I'll keep it. I can't say whether it is true to size or not, but if you're pregnant definitely size up bc it is not stretchy at all.",4

Thanks to all the previous buyers for posting! My one and only complaint, which may be the reason I return it, is there is absolutely NO give in the waist!! I’m pretty small and I’m even nervous about how tight it is. It zips from the back skirt part and then the top part is somewhat forgivable and giving around your shoulders. Other than that it is beautiful, flows as you walk, and perfect for summer! For reference: I’m 5’2”, normally wear a size 0-2 (bought a small). Hope that helps. I will add pictures, if I keep it.",
