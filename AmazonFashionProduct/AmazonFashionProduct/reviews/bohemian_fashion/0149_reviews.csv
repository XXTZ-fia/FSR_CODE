The color that I received does not look like the color online. The fabric is very cheap. Feeling the stitching is not that great on the top where the elastic band is and it just wasn’t what I was expecting. Hopefully the seller can either reimburse me or give me credits because I am currently living in a rehab facility and I do not have the original packaging anymore and I don’t have transportation now or for when I get out so I won’t be able to return it so I’m counting on the seller to reimburse me or something. Thank you.,2

S. Guy,It’s ok but I’m disappointed in quality. The straps are hidden!

I’m disappointed in the pocket size. It’s not the full size of the outer stitching but rather 1/2 of that. Technically, an iPhone 14 Pro Max can fit in it laying sideways and I think not fall out. That’s a big * …. I have pants with pockets and a similar style, and they are much bigger. Since this is basically the same design, I thought they would be the same. On the black skirt, the fabric is very thin, almost see-through. I did expect a slightly thicker, better quality fabric for the price. All in all, I think it’s just OK. I’m considering using it for a Renfaire skirt, but I don’t think it’s good enough quality to wear for every day use.",

I am in love with it. I bought a second color for a cruise. I am six feet tall and it is long almost to the ground. Sometimes I trip over with the hem so long and have to lift it up using the strings on the side. Easy to pull and no damage with the use. The material is cotton and easy to iron out the wrinkles. I have never dried in the dryer so I am not sure about shrinkage. I won’t take the chance. Light weight and works well with most things. I wear with converse sneaker or sandals in my hot temperature. This is a must have in a wardrobe. Perfect for women trying to be more modest as well.,2

IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING BUY IT! I purchased the red/auburn color.  For my plus size girlies it works!!! Ok i am a thick girl usually wear 18 or 20 in bottoms or XXL And about 2XL or 3XL in tops depending on its cut. I was skeptical purchasing this since it is one size but seriously it so roomy and flowing. There is an elastic band so it stretches however, the waistband is a bit petite. It works perfect for me so i would be mindful if you are heavier in the mid-section. AND BONUSSSSS IT HAS POCKETS, DEEP POCKETS.  This boho style skirt is soooo cute and flowy and perfect on a hot summer day, material almost feels like linen so it is very breathable, also i am only 5'5 so it is long however, i wear it high waist with a cute crop denim shirt.",15
