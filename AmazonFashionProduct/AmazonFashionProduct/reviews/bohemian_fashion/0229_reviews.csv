Alena Cooper,"Eh, so/so",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EPG82XZUT7O9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09C3GHQMX,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Size: One SizeColor: Copper,Verified Purchase,"I wanted to like this because the color is really pretty. But the material is heavy and awkward. It’s not warm at all but it’s just this weird denim canvas type of heavy material that would have no flow or movement. But it also felt like I would rip easily. The pockets were oddly placed and the drawstring was so weird and unflattering and would probably get hooked on everything. At 5’2” it was a tad long on me. I’m also not sure how this is a one size fits all. I’m slender at 5’2”, 100lbs, 24” waist, 30” hip and this skirt was actually tight enough at the waist that there was some stretch to it when I expected it to probably just fit without having the waist stretch. And the bad part is that the waist doesn’t have that much give to it to accommodate a bigger stomach, at least not without probably snapping the stitching. I liked the color enough that if this skirt has been what it is actually worth- probably like $20- I may have kept it. But at over double that price I could not justify keeping something that is so poorly made and awkward just because I loved the orange color of the copper one. If it ever goes on major sale I’d probably buy it again. I’ve tried several different styles of skirts from this brand and I’ve returned them all because I have about the same feeling on each one. I definitely won’t purchase this brand again unless they drop the price to something that reflects what it is actually worth. Again $20 max would be reasonable.",

The elastic waist band does in fact expand large enough to fit like an XL comfortably.  The color is nice too - I got the rust one.
