Sadly, on the yellow top, the hem at one point did not have the edge stitching done properly, and it is unraveling.  Since I bought many of the tops, I did not attempt to wear this particular one until after the return time had passed my 3 days.  Unfortunately, I now have a beautiful top that I will not be able to wear, and cannot return.Now to give an overall  review of these tops.  I have purchased many of this style, {there are two styles  available, and I am talking about the ones that have long sleeves} and I love them.  I love that they are a free flowing, lovely chiffon fabric with amazing designs.  I have washed them, and they have laundered beautifully in my washer with cold water.  I have dried them either by hanging, or on a delicate cycle in the dryer. I have worn them with dress slacks, as well as jeans, and they adapt to whatever you are wearing.  I did not realize when buying them that there are two ways you can wear the sleeves.  One is to put your hands and arms through the finished opening provided, or if you want more arm coverage, you are able to have that opening serve as a ""peek sleeve"" and put your hand and arm through the lower opening.  I will wear these tops in all seasons of the year.  I hope at a future time there may be more of this style with other beautiful designs.",
