I ordered this skirt in yellow, blue, red, and turquoise. I just ordered in this pink/violet and the fabric is totally different…. It’s feels… thin but slippery and plasticky with a lot of static cling. I took a picture next to one of the other skirts and when you blow it up you can see how different the fabric is. The pink/violet is awful. Even though it’s light weight i know it will just cling to your legs and cause you to sweat. Not to mention there was a huge hole in the seam. I’m definitely returning this one. That said, I don’t know why there was a difference with this one because the other ones I have are great- it’s why I wanted more.",

A lot of reviews have complained of loose threads - mine has them too but to me they look normal manufacturing “leftovers” and would not likely affect the longevity of the garment.

However, the position of the top tier seam causes issues. The skirt fits tighter around the top tier seam, and when you move, it causes the skirt to bunch up between that tier seam and the waistband giving a pregnancy look, unless you keep smoothing it down and pulling the seam down. Going up a size may correct the issue, but I honestly, think the top tier seam needs to be lower. I returned the skirt.",4
