The style of the shirt is flattering to those of us who have mom stomachs.  It does remind me of a maternity shirt but I still like the flowy nature of the bottom of the shirt and the empire waist.  It makes me feel less conscious about my stomach.  I have gotten several compliments about the shirt from coworkers and my husband.  The pattern is pretty.  I like the detail of the elastic at the cuffs with the ruffle at the wrist.  I appreciate that the sleeves are flowy but not puffy at the shoulder.  There is stretch to this shirt and as other reviewers pointed out the pattern does stretch out as does the color so make sure you pick a size where the shirt isn't stretching too much over the bust.,5

Maybe that says more about the way I'm shaped than about the garment. For me, it just wasn't the best fit.
