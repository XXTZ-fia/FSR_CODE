They are Women’s Plus Size Tunics. If they had it one size bigger I probably would have exchanged them for that because I like when things are a little bigger on me and don’t hug my body so much but this was doable so I let them be. I think I got 3 of them in different patterns for a good price. They do stretch and are comfortable and the colors are true and bright. They don’t shrink upon washing in cold water but I don’t know about drying because we drip dry our clothes and only use the dryer for towels and such. While I would say this is a bit clingy around the breast, waist and butt area it didn’t bother me in my neck or arms which is usually my problem areas.",
