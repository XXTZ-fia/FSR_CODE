It is a little see through but if you wear your nude undergarments you’ll be fine. The fit is absolutely fantastic! The two things I would say about it though is that the area underneath the chest is loose and that after it is zipped and tied you can’t really lift your arms. I think that’s partially on me though. I should’ve gotten a bigger size to be able to raise my arms and have more room in the back, but if I had gotten a bigger size, it would’ve been even looser in the chest, however if you can fill the chest area out it looks great. Even though the zipper is small, it is smooth, barely noticeable, and easy to zip. The fabric is so nice and high quality. Highly recommended!",
