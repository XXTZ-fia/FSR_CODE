Very flattering, and fits just right- not tight but not boxy. The length is perfect- not tunic length but longer than many shirts that only go to belt. I love the bit longer sleeves, still short sleeves but just a tad longer, and not oversized/wide  at all.",

The color to me is more like a medium teal green instead of a leaf green. The pattern and the color are both very pretty.  And the size fits as expected. You could wear this with slacks or a skirt or it will go equally as well with jeans. The material is soft and drapes nicely. They have now lowered the price so that makes it even better. It was $19.99 at the time I ordered it. The price now is more in line with what a shirt like this should cost. I like it.,

The only thing that  keeps the shirt from being five stars for me is the neckline.  The v-neck is just a bit off center.  Cute shirt!",

She has a 5'4 buxom apple-shaped figure that fits a size XL or 14-16 in tops. She has to wear a higher-neck bra since the neckline gapes on her, when she even slightly bends down. She does like the cotton-like texture of this polyester top though. Attractive Floral Navy colors too. True to how it looks on the model of the Amazon product photos.  I recommend sizing down by 1.",

The fit was true to size and very comfortable. The color was very similar as shown on the website. It comes in two dozen other colors both solid colors and various prints. The top went through the washer and dryer well with no skrinkage.  Of course the top does not look as good on me as it does on the models. I wish that manufacturers would show their tops on average women so that you could get a better idea on how the shirts fit on various body types.,4

The banded collar is a nice touch, keeping the neckline from stretching or rolling out. The three-button V-neck style feels a bit dressier than a simple T-shirt, and I love the soft material and vibrant color mix. It’s a versatile top I can wear to work or dress down for a casual day.",4
DLL,Not as good as expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJWZPE63232ZT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLH4XCDG,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2024",Color: Floral Black MultiSize: X-Large,,I ordered this shirt for my wife. I am a bit disappointed with it. It fits as it should. The material is soft and comfortable. The problem is the colors are not very good. It really looks nothing like the ad pictures. The colors are dull and don't stand out. Instead of being a nice dressy top it is going to be just an everyday wear around shirt. Not near as good as it should have been.,

The medium light material is stretchy and comfortable, and the print is a nice departure from my usual solid-colored tee. I ordered a Large instead of my recommended Small so it wouldn't be tight across my 38C chest and, while it's a bit loose around the middle (28W), it looks nice tucked in, or out for a more casual wear.
