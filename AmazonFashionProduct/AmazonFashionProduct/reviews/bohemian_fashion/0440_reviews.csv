I was a bit confused though...one pic showed a v-neck and another a plunging neckline.  The fabric is great. The length is perfect. The pattern is gorgeous.  However, the deep plunge coupled with my bust size makes it impossible for me to comfortably wear this dress in public. And I'm not a prude by any stretch of the imagination.  And maybe it would be awesome for someone with less décolletage or more confidence in flaunting ""the girls.""  But for me, this is a no-go. I wish both pictures had been accurate or the v-neck pic was removed so I could have known full well what I was buying. (In which case, I wouldn't have...)",

The only thing I don’t like is its low cut so I will have to wear a tank top under it for work.  I thought the elastic neckline was gonna be kinda weird but it’s ok and is comfortable.  I like the length (I’m 5’5”) and its true to size (I normally wear 12/14).  The color is really nice and bright so could definitely wear this in the spring with sandals or fall with booties!

Thank goodness it has pockets too!  Its a really cute dress.  Its described as being for a wedding, I would consider this for a beach wedding, or a more casual setting.  I find it more appropriate for a nice night out, or a barbecue, or a birthday party.  The material is lightweight and I like the print very much.",
