I normally wear a ladies size 12, am 5'7, 155 lbs, 40x33x40.  The size Large would have been right for me, but usually things with no size chart run small on Amazon (at least in my experience) so I sized up.  That's my mistake, but a size chart would have helped avoid that.  2) This fabric, while feeling great and offering a flattering drape, looks a little cheap.  It is a touch shiny and the color saturation is not great.  If the pigmentation were stronger it wouldn't matter that it was a little shiny.  If the dress was matte in finish, it wouldn't matter that the pigment isn't so deep, but the combination leaves a little to be desired.",3

I am very happy with the fit (I am 5'2 and a 8/10 in women's sizing).  The navy is beautiful and I love the white and pink details on the print. The dress is nice and light weight. I have washed and dried it once with no fading or shrinking. I am definitely going to order in more colors!!,

Poppy Lou,Love this Dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KCJ1MQ16D5L8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CT8RR4MJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 28, 2024",,,"I got this dress, thinking it would be something to wear around the house.  It is so much better than that.  It's a very flattering dress and it has pockets!  It's a little loose but it still looks so nice. I should have ordered down one size. I'm 5'2"" and it hits just below my knee which is where I usually wear dresses.It's a very pretty print and the material is very comfortable.  While the material seems thin, it's not see-through and it looks better than the price would have you believe. Honestly, I didn't think it would be this good.  I've washed it, hung it to dry and there are no wrinkles.  I can't say that about most of my wardrobe.  It's a plus that I don't need to iron it. This is a beautiful casual dress.",

Shari M.,Baggy and unflattering,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PXLPOGCQCF7A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CT8RR4MJ,"2.0 "," the United States "," March 16, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Deep Blue Floral,,"Wow. I am so bummed about this dress. The fabric does not feel like the fabric it's supposed to be, it feels more like a cotton polyester blend which is not what I was looking for with this dress. It also isn't nearly as fitted. The whole thing is just basically a baggy house dress. It makes me look like a little old lady and I don't like that one bit! Big bummer. It looks so pretty in the picture, and although the pattern is identical, the look of the dress itself isn't even close.",

Annie T,Cute summer dress.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34Y5JQ6BTDFVE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CT8RR4MJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 14, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black White Floral,,"I got the black and white floral and I love the graduation of the print from polka dot on the bodice to a floral at the skirt.  The fabric has a light stretch to it and it easily goes on over the head without snaps, buttons, or zips.  The dress has a jewel neckline which is high, but it doesn’t feel snug or uncomfortable.  They call the sleeves petal sleeves.  We always called them tulip sleeves, but I think they’re both accurate descriptions.  They’re very pretty and add a nice touch to an otherwise simple dress design.  The dress hangs from the shoulders and is very loose and comfortable without looking tent-like.  I’m 5’ 8” tall and I feel like the dress is a little on the short side for me.  It hits me about 2 ½ to 3 inches above the knee.  It’s not extremely short though, especially for a summer dress.  It has pockets on both sides that are a nice size, but the fabric is so light that if I put something as heavy as my phone in them, the extra weight pulls heavily at the dress.  They’re nice for things like a lipstick though.",4
