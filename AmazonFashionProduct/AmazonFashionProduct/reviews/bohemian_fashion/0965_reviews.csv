The material is soft, and the pattern is really pretty in person.  I like the cut through the body, where it is slightly loose and flowy, but you can feel the little bit of stretch and cling.  The arm length is good, and the shoulders have shape without being too puffy.  I especially like the detail at the front neckline area, it adds a nice level of ""fancy"".  I received several compliments the first time I wore this top.",

This shirt makes me look much bigger than I am, and actually accentuated the baggy waist and belt area.  It also puffs out in the back making me look like I have a humped back.  The small size is very big on me even though the sizing chart said it would be a fit.  Horrible fit for someone with a smaller frame.  Would probably be much nicer on a tall lady or fuller figured woman.",4

It covers my butt just enough in the back and hangs nicely around my big hips. The shoulders fit nicely and the sleeves look nice.  I think I'll order a couple other colors. This will give me something other than big t-shirts to wear come summer.",

Customer Review,Floral multi white tee puff sleeve spring and summer top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROIV4D4NYLRLI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLH5S646,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Color: Floral Multi WhiteSize: XX-Large,,"The white tee with floral multi-print is feminine and pretty. The bubble sleeves are cute, but the cuff could be snug on those with larger arms. Wash on cold with like colors, stain treat if needed, no bleach, and tumble dry on medium heat. The way this was made, the top is pleated, giving the middle and bottom of the shirt a flowy style and can hide any mommy tummy or muffin top figure flattering for all ladies. The square neck allows for some skin to show off without cleavage busting out, and room for displaying chokers and shorter chain necklaces to be a focal point of accessories. The flowers are bright and cheerful and could be worn year-round if you prefer but there are so many designs to choose from so pick out a few if you love them they will make a nice wardrobe staple and work appropriately where you're allowed to wear printed shirts, but there are some nice solids if that is not the case. Can be worn with khakis, jeans, shorts, skirts, but probably not leggings unless you like the hiney showing.",

It made me feel so pretty -- I pray other women can be blessed by this shirt too! The sleeves are the poofy type that are in style, but they are not overly puffy like so many nowadays (putting on 10 lb). The only little drawbacks are that it is a tad see through, so you need to wear a tank top under it.",

Only con is that many of the floral patterns are cheap and gaudy looking (I did like the burgundy one however)-I prefer something more subtle, but this is just my preference-not worth deducting a star. Overall a nice choice for casual wear.",

The fabric is soft and hangs nicely, and the inside is a whitish color. I chose the size large, and it's comfortable and fairly true to size (maybe a bit on the small side). The pleating is nice and they did a good job with the stitching. There are no hanging threads to trim. It's obviously a top that's best for warm weather, and it can be worn casually or to work settings. The style is suited for all ages and figures, and I recommend getting one for yourself or a friend. With the endless colors and prints, anyone can find a version that they'll like.",

I barely knew I was wearing it, it’s that comfy!  I love the scoop neck, it’s defined and sets this top apart from the other tops in my closet.  What I didn’t realize at time of purchase is that the sleeves are actually cuffed. The cuffs give the sleeves shape and I appreciate the full coverage of the upper arm. The shirt fits nicely around my hips and I believe the pattern of the fabric works well with the overall style and I feel like I look nice in it.",9
