The cut at the bottom of the pants makes for a unique and trendy look.  I ordered a size up on my last two pairs because the elastic waist band from my first pair felt a little tighter than I’d like, I think because the waist band is thick.

Because they’re never quite the same as they are when these girls do their “Amazon hauls”. I’m literally thinking of applying for an Amazon LTK link because I am ALL about those dupes and I get dozens of Amazon packages a week. 😅 Oops.  So- the pants. I ordered my regular size, an XS, and the first thing I wish it had was a drawstring waist. Also, the inseam from the elastic to the crotch is extremely long, which is usually great for me because I have a long torso, but they just didn’t fit right whether they were on my hips or on my waist. They were also a bit scratchy, definitely not the super soft pants you want to lounge around in, but maybe washing would help?  I did like the color and the deep pockets, and I loved the tapered overlapping bottom, which gave them some cute boho style. They’re breathable, which is great for my AZ “fall/winter” season when it could be 98 degrees or it could be 49.
