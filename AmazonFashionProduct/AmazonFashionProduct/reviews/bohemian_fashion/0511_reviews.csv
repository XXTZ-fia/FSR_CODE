The fabric itself has no stretch, either, so this is not a forgiving, easy garment.  The fabric itself is nice - a good weight, and not sheer, which is good if you wear this as a dress.  Sizing up is necessary if you want any ease in the bust, empire waist, shoulders/back -- there's plenty of room in the body and hips, as there's a gather at the waistline. The (unfortunate) effect with the top of this garment being a bit snug is that I end up looking pregnant in it. It's not a good look for me at my post-menopausal, salt-and-pepper hair stage of life! ;)  So here's my take on this: IF it's large enough to fit well, it's awesome - a ""5 star"" for sure. Because the sizes run small, I gave it three stars as just average. Now I need to decide whether to return it or not! If I drop my ""covid 20"" from Covid-19 inactivity, it would fit much better.",4
