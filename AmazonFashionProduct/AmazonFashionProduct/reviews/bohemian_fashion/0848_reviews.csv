The thread was just hanging loosely as if it wasn't sewn on properly to begin with.  The print on the fabric was as described, however the fabric itself felt somewhat cheap and less-than-desirable quality.  The notes on the product listing recommend ordering a size up as they may run small, so I initially considered getting a ""large"". But then the size suggested by Amazon (based on my size in other brands) was a ""small"", which is size down from my usual. So I settled on a ""medium"" as this is what I'd normally pick anyway. It was a weird fit, way too loose in the middle section, almost made me look pregnant... but I feel like if I sized down, the bottom of the pants would sit too high. Not the worst fit, but definitely not great either.  Overall, if it wasn't for the buttons falling off, I might have been okay wearing it. I just feel for the price, there are better quality options out there.",
