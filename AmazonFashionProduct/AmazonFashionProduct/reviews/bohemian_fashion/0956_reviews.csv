I thoroughly enjoyed wearing them in the very hot and humid weather. Very thin, see thru in sunlight (even in black) or if what you're wearing underneath is darker than the color/pattern of the jumper. Washed and dried perfectly, no shrinkage. I'm 5'7"", 165lbs, 38C and I bought Mediums. They were all about the same size with slight length discrepancies in each but that didn't bother me. They hung just above the top of my feet and looked great with chunky sandals, platforms and wedges. Completely flat sandals made them drag at times so if you're shorter I would avoid flats in a size Medium. They did ""grow"" a bit as the day progressed which for me, wasn't an issue since I was not looking for tight fitting clothes in that type of weather. I think they look better as a late spring & summer jumper because of how thin they are which makes tanks and tees look best underneath.",8
