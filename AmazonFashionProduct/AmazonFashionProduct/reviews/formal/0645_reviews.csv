What I didn’t like is there is so much extra material with the back pockets and it make it look wrinkly and baggy in back.

They’re very breathable too, the event was outdoors and I felt comfortable in high & low 70 degree weather with a mix of walking, sitting, & standing. I do recommend sizing down from your normal size. At the moment I’m between sizes 8 & 10, I needed to size down to a medium instead of a large so I wasn’t “swimming” in the pants. The fabric seems to pill in some areas so be mindful of that when caring for them. These are a new staple in my corporate wardrobe.",

I’m not sure I’ll be able to wear shapewear with these without them falling off my behind. The material is much thinner than I expected, light penetrates it pretty easily. The part that bothers me most is the length. I haven’t measured the inseam to see if it’s accurate to what was advertised, but these are supposed to be long, and if I wear them at my true waist, they’re mighty short. I already have a short torso too, so I was confused by this. If I adjust them to sit as if they’re low-rise, it works okay. We’ll see how they hold up after the first wear.",4

Thankfully I didn’t even take the pants out of the packaging or else I would’ve been exposed to this possibly hazardous chemical. I also noticed the strong odor. I immediately washed my hands and put it in a big ziplock to contain it. The worst part is when I called Amazon to inform them, the response was for me to mail it back or take a photo. I asked why take a photo if it won’t show anything? You can barely see the moisture on the packaging, and I didn’t want to further expose myself by handling it further. I was hesitant to mail it back because when asked “Is anything hazardous in this package?” by the mail service, how can I honestly reply? It could be hazardous! It could be flammable! I don’t want that liability. I ended up taking photos of the pants in the package. It’s been a few days and still NO REPLY from Amazon.

Time will tell whether the fabric holds up, but I don't mind so much right now. We'll see if my review changes.  I had to size down from medium to a small with these pants. Like one reviewer mentioned, there's a lot of material at the front of the pants which could potentially be unflattering. However, sizing down helped. Additionally, I appreciate the elastic waist in the back in addition to the zipper/ button front. This will allow for some flexibility with weight changes during my midlife struggles. I do wonder if the zippers will hold up. They're okay for now, but I question their durability. For this price point, I can deal with it as long as these pants don't fall apart after only a few wears. I do love how it looks and the pant length.

If I wear them at my waist, the hem is a couple inches above the ankle. If I wear them lower, the front bunches out and looks a bit odd.  I still wear them, and I think they’re a great pant if you’re not on the taller side. They can be dressed up or down and wash up easy.",9

Even the length is manageable with a little bit of a platform shoe. I love the elastic in the waistband for more allowance (I can eat what I want and they won’t be too tight)! The material blend is also great for spring and summer outfits. I bought the “Light Grey” color and it’s more of a grey/beige mix, but I was simply looking for a neutral color and it met my standards. I will absolutely be buying a few more pairs!",16

The front pockets aren't boy deep, but they're respectable. The back pockets just seem to pooch out in a weird way, which adds an odd sort of lumpy look to your expanded butt.
