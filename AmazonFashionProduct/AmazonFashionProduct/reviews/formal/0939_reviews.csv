The wrinkle-free feature is one of the highlights—no ironing needed after washing, which is always a plus.  The fit is just right. It’s not too tight or baggy, and I appreciate that tall sizes are available for those who need extra sleeve or body length. The classic spread collar is versatile enough for both formal events and casual outings. I’ve paired this shirt with a tie for a business meeting and also worn it open with sleeves rolled up for a more relaxed look. It transitions seamlessly between different occasions, which is great for someone who doesn’t want to maintain separate wardrobes for work and social events.  The quality of this shirt is evident in its details. It comes in a range of colors, making it easy to mix and match with different outfits. I haven’t noticed any issues with fading or shrinking after washing. For care, I’ve just machine-washed and hung it up right out of the dryer—no hassle, and it’s ready to wear.  Overall, this is a solid dress shirt that combines practicality with style. It’s ideal for business settings, casual outings, or even more formal occasions. Whether you need a reliable shirt for work or something stylish for an event, this one delivers.",

It fits him well and he really likes the color. I washed this and took it out right away and hung it to dry. It wrinkled like crazy! I had to iron it but it looks nice now. Not my favorite because of all the work I have to do, but he won't be wearing it every day. Good price for what it is. It's not see through, it's typical material, and good quality.",

The way that it fits is also very nice, as it falls against your body beautifully. I thought it was French cuff from just looking at the picture, but it’s not, and you’ll know that if you read and don’t just look at pictures like me. But the color is so beautiful and bright that you’ll get plenty of compliments whilst wearing these shirts!",

Made from a blend of 40% cotton and 60% polyester, it offer just the right mix of softness and durability. What’s impressive is how the shirt manage to stay wrinkle-free, plus it's so easy to to care for.  I love the classic spread collar, a great feature—it pairs perfectly with a tie or bow tie, making these shirts suitable for both business and casual settings. You can wear it easily in an office setting or straight to dinner or a social event without needing a change.  The variety of colors available allows for plenty of mix-and-match opportunities, which is fantastic for a fresh and versatile wardrobe. I was impressed by this yellow color, it wasn't bad at all, and pairs nicely with denim or dress pants.  The big plus, the promise of customer satisfaction and support from the merchant gives you peace of mind it's a worthwhile investment.",

Stephen.R,very nice looking dress shirt..,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FYZ7OQCFDFNV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8THHCCW,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 22, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: 00097_mustard,,"I have not had an occasion to wear this shirt yet as it is still a bit hot here in Texas. I did try it on after opening it and I am very happy with the fit. I am 6'3"" 195# and the XL was the right size for me. It is a very vibrant color (mustard yellow) and one that I did not have in my collection of dress shirts. It arrived in a plastic baggie vacuum packed and wrinkled beyond belief, but after being on a hanger for a few days the majority of wrinkles fell out. The quality of construction is very good, and I did not find any loose threads or stitches. I like the way the collar stays, and it should look good with a tie. I tried it on with a t-shirt underneath, but the material feels ok next to my skin and I could wear it without. The buttons are a similar in color to the shirt and not the cheap white or tortoise shell looking buttons on so many cheap shirts. The button holes are very tight and a bit difficult to button up the first time I tried it on. I am not sure if this will relax with continued use, but I thought it was worth mentioning. I really do like this shirt and the price at the time of this review is very good. I can definitely recommend it for what you get for $16.00. Now I just need to wait for Texas to cool down a bit and I will proudly be wearing this shirt.....",
