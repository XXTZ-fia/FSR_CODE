Jean-Pierre,Fantastic price for a quality shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DHPWENDFNAK4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDWY75TW,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Size: MediumColor: White,,"This may not be the very best shirt out there, but it's a very good shirt on its own. It has a reasonably high percentage of cotton in the blend, and being nearly half synthetic fibers, it has reasonable wrinkle resistance.  The big point in this shirt's favor? Look at the price: you could spend three times at a department store for this same quality.",

The fit is about as expected and the stretch is a welcome bonus. I do suggest wearing an undershirt as it is a bit thin and does show skin time pretty well. The collar lays down pretty well even without a tie on. It has a slim fit shape to it, unlike a lot of the business shirts I wear, it's a bit different but modern and I like it.",

The stretchy and soft fabric feel nice and fit well. I prefer this as a casual shirt to wearing it with a tie due to the smaller collars and no collar stays.  The shirt is on the thinner side which means you’ll see an undershirt underneath. The fit is as expected.  For size reference: I’m 5’7 and 180lbs. I usually wear size medium or 16 ½ (32/33) in a button down and this fits as expected.  Overall, this is a decent shirt, it’s priced very competitively, and I especially like the stretchy feel. I wouldn’t mind having this in the darker colors.",

The cotton poly blend is a little bit see through so don't wear a contrasting undershirt underneath. I ordered a size up and it fits really loose on me though, I usually wear a medium. The large fits me in the chest and belly, but the large is pretty wide in the shoulders. If you're a wide dude, then order a size up. If not, get your normal size. As for the fabric, it's more of the ""fast-fashion"" kind of fabric if you know what I mean. It's the sort of thing where you need this shirt for one or two occasions and you need it RIGHT NOW.  Overall it is suiting my purposes and I'm happy with it.",
