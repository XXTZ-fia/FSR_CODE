The fabric feels like a scratchy 5 dollar t-shirt. Usually one of Coofandy’s only strengths is soft fabric. Not this time.  The lines on the shirt that make it look fashionable and like you could wear it to work or out on the town in the pictures? Looks like silver glitter glue was slapped on there with a stencil. It’s just ugly and not comfortable.  The fit and the cut were good. I’ll give them credit for that. A little more efforts and a few bucks in materials would have made this a really nice shirt.  It came and remains a wrinkled mess.,

As previously reported the shirt does wrinkle easily, but rubbing it makes the wrinkles less annoying.  The small checks in the cuff and color are another annoyance.  The contras does NOT add to the look of the shirt and is in conflict with shirt shadow diamond pattern. ONE MORE THING.  This shirt DOES NOT HAVE A POCKET.  I think it is time the women's blouse makers stopped trying to make men's dress shirts.  A pocket is a customary item in any quality men's DRESS shirt.  Over priced for the material and design.

I normally wear my sleeves rolled up. 🤷‍♂️ I really like how it fit around the waist. Was not tight but didn’t not look like I was wearing a trash bag around me. So I washed them. Hoping they would not of shrunk…. They are 100% cotton. They shrink a fair amount. The arms are now about 3” short. The waist is form fitting now. Just not possible to wear. I should have gotten an XL but then would have probably had a trash bag around the waist. So I think I’ll just go to the store and try on shirts. Cause that was an expensive mistake. They seem to be of good quality. But not quite the fit I wanted after the wash. All in all worth the money if 1 you can get your size right 2 don’t mind a bag fit once you get them large enough.
