We thought it would be short lived with all the danglies but so far it's held up great, and she wears it to kindergarten about once a week and it normally just ends up in the normal wash.  She typically wears leggings underneath it because she likes to.  I thought that it would be itchy but she hasn't complained about that at all.  From the playground to the runway, this is a great dress.  We've ordered quite a few things from Grace Karin and all their products have been awesome.",

Bonus points for the matching hair tie with a sequined bow! It’s those little touches that make it feel extra special.  Overall, this dress hits the mark on quality, style, and appropriateness.

I bought it way bigger than she needed, because I know that she will wear it until there is no dress left. When I gave this one to her, she grabbed it and ran around the house screaming with delight then immediately after had to put it on. Since that moment she had refused to take it off because it makes her ""look like a princess."" Made great, amazing look, and worth the price.",
