The deep burgundy color is so beautiful and the lace actually matches perfectly.  The lace detail on the chest is cut a little low and you can see through it, but I have no issue with that. When I want to cover up a little more for meetings, I put on a complimentary neck scarf and it isn’t noticeable at all.  The lace sleeves add that special touch that elevates this blouse from being boring.  The fabric washes well.  I wash mine in cold water and line dry.  I would highly recommend this blouse.",
Cin,"Good cut, fabric a little thin",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M00FFIED60ZZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D97YDCQR,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 26, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Blue01,,"This shirt would be great for church or work in a warm place. I thought the sleeves would provide a little warmth but they don’t really, so this would be great for people that get warm. Or if you want to cover your arms in summer. The lace is a bit stiff so feels a little weird.  The cut is nice and flattering. I’m 5” 4’ and 140 pounds and the medium fits perfect.",
Mary Tuttle,I reordered a bigger size and these are poor quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1N6GXTK1IUP1L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D97YDCQR,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 18, 2024",Size: LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,I reordered a bigger size of the white and black and they are so wrinkled I can’t get them out.,

It is a great top for work or going out and can be paired with jeans, dress pants or a long skirt.  I like that it is stylish and not super revealing.  For having ""lace"" sleeves though, this fabric is pretty hot and I definitely would wear this on cooler days.  It does not have any stretch to it.  The biggest issue I have had is that the mesh sleeves, while really pretty, seem to snag on everything and then have little catches in them.  I guess this is hazard with wearing this kind of fabric but I was just disappointed that this shirt will not last a long time because I do really love the fit and style of it.",
David Tullio,Love this!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RELU6C4WZ9U4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D97YDCQR,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 27, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Blue01,,"I love the way this shirt fits! It is exactly what I expected. The color of the fabric is very pretty, the cutouts on the arms give it a little personality without being over the top. It lays nice and is the right length. Very flattering and it really brings out my eyes. So happy to add this to my wardrobe!",

I like the sheerness to the sleeves and the modern colors.  This goes well with capris or with jeans if you want to dress down a bit.  It is true to size, so a size medium will fit up to a 160lbs women and a size large will fit up to 175lbs woman.  This blouse has no adjustments so get your size.  This sits about 4 inches below your waist and sleeves are roomy and sheer.  The sheerness of the blouse sleeves will give you a more slimmer silhouette.",

XYZ,Solid material is a crinkled texture,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ROQ0I1I87J6Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D97YDCQR,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 3, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Blue01,,This is a really cute shirt that can be dressy with a skirt or more casual with jeans. I was a little surprised that the main part of the shirt was a crinkled material. Unless you really zoom in on the website picture you don’t realize that (see my attached pic). I still like it but would have preferred a smooth textured material. I do really like the lace sleeves and neckline. I ordered a medium according to the size chart and it fit pretty well. The sleeves were just barely long enough. I think the sleeves would have been too short if I had ordered a small. (I’m 5’7”.)  I ordered the Blue01 and the color was as shown on the website site. It washes well and with only a few wrinkles I was able to iron those out with a low heat iron.,2
Emmalee J,Short sleeves,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Y9HU243WSQ8K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D97YDCQR,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 3, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Blue01,,"This is a nice shirt to throw on but yet still look a little more dressy in everyday errands. I love the vibrant color too!  I normally wear a M for tops, so I got my normal size. However, the top is more fitted than I expected. If you want the looseness of the model photo, you'd have to go one or even 2 sizes up. It is not baggy enough in the midsection (or long enough length) for me to tuck in the front and leave the rest of the way around out. If you planned to tuck it into dress pants or a skirt though and wear under a blazer or something, then go with your normal size for a more fitted shirt.  Also, the sleeves run a bit on the short side. I would almost say they're more like a 7/8 sleeve rather than a true long sleeve shirt.. it's not short enough to be a 3/4 sleeve, but it would be great if you have a watch and/or bracelets that you want to be visible as part of your outfit. With arms down by my side, the sleeves leave my watch visible still. And when you lift your arms straight out in front of you, several inches of your arm will show (pictured). Sizing up a size or 2 for a more baggy fit may help if the sleeve length is a concern.",2

The color is true to the photos online, and the size is spot on (I ordered a small and it fits perfectly-it's definitely a true to size or slightly smaller small-definitely does not run large). The pleats and sleeves make the shirt interesting and cute. It is also very lightweight but not incredibly see through.",

I measure 37-31.5-41.  I don't love the material on the torso, but it's still cute. I like the lace on the sleeves and chest. There are two buttons at the wrist to adjust the size there which is nice. Material is thin so it would work for a summer to fall transition.  Being busty, I couldn't wear this to work because of the chest lace, but if you're smaller in the chest you probably could. I'll likely wear it to dinner or something.",
Rebekah Brown,So pretty and fits well,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2M9PISS98OIF7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D97YDCQR,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 22, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Blue01,,Great for a summer day where you need to be dressed up.

Customer BLJ,"Cute top, cool enough for summer",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RWF85A10BYG4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D97YDCQR,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 21, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Burgundy,,"I think this top is really cute, it looks just like the picture. The fabric is on the thinner side, which paired with the sleeve cutouts made this perfect for a cooler summer day (70s not 90s) and I'm sure it'll be great for early fall too. It is pretty loose fitting, so if you want a more form-fitting/snug shirt, I would recommend sizing down. The looser fit is perfect for me, as I got it to tuck into jeans/shorts/skirts. The front cutout is a bit plunging, so make sure you are ok with that/have a bra that can accommodate that.",
SB,Always size down with Blooming Jelly,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NGGY98HKE3B7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D97YDCQR,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 19, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Burgundy,,"I am 5'1"", measurements 39-33-38.  I got a few Blooming Jelly shirts in the past and they were always too large, so this time I sized down (got a small) and it fit PERFECTLY.  The fabric is crepey but the lace appeared to be good quality such that it won't rip.  The shirt flows beautifully, so that if you have a tummy, it hides it.  The length of the sleeves and the shirt both worked perfectly.  I would advise that if you are a small woman (smaller than me), you will want to pick a different brand because they do run quite large.",

The simi see-thru offers both style and slight touch of naughty that is both tasteful, as it is fashionable.

If you are traveling on a causal day or perhaps a night out with friends, this top is a real head turner and sure to please.
