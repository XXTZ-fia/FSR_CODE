Luke J. Irwin,"Perfect, great fit",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BVMB9DTYV81Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXS3KKB,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 9, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"This vest is a slim fit. I've seen reviews telling you to get a size bigger, don't unless you're a  big guy. Just understand that slim fit is exactly that. I wanted a tailored, well fitted vest and that's just what this is. Regarding the fabric, it's nice, a good weight to it, and the craftsmanship is good.  The styling is also very good and works as casual or formal. I have another black vest that feels kind of fragile compared to this. This feels good to wear. At this price you would be had pressed to find a better deal. This is my new ""Go to"" vest, I'm very happy with it.",2

Sunny Days,Great vest but only goes up to XL,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MHV540BHOV4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXS3KKB,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 29, 2019",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"We purchased this vest for my sons wedding.  He is 6'2"" and broad shouldered and a big boy.  We bought this vest and it is an exceptional quality vest at a great price.  I only gave it a 4 star because it is a little short in the front and they only go up to size XL..  With the population of larger people I wish they offered it in larger sizes.  I ended up ordering a different vest  made for bigger men but I really did like this one the best.  It's such a great looking vest I actually kept it so my husband could use it.  This vest was too small for my son but it is a sharp looking vest and with exceptional quality material..  My husband is 5'11"" and 215 lb and this vest fits him perfectly.  The only reason for the 4 star rating is because I wish they made it in larger sizes...",4

Because I have a fairly feminine body shape I had to pin it in the back for videos/photos so it looked right on me (it was a little wide in places) but that’s not the fault of the vest.  I will say one of the straps in the back that are used to fit it/tighten it easily tore right out of its seam. I can sew though and just pinned it temporarily for these photos so it isn't a problem for me personally.,

I purchased it to keep in a box labeled ""Final [my] Funeral Clothes."" I hope whoever finds me/goes through my stuff will ensure I'm dressed in this vest when my pine box is lowered into my grave at the historic Oak Grove Cemetery in Nacogdoches, TX.  I intentionally selected/bought/was given, Plot #13 in the new addition of that cemetery.  Hope I make it there in original form and don't otherwise get burned up in some incinerator/dumped into the trash.The fabric is folded in the package and requires a couple of handheld steams to get it flattened out.  I'd buy another one, if I needed one - but not required (an early EOL).  The vendor provided fast/friendly support messages and I encountered no problems with the sale/swap out.  5-stars!

On both of the lower pockets, I opened the bottom seam you'll see when you first look at the pocket opening  (When you hold back the flaps of the pocket, you'll see two seams that run along the length of the opening.  I don't know what happens if you open the top seam...).As to size, I usually take a men's medium (USA), but don't like tight fitting clothes (i.e., slim fit),  so I ordered a large, instead.  Adjusting the back belt helps pull it in a little, but was still a little loose, yet.  After I take it in a little at the bottom of each arm hole, it'll probably fit about halfway between medium and large. So I think the size is about right.overall, I like it.",3
