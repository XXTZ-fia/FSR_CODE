I love that it has a collar and the buttons are real, so you can adjust, as needed. There is a slip under the dress, so you don't have to worry about showing anything you don't want to. The skirt features beautiful pleating that hangs perfectly. I'm 5ft and about 120 lbs. I generally wear a size S, that's what I ordered and it fits great. The sleeves, I do have to roll up but that's to be expected with nearly everything I buy and is an easy fix. There is a button closure at the wrist, which helps. I ordered in Navy Blue and it is exactly as shown, a true Navy color. I love that this comes with a cute belt that you can take off. I've worn that belt with this dress, as well as other pants/outfits. I'd say this dress is a great deal and high quality, too! It has held up through many washes. I've opted to put this in a garment bag when I wash it and have hung to dry. That's worked perfectly! Would highly recommend this dress to anyone.",
