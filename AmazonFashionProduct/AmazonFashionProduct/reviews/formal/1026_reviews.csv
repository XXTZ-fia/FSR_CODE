This shirt is so sheer and thin it's practically see through. You can see every bit of the undershirt. We don't have time to return this time and since he will be wearing a sweater over this shirt it will do. Upside is that it's so thin he shouldn't overheat wearing the sweater over it.

(LIKE 35-45% STRETCH, While the other brand is only 5-10% Max). Another thing to know is that this shirt is not going to shrink in the wash much at all. Maybe hot water, and max drying (or repeat) will force it to shrink some. It is very wrinkle resistant, and looks good, but to look like the ads pics - you are gonna have to really stack some plate to get that kind of fit, and buy a smaller size than normal. My guess is that the model has possibly 2 sizes smaller and a good pump.  But as stated - THIS is the one to buy for the fit advertised. NOT that other one that has very little stretch.",

RU,These Are Dumpster Fire. Stop Making Coofandy Happen.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCOPMSC8JHH9F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXV6G1C,"1.0 "," the United States "," November 10, 2024",Color: Navy BlueSize: Medium,,"Let's start with the basics:  The fabric and material is attempting to hit some of the more premium brands that you'd be paying in excess of $100 to drape over your muscular form. (This is a muscle-fit shirt, so this is a reasonable assumption.)  That's fine, except the packaging is extremely flat which means that in many cases, including my case, the shirt shows up with a deep crease in the collar that is weaker than my lactose intolerant stomach after putting the damage on a pint of Ben & Jerry's. No amount of steaming will fully remove said crease, and the collar itself will likely look ""okay"" as long as it's by itself.  Want to put it under a light sweater? Be prepared to show how not-as-awesome that this shirt is when trying to layer it. Put it under a sports coat? Unless it's the same trash-fast-fashion as the shirt, you're not going to fool anyone and you're going to look out-classed in public.  Finally, muscle sleeves? No, not hardly. I'm a Medium at 5'9, 155 and this thing bloused more than Theo Huxtable's knockoff Gartrelle shirt. (Google it; worth the laugh)  Not only is this not a muscle shirt, Thor, it's also got 2 different-sized sleeve openings at the wrist, which is hilarious. Sure, maybe that was mine, however, quality control on this stuff is through the basement.  Not a good shirt. Not at any price point. Instead of getting 3 of these, slow-roll yourself into something of higher quality. You'll be grateful in the long run.",
