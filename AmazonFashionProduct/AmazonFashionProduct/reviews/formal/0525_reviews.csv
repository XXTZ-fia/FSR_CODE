Jane,Cute top you can dress up or down,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R60CY4U47IX9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9LLCWYV,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 19, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Dark Cyan,,"I like this blouse. It is dressy enough to wear with dress pants for work or going out. It can also be paired with jeans for a more casual look. I ordered the top in Dark Cyan and the color is lovely and exactly as pictured in the product description.  I am 5'3"" tall and weigh 125 lbs. My measurements were between a small and a medium according to the size chart. I ordered the small as the last few tops I ordered were a little big. The small fit me perfectly.  The fabric is nice, polyester with a little stretch to it. It is lightly textured, and I think it would pack well in a suitcase and not be too wrinkled. The stitching is even and secure. The seams should not unravel or pull apart. There is a gold metal clasp at the neckline which I think adds a touch of elegance and flair. The clasp does open and close, but I was able to pull the blouse over my head without undoing it. The V neck/ keyhole and the pleats around the neckline also give the blouse more dimension and interest as do the ruffled elastic cuffs.  I washed this blouse in cold water on the gentle cycle. I then hung it up to dry. It washed very well, and I did not have to iron it (a bonus for me)!  I would recommend this blouse.",3

The teal color is gorgeous and I love the gold accent on the neck - it's a little bit of bling but not too much. The billowy sleeves add a nice balance to the rest of the shirt and the fabric is light and comfortable. It's also easy to care for - I washed it and air dried and it hardly had any wrinkles.

You should just be aware that it’s meant for warmer weather I would say or for work if your office (or you) runs hot.  It’s a gauze / crepe type of thin fabric so it’s not appropriate for cold winter months or locations.  I thought it was more of a warm knit so I was surprised.  That’s why I wanted to remark about it.  It’s still a lovely top for spring or early fall or for those who live in warmer areas.  It’s a flattering fit while still being relaxed.  It will look good with black or white pants or even jeans.  It is comfortable and well made.  I recommend it for spring or early fall type of weather.,

This shirt serves both purposes. The shirt itself has a natural flow to it. It is not tight and it is also not too loose or too big. I ordered a medium and it fits nicely. I could have ordered a small and it would have fit as well (based on the medium) - it would not have been as flowy though.  The material is soft with a slight texture to it. The sleeves have an elastic band near the wrist with a feminine ruffle. The shirt is a perfect corporate work shirt or a shirt to wear for a nice dinner. It is subtle, feminine and professional.",

She got the XL size which she normally wears and it seems to fit pretty well, so true to size.  Sleeve and body length fit was good.  Stitching seemed to be neatly finished.  The Dark Cyan color is rich and bold, very nice.

The dark cyan color is beautiful and goes well with the beauty of this blouse. It is made of a soft fabric, and it is lightweight and comfortable.  The material is 95% polyester and 5% spandex. This blouse can be worn for any occasion.  It comes vacuum-packed, and you will find many wrinkles.  I do not see why it is necessary to vacuum-pack blouses.  Placing in a plastic bag would take the same size shipping container. After washing the blouse in cold water, you will need the iron to remove the wrinkles for the first time.  I am not fond of blouses being shipped vacuumed packed, but that is my opinion.  It still earned five stars.",

The metal piece in the collar elevates the look of the blouse without the necessity of a necklace; I don't wear much jewelry so I appreciate that little touch. The shoulders are slightly pouffy but I think with heat would relax more (as you can see I literally took it out of the package and didn't fuss with it).
