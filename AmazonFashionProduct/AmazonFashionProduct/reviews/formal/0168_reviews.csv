For this price it made so much more sense to just buy one. Came with everything he needed to complete the look (minus the white dress shirt and shoes) He was happy with the way it all fit! This was a size small and for reference he is 5’19” and 135lbs.,
MaineReader,A+ Prom Tuxedo!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IV7SWTA3JYHU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09QKZCP65,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 11, 2024",Size: X-SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I'm leaving a review because the other parents who kindly left reviews in the past helped me so much when we were in what can only be called a ""prom panic"" about getting a tux when all the rentals nearby us were gone, the cheapest mail-order rental was going to be at least $200 and likely closer to $300, and prom was just one week away. My son is 6 feet tall and weighs about 150, so on the tall and slim side, though he spends a lot of time working out--broadish shoulders as a result I'd say. We took a deep breath and, at the advice of other reviewers, followed the size chart and ordered an XS. He hasn't worn an XS anything since 7th grade. He's a senior in high school! But the tux fit PERFECTLY. The only thing we needed to do (because I am not especially expert with an iron and I don't know how to hem pants) is take it to our local dry cleaners for a quick professional press and a hem. They did that in less than one day and tux look AMAZING. It looked like it cost way more than $90! Honestly, I couldn't believe it. I think if you are handy with a steamer or iron (my mother in law is a genius with these things, but she's 4 hours away) you could press it yourself. My son was thrilled with his look. We ordered a black cumberbund and we had a tuxedo shirt at home already. I highly, highly recommend this option if you find yourself in a similar prom panic.",4

This is ideal for your proms or high-school dances, weddings or even professional settings where suits are required. I don't always leave a review, but I had to circle back and leave one, because both suits purchased were perfect. When you get them, unpackage them and hang them up so the lines/wrinkles from being packed have time to smooth out. These are honestly worth more than what they cost in my opinion.",2
