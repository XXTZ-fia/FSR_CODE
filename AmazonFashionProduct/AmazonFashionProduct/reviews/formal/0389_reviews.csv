I received a lot of compliments. It is a very classy looking dress. The back is a little stretchy and loose so I felt that I had to keep pulling the back of my dress up but otherwise it fit very well super comfortable and forgiving. My husband wanted me to buy the same dress in other colors because he loved it so much. I will say that I had two size up because of the top. If you are larger, tested on top you will need to size up. It is not made for larger breasts. I am a DD-DDD on top and although I would typically wear a medium , the large was a much better fit. Very comfortable.",

I would actually say I have a little extra room in it that I wasn’t expecting, but I think a large would be too short. I do wish the dress was a bit longer but I am tall and prefer my dress to almost touch the floor, so not everyone may have the same opinion. The slit is a little more towards the center rather than just on the leg but I kinda like it. And, I got this on deal for $30-32 which is a STEAL.

It holds you in (I wore spanx) without feeling tight because it has spandex (about 5%) which allows the extra stretch.  It’s very comfortable .  Although it’s polyester it’s NOT very hot wearing it especially if you’re in doors with AC, which the venue where I wore this dress had AC.  The length for my height was perfect - I wore about a 4” heel which made it even sexier since with my height.  The quality is great, not see-through, smelled new, I didn’t have a problem with the invisible zipper (was able to pull over my head with no problem) and the black color is amazing!!  Just $40 you can’t go wrong with purchasing this sexy dress and by the way, I received so-o many compliments at the hotel I was stay and also at the event I attended.I usually don’t write reviews - it does help.

Well I found it in this dress. I bought it in 2 colors (teal and wine) in an XS which does fit me great. I came back and bought both again in a small for just in case I gain some between now and then. It's not a sizing issue or fit problem- it's just that this is THE dress and I want to make sure I can where it regardless of my weight. It's stretchy enough but I go up and down to extremes sometimes. Very comfortable dress too. I don't think it would be too hot for warmer weather either. I may have my seamstress put a lining in the skirt part just to hide the seams. But I really do love it and it's my favorite out of all the other dresses I've bought off here. Higher quality too than the others. Personally I feel the price is fair for the quality. Fyi- if you are looking at buying the teal color, it's a little darker than in the pictures.... more like a deeper peacock teal blue. But the wine color is on point and accurate. I'm excited to wear this dress!",8

The large was definitely too tight then, but the royal blue was beautiful. I got sick and was unable to go to the event earlier this year, so I returned the blue and gave black a shot for a different event I have coming up. Nope. I look like I'll be singing in the choir at a funeral. The material is 1970s polyester feeling (doesn't actually bother me) and the fit was not flattering for me.
