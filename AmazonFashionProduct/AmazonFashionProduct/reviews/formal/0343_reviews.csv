It was for a concert I gave outdoors, and it just felt amazing!  It was comfy, it fit very well, it wasn't itchy, and it held its shape.  Too, it washed like a dream (I washed it, cold-cycle, in a King-sized pillow case, then hung it on a hanger, not putting it in the dryer at all), and I literally can NOT find a single flaw in this beautiful top.  If you want to feel good about yourself, and at nearly 70, that has become increasingly rare, this is the top to purchase!  I was SO impressed with the quality of the stitching, that none of the sequins were ""wonky"" or that caught on anything...it was a dream.  Excellent product!  Thanks so much!",6
