Jason W. Bishop,Stylish Elegance Redefined: Perfect Suit for Any Occasion!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11SNB4W3B9FPH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP6KKVFP,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 5, 2024",Color: NavySize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"I recently purchased the Lynerun Men's Suit, and I couldn't be happier with my choice! The solid two-button design provides a timeless look that's perfect for weddings, formal events, and business meetings. The slim fit silhouette enhances my physique, making me feel confident and stylish.  The 3-piece set, which includes a blazer, vest, and pants, is impeccably tailored, and the quality of the fabric is outstanding—soft to the touch yet durable enough for regular wear. I received numerous compliments throughout the event, and I felt like the best-dressed man in the room!  The fit is true to size, allowing for comfortable movement without sacrificing style. Whether you're standing, sitting, or dancing, this suit remains impressive. Overall, I highly recommend the Lynerun Men's Suit for anyone looking to make a lasting impression. It’s an excellent investment for any wardrobe!",

My Opinion,Fit check 3x,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDUJ2Q5M2445Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP6KKVFP,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 21, 2024",Color: BlackSize: 3X-Large,Verified Purchase,"We did a fit check to see if he could wear it. It was very comfortable. This was perfect and for the price this was shockingly good and a great addition to his suits. My husband has a tummy and the vest somehow complimented the entirety of the suit and his body build. I would definitely purchase again. He had a total of two wears from this particular suit. Anytime you can get a suit that feels, good, looks great, and compliments the body of an adult male in a 3x for under a $100 is a win in my book. Either way he has already gotten his money’s worth. It cost you over $200 to just rent a tux so in my eyes it was worth it. I don’t know how it will fit anyone else but in my opinion it was well worth it.",2

Not great quality… one of the bags ripped and zipper pulled right off. And no we were not over stuffing it.

We ordered this so my son could have a nice suit for job interviews. Well like a lot of college kids he waited till the last minute to open to ask mommy to iron it and to our surprise it had spots all down the side of a sleeve. He ended up just wearing a shirt and tie but it was still frustrating!! I better not get charged for returning a suit that was damaged when I got it! When clicking return reason I selected damaged but… it didn’t allow me to write an explanation. Nice suit… but open immediately so your not left with nothing in case there is an issue.,

We wanted a more modern color than his dark suit. We were definitely impressed with this suit. The material is fantastic, it almost fit perfectly right off the rack, it is very sharp looking, and definitely what we were looking for. My husband is 6’3” and about 225 pounds we were told to order the. 3XL according to all of the size charts. This suit fit the best and looks the nicest. Way better than I had anticipated we had to have the pants hemmed and taken in in the tush because my husband have a booty and we had the suit jacket sleeves shortened a touch, the vest fit perfectly, but was on the snug side so we didn’t do anything with that and hubby says once he loses 10 pounds it’ll fit perfectly ! So roughly $70 needed $80 in alterations, but still a lot cheaper than a two-piece custom suit at $900!! I will add pictures once it’s back from alterations, and my husband wears it to the wedding so we get a feel of how it holds up.",
