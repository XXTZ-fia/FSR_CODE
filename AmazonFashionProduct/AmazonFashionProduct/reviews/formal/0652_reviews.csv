The fabric on the skirt is cut & hemmed uneven so one side of the skirt is noticeably shorter. The bodice isn't as long as shown on the model, very short.  Everything else is fine.",

PS1988,"Not flattering, see-through material",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWNCOYKXPA57U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF6WV7S3,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 23, 2024",Color: FloralblackSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,The shape is not flattering and the fabric is see-through.

Amazon Customer,Not for large snuggle pups,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R352O7ORHR8GEL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF6WV7S3,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 4, 2024",Color: FloralbegieSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I was really excited to receive this dress and really wanted it to work. I bought a large because I wear a bra size of 32 F-G (32 DD before pregnancy) with a 28-inch waist. I'm 5'6 and weigh 130 lbs.  This was not flattering on me at all, even with a minimizing nursing bra. The shoulders fit fine but the black portion of the dress is way too short for my large chest.  It ties directly below my chest, not my waist. Feel like a trash bag with big boobs. Returning asap.",4
Mouse45,Comfortable and flattering,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35ALJK1AZ9P0K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF6WV7S3,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 23, 2024",Color: FloralblackSize: Small,,This dress is so cute and comfortable. The shirt portion of the dress is elastic where is connects to the skirt so you can easily lift it up to nurse but it is secure enough to prevent any fashion accidents. The tie is attached to the dress and it has pockets which are a huge bonus. Overall this is my new favorite dress. I just wish it came in more colors.,2
