Maybe it is partially my fault because I prefer the fit to be closer to the body and expect more from an ""athletic fit."" It just seems too loose fitting.

My husband can wear an XL in some things but usually wears a XXL. I mistakenly ordered an XL, and it fits perfectly except the sleeves are too long, which is surprising considering he has long arms and the shirt was smaller than we wanted. I would suggest ordering a size smaller if you are between sizes or would really like to show off those muscles. The description and pictures make it very clear that this shirt is made to compliment the muscular, athletic man. Honestly, I did not think this shirt, even the XXL, was going to work because as handsome as my husband is, he no longer has his athletic six-pack. It is more like a 12 or 14-pack. I ordered the shirt anyway because he liked it. To my surprise, this XL shirt looks amazing on him! It shows off his shoulders and shoulder blades while skimming over his midsection giving him a leaner more athletic build. In other words, it seems to show off what it needs to show off and hide what it needs to hide. Perhaps the dark color helps.....?? My husband loves the material and how it feels.

As you can see in the images, though, it is indeed functional as a dress shirt. Because it's a bit on the heavy side, though, I'm afraid to wear it in warm weather, as I would probably sweat my buns off. Or, more likely, sweat my shoulderblades off.  My wife's take on it was slightly negative, in that she said it looks like it's made from 1970s material (the style of the material, that is, not that the material itself is 60 years old). My response to that was that was a good thing — the '70s were great! I'm prejudiced, though, having been born in 1958.  Bottom line: I like this shirt; I don't care about styles (whether I'm ""in style"" or ""out of style""). I often wonder why people frantically watch each other to see what's ""cool"" or ""hip"" and want to dress like everyone else. Let everyone create their own flow, I always say.

You never know what you are going to receive when it comes to fit or quality.  I was pleasantly surprised with this shirt.  I normally wear between an XL or a L according to the fit or cut.  Since this was advertised as athletic fit, I expected that it would be on the tighter side, and I ordered the XL.  At 210 lbs. and 5'11"", with an athletic build, this XL was not tight at all.  It is not too big, but it is not form fitting either except for the arms. I probably could have gotten away with a Large and it would have been perfect because the material has some stretch to it, so that the sleeves shape around your arms when they are bent but it is not restricting on your biceps which can be uncomfortable with non-stretching material in some shirts.  I think the hem length is just a tad longer than I prefer for a shirt meant to be worn untucked, but it is not drastically long where it won't work in that way.  The collar lays nicely on this shirt and the buttons are all sewn on correctly.  Overall, the material is heavier than anticipated which makes it drape nicely as well.  Hope that helps you today.",
