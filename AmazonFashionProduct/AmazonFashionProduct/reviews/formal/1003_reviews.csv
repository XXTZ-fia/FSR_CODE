I can’t say for sure if I love or hate them.  I think it’s more love to hate them!Let’s start with the material.  It’s a very thin, stretchy, slightly sheen, very nylon-type of material.  They are not the same type of material as yoga tights.  They fit snugly from waist to hip, then fall straight down.  I really like the seams in the front and back.  They really add character to these pants.  They are super comfortable, and they fit so snugly that it looks like they give my hips a little lift.  However, because the material is skin-tight, it will show panty lines or anything that’s uneven.The back looks okay, but that skin-tight fitting also applies to the front, and that’s not too flattering.  That’s my problem.  I love that they’re comfortable, but it’s like wearing regular pantyhose that shows everything.  I would still wear these pants, but probably with an oversized top that covers the front.  I wonder if it would have been better if I had ordered a size bigger.For reference, I am 5’7” and 130 lbs.  These pants fit me skin-tight from waist to hips, but because they’re stretchy, they’re comfortable, just very revealing.",3
