I've never bought clothing through Amazon so i was specktical at first. When it arrived it was so much more than what I expected! O bought the set with the light blue top and stars suspenders and the top is to soft! I bought size 12-18m my baby is on 12m size, the outfit seems like it will fit perfectly or maybe just a tad big for his first birthday next month but it's okay. The hat I'm not a fan of for one when i put it on the front flap folds back... And two my son hates putting on hats so it might me a no go on the hat that came with this set but seriously it is great material!! Wish i could afford to buy all of them 😭",

Material is kinda thin for the price but babies outgrow clothes fast and I know he'll be handsome while he sports it 😁,

The little shirt onesie has plastic snaps that hold secure, and the detachable bow tie has them, too. The little suspenders hook onto the buttons on the waist of the pants. The fabric comes a little wrinkly, but a steamer will easily get that out, for the perfect photograph, for instance. :) The onesie is comfortable on the skin, not scratchy. I recommend this little outfit; it would be the hit of a baby shower, for sure! :)",
