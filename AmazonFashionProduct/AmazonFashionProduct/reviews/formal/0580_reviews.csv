The color is vibrant, it's not too sheer. The cut is great. The fabric is soft, softer than how it looks. I thought the fabric was going to feel stiff, but it doesn't. The fabric, I would say average, not great but not bad. No pockets, which I like, makes it looks more sleek. I do see a few threads that I'll need to cut, so let's hope that's not an issue. It did wash well.  I wouldn't call this shirt wrinkle free, maybe wrinkle resistant. It does wrinkle slightly and you would need an iron to make it look sharp.  I think I'm happiest with the cut.

It wasn't easily fixed with ironing.  The sleeves were too short for my husband's liking, but he does have longer arms than most. The cuffs fit comfortably for him, though, even when buttoned on the 2nd button (inner button).  The fabric is a little stiff, even after ironing. I washed the shirt on cold and tumble dried. It came out wrinkled, and it wasn't super easy to iron the wrinkles out.  I feel like I only gave negative points about this shirt, but it's really not that bad, especially for the price.
