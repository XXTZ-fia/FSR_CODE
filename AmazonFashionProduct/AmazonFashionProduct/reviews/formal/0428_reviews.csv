It's a tiny suit, after all... buying it in the premise of really only being able to use it once before your child outgrows it puts the price and quality in perspective.  The material is pretty rough (con) and thin (pro-- I'd rather it be somewhat thin material given the fact that it's a suit for a child meant to be worn at a party where it will presumably be hot and they'll be running around the whole time).  The bow tie was cute (it has a small elastic loop that goes around the top button) although it is admittedly somewhat poorly sewn (you'd only notice as the parent who has seen it up close -- barely off center, raw edges on the middle piece of fabric of the tie which seem to want to fall apart when you're getting the tie on and off the button).  The pants were long and our almost 2 year old's height is in the 97th percentile (over 36"" tall, average torso / leg length), but they still fit well otherwise.
