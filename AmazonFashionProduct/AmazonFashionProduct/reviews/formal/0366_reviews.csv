It’s a little see through, but what white top isn’t at lease a little. I love this to add to my work wardrobe and even dress it down. definitely recommend!",9

It arrived with some damage to the material on the upper right shoulder, and when I tried it on I found it to be rather shapeless. It would really benefit from some darts at the bust and being taken in at the waist. Without darts, the armholes form rather unattractive gaps that would give anyone standing next to you a great view of your bra. If you're planning to wear it under a cardigan or a blazer these fit issues are less problematic, but I'd still rather have something that fit better to begin with. There were also a number of long threads hanging off that needed to be trimmed short. The bust, shoulder, and length measurements did all measure true to the size chart.",7

I can confirm that a medium fits more like a generously sized small, which means that it was my size. The fabric is nice, and the green color is really pretty in real life. It washes and wears well.

MelissaCJohnson,Chic & versatile- elegant tank for office or home,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTEZKSDCO59JA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CS6ZSQMD,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 23, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Light Pink,,"I ordered this tank in light pink, which seems more like a dusty rose. It's 100% polyester, sleeveless, and is made with high quality. The pleats at the front elevate it from a simple top to one of class and sophistication. I chose a medium size, and it fits comfortably, it's a relaxed silhouette that drapes well without clinging to the body. After wearing it all day at work, I can definitely attest to its comfort and lightness. The care instructions suggest a gentle wash in cold water and laying it flat to dry. However, I prefer to dry clean items I'm especially fond of, like this shirt, to maintain their condition over time. This has the added benefit of preserving the pleats and overall shape of the top. Versatility- best feature- it both complements my office wear by adding a professional touch to my ensemble and easily transitions into casual wear by pairing it with a comfy pair of jeans. This top is a relaxed, chic, and versatile choice that easily adapts to both business and leisure without compromising on elegance.",18

This top is AH-MAAAZ-ING. - It's a very good polyester crepe georgette, which drapes beautifully and is not see-through. - The garment is extremely well made for the price: stitches are fairly small (they could be smaller but oh well), collar is properly cut and attached, pleats are well executed. - VERY IMPORTANT: Arm holes are cut high enough to hide underarm flab! Yay! - The top fits true to size and is, more importantly, true to vendor's size chart. (It's crucial to take your measurements and use those for sizing clothing online. Ain't no other way to get it right, girlies!) - I give it a 10 point deduction (but do understand) for not having darts at the bust, which would have ensured a truly perfect fit. But darts are expensive, so oh well again. - The white is beautiful and perfect for wearing under suit jackets and blazers at work. This is one you want in every color. I'm so impressed I actually followed the vendor to see what else they make that's cute!",3
