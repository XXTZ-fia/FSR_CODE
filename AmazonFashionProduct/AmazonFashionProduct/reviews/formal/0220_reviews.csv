I then still had to iron it by using two irons, one for steaming it & the other for pressing it.  Could all have been avoided if it had been packed loosely in a box instead of a vacuum sucking plastic bag. But my effort was worth it!  I love the dress💞",9

I had tried on over a dozen dresses, but I kept this one because I liked the way the sleeves covered my mature upper arms, and the cut of the bodice was the least unflattering to my physique. However, after only wearing it for about 12 hours, when I took it off I found there were many snags in the fabric, on the front and the back. Fortunately, I was able to use a small hook and pull most of them through to the inside so I should be able to wear it again. But if the snags had been worse and developed a hole, it would’ve been a one time wearing. If you’re gonna be partying hard or in a large crowd where you might have more objects to be rubbing up against, this may not be the dress for you.  Otherwise, I loved the dress. This was size 18 in the periwinkle blue (called blue gray. The lighting from my photos isn’t so good to capture the proper color.)",9
