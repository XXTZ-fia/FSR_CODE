Dr. Vee,Beware of missing items - give yourself time to order from this seller....,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IQ511Z6L7Q5T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTD3T6BC,"2.0 "," the United States "," June 12, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Very nice outfit. Too bad the 4 piece suit only came with 3 items (shirt, vest, pants - missing the bowtie). It was evident that this suit was a prior return as the top two buttons were not fastened - they never checked for proper return of all 4 pieces. We paid for a 4 piece suit. We loved it due to the color and particularly the cute little bow tie which accentuated the look. Of course everything came in the package EXCEPT for the cute little bow tie. What is further upsetting is the fact that I have no way to contact the ""seller"" to ask for the bowtie. Only option given by Amazon is to make a return or exchange. Now, 3 days before a special family event, I have to embark on a search for a bowtie to match a yellow & blue outfit. Two stars for what was sent anyways....",

(I have to fold up the hems to shorten the pants a bit but it still looks elegant that way.) - 4-piece-suit looks handsome and I didn’t need to purchase anything extra to a complete the outfit. - Loving the tie! It’s actually a fake tie, which irritated me at first. But then I realized how genius this is as little kids shouldn’t have anything tied around their necks, so it’s a „safety tie“. It’s very easy to snap on and if you snap it on correctly with the shirt completely buttoned up you can’t tell the tie is snapped on. (The shirt is not completely buttoned up in my picture.)  Cons: - The shirt is a mix of cotton and polyester and it’s a bit thin. Not thin to the point that it’s see through but if you are in a cooler climate/season you may want your little one to wear a shirt underneath. - The pockets on the vest are not real pockets, just decoration.  All in all a great purchase! I’m very happy with the outfit and give it 5 stars as it’s perfect for my child.",9
