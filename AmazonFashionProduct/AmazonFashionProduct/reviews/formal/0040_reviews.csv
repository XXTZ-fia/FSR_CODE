Ashley,Good quality and comfortable onesie,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RLVJRJVOWFBP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CY53KMXB,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Color: GreenSize: 6-12 Months,Verified Purchase,"The outfit was very cute on my 8 month old that is 21.5 lbs, a little over 2 ft long.  The bow tie was a little long on the straps but the neck circumference was perfect.  Any smaller of a circumference and it would have been too tight around his neck to button the top button.  There would also not be any more room lengthwise in the onesie.  The pants were a little long but not to the point of looking funny.  He just isn’t a fan of hats these days & his head is in the high 70th percentile so he didn’t end up wearing the hat.  But it looked very dapper for the second he let us keep it on.  We ordered this outfit to go with our earthy tones family picture.",

My baby was born a month early and was a preemie, and he is 11 months old now with 10 month old size. I ordered 12-18 months, and the top is already getting tight. The pants are not stretchy so I think he won’t be able to wear it for a long time.",
