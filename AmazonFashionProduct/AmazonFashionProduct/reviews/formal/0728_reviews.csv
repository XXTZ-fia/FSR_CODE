And it was still too small! We needed it for our 37 anniversary which was a white party. We had to find something else short notice for the event. We will not buy anything from them again.,5
Marshall Troublefield,LOVE THIS!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHS3T01TQCZBQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09V782HW2,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 20, 2022",Size: X-LargeColor: Purple,Verified Purchase,"I was worried about this one but I am absolutely in love with it. I ordered an XXL because I wasn't sure and figured I could just take it to my tailor and get alterations on it. I figured better bigger than order it and it be small. The dealer contacted me with a message and asked my size and I told them and they sent me a XL. It fits but since we are in a modern world of clothes being FITTED, I took it to my seamstress to have it worked on. Soon as she is done I will upload a pic. I will def order a few more of these. The fact that the dealer reached out and contacted me was TOP NOTCH CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!",5
