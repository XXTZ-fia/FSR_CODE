It is stretchy and very comfortable to the skin. I am 6ft, 180lbs and normally wear a medium in a polyester type shirt. The large fits me well and I think the medium would be too small for me. I do like the chest pocket as it looks different from the other button up shirts that I have without any type of pocket. I will get other coofandy shirt in the future.",

His shoulder is at 21 inches, so I didn't want him to have the droopy shoulders if I went up. I am glad I ordered this way. The shirt fit him perfectly. He said he wished it was a little longer because even at 5ft 7 inches, moving his arms caused the shirt to rise almost to his naval. He also said that the buttons felt smaller than normal.

Does not need any touchup to look ready to wear the next day. It is well made with no loose threads and the button holes are all of easy to use size. Best of all, it is comfortable to wear, smooth on the skin and feels good even on hot evenings outdoors. At this price point it is a very good deal.",
