Ms. Mikki,Perfect,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R313SR7AIDDXHQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGL97VWP,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 24, 2024",Size: 18Color: Midnight,Verified Purchase,"So I wore this dress to an evening wedding this weekend and it was perfect. Super comfortable,  loved the navy, and the low but modest neckline with the satin lapels give sexy elegance. The sleeves are long with ruching at the cuffs (would have been great with satin cuffs). Lastly the jersey is a really good quality.  The dress was crumpled at the bottom of the garment bag in my trunk for several hours, but there were no wrinkles.  I wore it with Susanny Rhinstone Kitten Heels, and a reemonde rhinestone shawl (50 degrees - brrr). I was cute, warm and sparkly.",11
