A well-fitting, ivory, satin or silk blouse is one of them. This is a wonderfully versatile example. Fits well, has a flattering cut along the sides, and an interest point at the neck. Personally, I like things to stay put and not have to fuss with them, so I put a couple of tiny stitches, on the inside of the top detail, to hold everything in place. But that’s me! Not really needed….  Could look good with skinny jeans, pumps, hoop earrings and a clutch. Or, it could be the separates version of a LBD! Ivory blouse, black pencil skirt, black pumps, gold or silver clutch and maybe a pair of CZ studs! Or, pearl studs! So many ways to dress this blouse up or down. Comes in wonderful colors.
