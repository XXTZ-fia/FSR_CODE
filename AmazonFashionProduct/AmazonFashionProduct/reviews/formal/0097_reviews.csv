Decided to take a chance on this dress due to reviews and I'm so glad that I did!  The event was held at a VERY hoity-toity restaurant in Scottsdale with a dress code so I needed elegance, sophistication...and judging by the number of female patrons that came up to me during the evening telling me how much they loved my dress, it succeeded.  The dress itself is very simple, no buttons, no zippers...a medium heavy sweater dress that forms and drapes in all the right places.  I still have some tummy bulge but my husband said he didn't notice it (we're our own worse critics).  You'll need an extra set of hands just to smooth down the collar in the back when you first put it on.  Stats - 61 y.o., 5'10"", 167# wearing a size Large.  Dress is long enough to be paired with tall boots and looked great.  I nearly wore a wide black belt with it but decided in the end to keep it simple and let the dress speak for itself.",12
