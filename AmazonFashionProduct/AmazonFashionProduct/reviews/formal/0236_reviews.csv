It was perfect in looks and cut. However, only a few hours of him wearing it passed, and one side of the cinch strap on the back unraveled and came detached from the vest. This resulted in tearing of the other side, since both straps were hanging from a single side, connected by the buckle. The look of the vest is good; the quality of its construction leaves something to be desired.",
