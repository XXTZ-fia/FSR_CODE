The jumpsuit itself was very roomy and stretchy as advertised, however, the material was a bit scratchy and thin. It fit her well on her thighs and legs, but it clings to the upper part of your body. She's overweight and doesn't like that the material accentuates her insecurities. The listing says it's loose and wide-legged, which it is, but doesn't mention the kind of material it's made from. If she would've known, she wouldn't have purchased it. Unfortunately, it's going back.",
