It came folded and sealed in a plastic bag. Upon opening it, I was first impressed with the feel of the material. It's soft and substantial. That's a worry in the day of nothing but man made fibers. This was a blend of wool and of course, polyester. But the blend was sufficient that it felt and smelled like wool.  The coat was wrinkled fairly significantly right out of the bag. I did an initial try on to ensure that I wanted to keep it and the fit was on point. After that, I took a warm iron to it and the wrinkles were soon a memory.  I got the black herringbone pattern. I'm happy with the color, black, and the overall cut of the jacket. It was fit in all of the right places, shoulder and chest, and a bit forgiving in the abdomen. Which is good, there's nothing worse than that pull that you often see in mens jackets when buttoned.  I have broad shoulders and about a 45 inch chest, the XL accommodated that. The sleeve and overall jacket length was just perfect, no need for tailoring.  If you're looking for a presentable, good fitting sports coat, then you can't go wrong with this choice. I suspect there'll be another one or two in different colors and patterns in my future.",3

This is my first herringbone blazer. I know these are traditionally made of wool, but of course that'd quadruple the price, instead we got something here with these hybrids that while may not match the durability, definitely looks slightly erm... ""tidier"" when it comes to the fiber fuzz.  The fit was perfect to my size and didn't need any modifications/tailoring, it was slightly tight on the shoulders but somehow i like it that way, it's probably due to being a sport blazer.  The color matches the listing and the inside liner feels very good, people tend to underestimate how the liner plays a role on the overall feeling, if its soft or stays cool or warm, but this one felt fine.  The coat came a little squeezed in the bag instead of carefully folded so it came with significant creasing, it was solved at home with some steam but it is unusual to come so wrinkled, but it may have been the shipping process so i can't blame Paul Jones.  I've worn this with Jeans and a button shirt and a turtleneck sweater and it looks just fantastic.

Even though this coat is an extra large I have noticed that it fits my husband like a glove. His weight fluctuates anywhere between 230 - 250 anti 6 ft 3 so I needed one that was long enough and that would accommodate with weight fluctuation. At either size I noticed this coat fits like a glove! It does has decorative pockets, they're not functional. The bottom of the hem on the back is not open, it is sewn together at the bottom. Wrinkle free even at the back of the closet! The little pocket square is removable. There are buttons on the cuffs which add to the aesthetic of the coat itself.

This suit coat surprised me so much, I bought two more from this company within a few days of getting this one. What a value!  Quality is totally on par with suit coats costing $75 - $150 at a number of the national department stores, depending on sales and supply.  I ordered bigger than I needed being burned over and over again with no-name brands and lack of real size adaptation the North American Male can trust . The size chart here was accurate - and what's better, accurate with both of the additional suit coats I bought from PJ Paul Jones.  This jacket is indeed a wool blend and IS NOT in my opinion an all season jacket. It is thick, and hot. I'll use it plenty this winter.  Negative to buying suit coats this way is the work you need to put in to make them look their best before you wear them. I use a combination of a steamer and then an iron to work out the wrinkles - which are significant and tough to remove. Once they are however, you have a great suit coat at an amazing cost.  If you're expecting super high quality at this price, you're bound to be disappointed.
