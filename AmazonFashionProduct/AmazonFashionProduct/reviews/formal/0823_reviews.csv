The fabric is light enough, the color is soooo great, and I've worn it on a girls night out and also to a bridal shower, dress up or dress it down, super flexible and versatile.  Only drawback as with any romper, the functionality of going to the bathroom, etc. But you know that going into it sooo if that's a problem, don't buy rompers.",
