I had to put on high heels for the picture to make it look less dowdy on me. The waist band was either too high for the waist or too low for empire waist, so maybe this one is good for someone with a long torso, but I’m not sure.

I might have been able to order the medium, but I'd rather it be a bit roomy than tight and honestly it feels like it fits perfectly. The material is slick and shiny so it's not as comfortable as a cotton would be, but that's to be expected since it's mostly polyester with some elastane. The pockets are a welcome addition and they are actually decently deep and usable!  Overall, I really like this dress and think it will look great with a cardigan and some heels. I could see it being used for many different occasions or events where a ""dressy casual"" balance needs to be struck. I think it is worth the $40 being charged and would recommend it to others!",7

The color does not twist out of shape at all like I have experienced on some dresses. The medium is what I would consider a size small so order one size up from your usual. The material is silky but also feels slightly heavy so this would work well in between seasons and winter, though it’s too hot to be a summer dress. Overall very pleased.",

It's true to size, but if you want to have more of a bodycon ultra close fit, you can go down one size, but keep in mind that the fabric will show everything if you do that. Since this fit me close but not at all tight, it all worked out perfectly for my preferences. Now let's get to the really important part: the pockets. They are terrific! Not those silly shallow ones that can't hold your phone. Real pockets. And they don't even mess up the silhouette of the dress. This one is a winner!
