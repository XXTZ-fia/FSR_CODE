JA Bird,Not bad for a $75 suit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R195C3Q58FWN00/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D99WJHT2,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Denim Blue,,"I didn’t expect much from this suit but was pleasantly surprised. The material was better quality than I expected. It wrinkles quite easily so needs to be steamed before wearing each time.  The fit was decent, but not great for movement. While standing, it was great and comfortable, but with bending or stretching, it didn’t stay in place very well. With modern materials being so stretchy, this didn’t have the movement that I’ve come to enjoy.  Still, for the price it is a very good value. I did really like the color. I got several compliments on it. Also like the vest, as many suits don’t come with that anymore. I was happy with the fit overall.",

I ordered black, because it goes with everything I own, lol, and it looks great. I was a little worried about the slim fit thing, cause I'm normally more of an athletic type build, with a small belly which encroach on my body when I was in my 50's. I used the chart provided, and determined I needed a large. I am pleased to say that the suit fits great, and it really slims down my look, which is fantastic. The fabric doesn't have much in the way of stretch, do I am glad it fits just right. I have not tried to wash this yet, so I can't say for sure how well it will wash up, or if it wrinkles after washing it. I have only worn this once so far, to a wedding, but it was nice to have something like this to use. I think this is a great suit for an unbelievably low cost, and I can recommend it to you.",
J Lay,Looks good,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R357DXKG8MZDCQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D99WJHT2,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 23, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Plaid-navy,,"For the price of $75, this suit exceeds my expectations.  It looks good and the cut is nice.  It does seem to run just a tad small.  The vest and jacket are a little more snug than I expected.  The pants on the other hand are really narrow.  The waist fits a little snug, but wearable.  The legs are really narrow though.  If you are a really skinny guy, you'll probably be fine.  But if you have an athletic build, it's tough to fit your legs in these pants and still be able to move.  Which brings me to another point.  There is almost no flex to this suit like most modern suits have.  It feels more like a traditional suit from 10-15 years ago before they started putting flex in everything.But as I said before.  If you are looking for a $75 suit, this one looks very good.  I would just recommend ordering it a size up.  Even in my case, where I will never wear the pants, the vest and jacket alone are worth the price.",

I was worried about the pants not fitting since sometimes it's difficult to purchase pants online without trying them on first. But this stretches so you don't need to worry about the sizing.

At 5'11"" and 180 lbs I got the small and it fit exactly how I wanted it to look. The downside to this is that the zipper broke the first time I tried it on so these pants are actually never going to get used. For this reason I gave it a 4 star review. I'm not going to say they are all poor quality but the fact that mine broke immediately meant I couldn't give it a full 5 stars. However, I will say that for this price I definitely recommend someone to buy this because if it fits then it's a steal. It looks good and it's a good price!",2

Color is great, just as pictured, material is about what i expected, nothing too fancy. The pockets have the white sliver of color stitched in the breast pocket, would have liked the ability to keep or remove it but it’s okay not the end of the world. Truthfully about a 3.7/5 rounded up even though I usually don’t. Get past the wrinkles and it’s a solid 4 star product for a fair price.",

The pants were about 2 inches too long and the vest is on the tight side but the jacket sleeves are perfect the shoulders are good and everything pretty much fits.

It is not too tight though, i will need to put use a belt for this to keep them up, which is fine. The vest is decent as well.  There was some loose strings coming from the right sleeve. But no other issues found. The pockets are sewed in like other suits. Personally I find that stupid but that's normal unfortunately. But isn't hard to undo the sticking to use the pockets.

Although, I would probably go for a Large jacket instead, because the Medium shoulders and arm length aren't quite enough for my build. The pants waist and length are perfect for my height.  The pant cut/shape is also in the middle of a slim fit and regular fit, right about where you want a suit. One thing that I'm not absolutely in love with is the white trim lapel sticking out of the jacket and vest.  Sadly, I don't have a full length mirror to take photos.
