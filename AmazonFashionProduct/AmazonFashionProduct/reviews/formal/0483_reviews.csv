However I did notice a lot of loose thread on the pants. One of the buttons came off because of the loose thread. I do recommend enforcing the buttons on the pants for the suspenders. Overall great outfit.,

Great for fall weather, perfect outfit for any occasion or family gather . awesome for photoshoot ! It fits 2 years old perfect, size is correct. Also, every bottom and every stitch is a high level work. It definitely worth money paid for it. After washing it in washing machine, it didn’t ruin it at all. I highly recommend washing on cool cycle. Definitely a great purchase.",
