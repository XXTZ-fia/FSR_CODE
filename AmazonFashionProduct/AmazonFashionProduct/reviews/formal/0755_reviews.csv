The shoulder pads are noticeable while wearing the jacket. This doesn't bother me, but fashion is subjective. The outfit does seem to fit as described. I would not wear anything thicker than a light blouse under the jacket or it may fit snug. The pants do fit at the waist, but seem looser in the legs - the suit is a nice, complete jacket and pants set. There is a pretty pleat in the front pant legs which I may have to keep up with by ironing on a very, very low setting. I chose the navy blue which is very dark. The company states this suit may be washed or dry cleaned gently and I would only hang it to dry it. Overall, this suit set seems good, but the style might seem to suit a more mature shopper. I may order one in a different color.",

In fact, I expected it to be totally horrible...boy was I wrong! The material of this suit is actually really nice and looks like the same material as some of my dress pants. The pants have a stretchy section in the back but a flat front that will suit any business attire. The jacket fit well to my surprise (36D up top) and buttoned in the middle just fine without looking like I borrowed my grandmas suit. This suit actually surprised me a lot, and I'm so glad I gave it a try. It's a total bargain at this price and I usually pay four times as much for a suit of this kind. Now I just need to decide which color to get next....highly recommend!",2

The jacket fits her well but is longer on her than the model's of its Amazon product photos. She likes it's coverage and its smart-professional fit that can also be worn in more casual social settings like cafe & restaurant dates with her friends. She wears the jacket by itself with black pants. The matching Teal pants with her jacket is too long on her and fits her too loosely. The only part that fits her well is the waist area. Everything below that is too loose for her style preference. Good quality material and sewing. She likes the satiny feel of the inside of the jacket and its more matte look & feel of the outside.  Recommended.,
