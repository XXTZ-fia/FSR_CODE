Bridget McLain,Not worth the price tag,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUG3KH5ZGXSI9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNKWQ6CP,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,,"As a regular button up, I dislike it. The fabric is quite thick and scratchy. Due to the fabric type, it also collects dirt, dust, and hair like a magnet. My cat simply walked by when I was testing out the shirt and when I looked back in the mirror, the shirt was now covered in white cat hair sprinkles.  I do not think this shirt is an appropriate ""premium formal shirt"". at all. Catering a place that requires formal wear, maybe. but not a nice formal dress shirt.  It definitely does remind me of my uniform shirts when I worked at McDonalds. Take that as you wish. If you've worked in fast food at any time of your life, I'm sure you remember how uncomfortable, scratchy, and stiff the uniform shirts were.  The price point is far too high for a shirt that feels and looks like this one. It also gets wrinkled like crazy, and it takes a while of ironing to get it straight.",
Midwestern Dad,Neck is comically oversized,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SFG5C82YRMJ7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNKWQ6CP,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: White,,"This seemed like a decent shirt out of the bag, so I was extremely disappointed to discover the neck on my XL was HUGE. I've worn XL shirts my whole adult life without incident, but this one hangs around my neck like a fall jacket, not a dress shirt.  To make sure I wasn't crazy I held it up to some other collared XLs from different brands (though these were not specifically ""chef"" shirts) and the neck seems to be a full two inches bigger than what's standard. If I lie it down flat and measure from the top button on one side to the corresponding button hole on the other, I get about 21 inches!  This is a fatal flaw and will make the shirt look ridiculous unless you have a huge neck. Maybe I could pull it off with the top button unbuttoned in some settings, but I think I'm just going to consider it a total loss.  Another thing to bear in mind is that the buttons are covered. That's not good or bad, but you might not notice it in the picture.",
Alexander Brownlee,Well designed and fits as expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AWR7B52I8NTB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNKWQ6CP,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: French Blue,,"This dress shirt was designed with working in the kitchen in mind. The buttons are covered to prevent any snagging, and there are two chest pockets. One pocket is sized to fit a cooking thermometer, and the other is larger with enough space to fit a notecard or small pocket notebook.",
Paul Trinh,Great and durable work shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RRYTJ6WKV6KF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNKWQ6CP,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,,I got this shirt for my son who is a waiter.  The shirt is high quality and made very well.  It’s thicker than his other work shirts and feels like it will last much longer after wash and wear and tear versus the other ones.  Food stains are easily removed when washed and the shirt has retained much of its size and shape.  The flap in the front that hides the buttons elevates the look and makes this a must have for anyone in the hospitality industry.,
National Park Traveler,Sturdy black dress shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IRQ831HU4AB3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNKWQ6CP,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,,I ordered this for my teen son who is hard on his clothes. He needed a nice black shirt and I thought this one would hold up well. It has so far. The material is soft and comfortable and it washes well. It's also a good fit and was sized as expected. I would order from this designer again.,
JJH42,solid and well made shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1604YV5ZSLB6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNKWQ6CP,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 3, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: French Blue,,"This is a simple and plain button down shirt that's good for casual to business wear.  I like how the buttons are hidden, though it does require a little more effort to button it up.  The button holes are tight and keep the buttons securely in place.  It was very wrinkled out of the packaging, but smoothed itself over after a wash and hanging.  The french blue is a nice color choice, softer and more washed out than regular or royal blue.I typically wear size Large.  I'm 6'1"" and wear a 42L suit.  I have a 16.5"" neck and 35 inch sleeves.  I own other shirts by Chef Works and knew to order a size up.  Large does fit me, but it's athletically cut and more restrictive.  The XL fits me quite comfortably with extra room in the arms and chest for easier movement.  The cuffs are a little looser so my watches slide under easily.I really do like this shirt.  In fact, I just realized I'm wearing it as I'm writing this review.",

Star Moon,Decent work shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HQ6KH012CEK2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNKWQ6CP,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2023",Size: MediumColor: White,,"My son is 5’10”, 140 lbs, and I got him size medium. The construction of this shirt is sturdy and good quality. It’s a standard fit with plenty to tuck in. My son is a server at a country club, so wears white dress shirts as part of his uniform. He likes this shirt and says it’s thicker than most of his white button downs. The only thing I think could be better is the wrinkle resistance. It wrinkles just like any other shirt. I’ve washed it once so far, and the food splatters washed right out. I always hang dry his work shirts so I can’t comment on if this shrinks in the dryer. It has to be ironed in order to look polished and professional. (I hadn’t ironed it yet in these pics, but I did try to steam it without much success). If you don’t mind ironing, then this is a nice work shirt.",
C.M.P.,Excellent Dress Shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G9Y8T4FQ4NCX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNKWQ6CP,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: White,,"Often times, shirts ordered online can have some pretty strange sizing. Almost like an inch isn’t an inch everywhere. And it can be worse when the generic S, M, L, XL, etc. is used. Happily, this white long sleeve dress shirt from Chef Works fits true to size with no problem, just as if I got it after trying it on at a brick & mortar store here. Made from a 64% Polyester, 34% Cotton, 2% Elastane (aka Spandex), the shirt has a hidden button down front, adjustable cuffs and is machine washable. The only thing missing is my preference of a left front pocket. Definitely not a deal breaker as many shirts are tailored without a chest pocket now. Overall, this is a great shirt, well made to fit and looks sharp. I give it a 5 Star recommendation.",

I have lost some pounds and I thought I'd gamble on a Large size (instead of XL) and it fit just fine. The shirt looks and feels very nice. It says ""Chef's Work,"" so I assume it's for that kind of work, but this can definitely work for a formal setting which is my intention.  Overall, this is a very nice shirt for formal wear.",

However, sometimes I wear size large shirts, and sometimes XL.  I ordered XL and it turns out the XL is a bit too large for me.  We will see if it will shrink at all in a hot water wash and drying.  Otherwise, the shirt will have to be used only under a suit and tie to hide that it is a little large.",

Jonathan Pedrone,Decent shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32979SO7A70IR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNKWQ6CP,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 8, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: White,,"This dress shirt is well constructed, easy to care for, and comfortable to wear.  The shirt comes in regular sizes (small - XXXL) so it is not a fitted dress shirt.  The shirt is comfortable to wear and fit me to size.  The shirt buttons come with a flap over them so the buttons are covered which is a little bit annoying when trying to put the shirt on and taking it off.The collar of the shirt is a bit wider and has less structure than I would like on it as well.  The flaps on the collar are a bit larger than I would like and they tend to hang down a bit when I wear the shirt.  Other than that the shirt is well priced and comfortable as well.",
Robert Strecker,this is a reliable shirt that will last a long time,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39B6I8O6S34PI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNKWQ6CP,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 8, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"Twenty years ago when i was in my teenage years, i worked in the hotel business often such as i still do, though now focus on resorts. I found out a secret back then about the standard button down solid color long sleeve shirt. I have been wearing that kind of shirt now for most of my life and i still maintain my opinion about the shirt secret. This secret is, that uniform or mass produced shirts that are low in priced, will last forever if it is of the food service variation. What i mean by that is after thirty years of wearing button down shirts i can safely say that the uniform type of solid black button down shirt can be utilized in a unique way. I have found out that if i toss in one of those types of low priced but super strong shirt into a five shirt selection work week, it will be hard for anyone to tell the difference. This is a technique that i have been using for a long time. I will wear a super expensive solid black button down shirt one day then the next a thirty dollar button down shirt that can often be found in a food service clothing catalogue or particular brand. With this traditional restaurant grade, but not chef style, solid black button down shirt from the Chef Works brand, i have found just that type of low priced shirt i love. Do not let the brand name fool you; this is a regular button down shirt. It just has thicker material that can withstand restaurant types of conditions. Another trick to hiding some of the thicker material such as around the cuffs, if for some reason you are super particular about that kind of thing, you just pop on a blazer over it. My style is to wear more high quality shirts within the five day work week, so that when i wear a low priced but awesome shirt like this one and no one will know. That's how i get away with tossing in a thirty dollar shirt with others that are double or triple the price. I for sure recommend this shirt because it is low priced and will last a long time.",
