Quality is felt throughout the shirt - the fabric is nice and thick, but not very breathable. It almost feels like there's an extra layer of fabric.  The collar doesn't have a button, which is a plus - since it adds a more casual look to the shirt. Overall, a comfortable dress shirt to have, and it's a plus that I was able to snag it in Pink.",

Christopher Kouzios,Not a bad dress shirt for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YODDDHM3OLC7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDX78Y59,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 19, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Dark Blue,,"I have a ton of dress shirts that I wear to work. It’s extraordinarily hot and humid down here in Florida so finding a shirt that is not only comfortable, but looks good, is wrinkle free and also can take the heat and humidity is a tough find. Finding one at this price point that isn’t garbage is almost impossible, but they managed to pull it off. The shirt itself feels comfortable and stretchy. The buttons feel like they’ll stay on. The shirt made it through the wash and dry cycle and while it didn’t come out totally wrinkle free a quick run through with the steamer and it was good to go. No dry cleaner necessary. For the price of this shirt, I will definitely pick up several others in different colors… Well worth it.",

The stitching is well made although the fabric could be a bit better, for my personal preference.  The shirt breathes well and fits true to size based on the size chart. Though the shirt is very attractive, I think a mixed fabric may work better for long term use.",
Ty Miller,Classic style and comfort - can't go wrong with this one,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BAJBNGGQDTXE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDX78Y59,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 18, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,,"You can spend less, and you can spend a LOT more for a staple, standard dress shirt like this, but you won't find anything a lot better.  Cut, size, quality, style - A's across the board. Feel is the real bonus with this one though. With most standard cotton dress shirts, you get a lot of wrinkling (which DOES happen with this shirt but not as badly as a pure cotton) and you can expect tension through the back, shoulders when reaching up or forward. This shirt has just the right mix of elasticity so you don't have to offer a little ""give"" without pulling loose of your belt, or straining the seams etc..  This is a classic. Get one in Black, gray, white and blue and you have the baseline for your professional wardrobe squared away.",

MandC,Formal dress shirt; serves its function,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WKY28B2OVZ1E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDX78Y59,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 14, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: White,,"I ordered this white formal dress shirt to go with a black suit. I am not overly impressed with the design; it has a pocket and while the collar is pointed, it is small in nature (making it most appropriate for a skinny tie). Unfortunately, a skinny tie paired with the style of this traditional shirt (not a non-slim fit design), are not complimentary.  I would say the sizes run slightly larger than ""true to size"" as well, with the arm sleeves having lots of extra fabric room and the length of the shirt allowing far too much fabric to tuck in. Overall, this formal shirt will serve its basic function, but don't expect much more than that.",
