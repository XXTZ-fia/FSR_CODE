The sheath dress fits true to size and unlike many sequined dresses, this is soft and not itchy or irritating. My daughter added a belt and loves the way it looks.  We were both excited about the overskirt, but this is problematic. It is really thin (one layer of tulle makes up the basic skirt and each ruffle is two thin layers gathered and stitched to it. It doesn't have any real fullness and just sort of drags. It is also WAY too long and drags a lot on the floor. The thin ribbon that you tie around your waist really doesn't look flattering or really support the overskirt in an attractive way and once tied tightly enough to hold it up, closes around the dress rather than looking open like in the photos.  My daughter has worn the short dress several times and loves it.

It would be perfect for so many occasions. The quality is great but I would definitely follow the care instructions and hand wash this set. It’s just the nature of sequined fabric and tulle, you will end up loosing some sequins and the tulle will fray and snag without gentle washing. The train is long but stunning. It’s a bit too long for my 48” 6 year old so we tied it as a cape and that is a beautiful way to wear it too. The dress is about right on her with a bit of room to fill it out.

The main thing to note is that the tie on skirt is quite long and is more of a train on my 10-year-old daughter who is above average height.  She didn't like how the dress did not have a tighter waistline. It is more of a sheath dress that's cut straight up and down.  The train skirt is quite beautiful with the layers of tulle. But when she tied it around her waist it basically fully closes and looks like a skirt because the front opening goes away. Basically the tulle is stitched too wide so when it's tied tight there's no gap in front.  Other than that, the quality of all of the materials is excellent.",
