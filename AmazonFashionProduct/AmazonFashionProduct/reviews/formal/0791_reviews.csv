The only thing that bothered me is the material is so thin and feels cheap, it's not warm, BUT it is not see-through and the wrinkles iron out very easily. Shapewear/bra lines are not visible under it, and overall I was very happy with and felt gorgeous in the dress.",7

It looks really classy and would be a great fall wedding guest dress. The slits aren't too high. The material is pretty lightweight. It wrinkles easily, but also steams out easily.  I want to love it. I just feel like something is off. After a long time looking at it, I feel like the place where the faux wrap is attached at the waist is too centrally located. Most wrap dresses have the connection point off to the side. This is almost committed to being on a side, but it's too close to the middle to be flattering. It makes it seem like it's too small on top (looks like the girls are spilling out in the middle and deforming the line of the faux wrap), even though in reality, there's plenty of room in the dress for someone bustier than I am (I'm a 36D and ordered a medium). So it feels a little funky up there. Other than that, it's gorgeous and looks really nice!",

The skirt is half lined because of the slits and, while you can see the under skirt cutoff through the white fabric, the lining is absolutely opaque.

It flows really nicely and it wouldn't be a problem if it were to shrink a little in the wash.

The size small fit me very well. It accentuates my waist with a flattering fit. The fabric was surprisingly nice and looked elegant. It didn’t look or feel as cheap as it was either. I wore it to my husband’s white coat ceremony and felt that I was perfectly dressed for the occasion! You could easily dress this up or down depending on the day. I fully recommend this modest dress 💕",
