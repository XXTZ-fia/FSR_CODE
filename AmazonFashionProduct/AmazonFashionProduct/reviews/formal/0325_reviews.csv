My whole entire closet was burned. All my suits ties and shirts gone a very good friend of mine had his mom pass, and the services were only three days out. I needed to move fast and I didn't want to go to the moral shopping and looking around and paying exorbitant prices. Took to Amazon and found this suit. It arrived a day and a half later. The pants are well cut, and they have an elastic expander which made them fit perfectly on my waist. They were also hemmed, which was completely surprising to me because I don't have to do them myself or take them to a tailor. Perfect length. The vest and jacket fit nicely, but a little snug for my body type. The medium in my opinion will be suitable for anyone between 172 pounds to 180. I'm 5'10 with a little extra weight around the belly, with wider back and shoulders. I picked the medium based upon the inseam and the measurements provided as a guide. I am so close with the medium to it being tight to where I'm bulging out of the jacket but tight enough where I could've went with a large. It'll have to do. It looks sharp. I will post the pics when I finally received my tie and I can put the whole thing together. I am pleasantly surprised. It's not perfect, but far from flawed. I've actually seen worse at JCPenney and Macy's for a whole lot more four five times the price. Update: I figured I'd take a chance and purchase a Large in hopes of getting it next day. It came next day. Fits so much better. Sending the Medium back Keeping the large. So grateful. This got me out of a jam and lots of stress time and money. I can pay my respects with dignity",7
