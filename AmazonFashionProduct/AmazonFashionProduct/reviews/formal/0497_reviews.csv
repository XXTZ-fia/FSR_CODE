I'm 5'2"", 115lb, and the Small fit well. The design is just not right for my body type. On my short torso, the waist meets the bodice exactly at my belly button, meaning a little tummy bulge is highlighted just below the waistline seam of the dress. The overall length on my 5'2"" frame hit just below mid-calf, not terribly unflattering, but IMHO, above the knee or floor length is better for short legs. I would also warn that the thin fabric is just a bit 'shiny', which looks low quality. The built-in skirt lining is rare, necessary for thin fabric, and a nice addition. But this is not a keeper for me.",

Average build. I do have narrow shoulders, but literally had to take in the shoulders by an inch. As shown in the pictures, the wrist is loose.  And now for the good stuff: I travelled with it to Europe. NO wrinkles. TOTALLY comfortable. GREAT length for autumn. The color is great - muted and yet deep. Everyone who has seen it loves it. The pockets are also great. In comparison, I ordered an XS in a different color. The XS fit me MUCH better on the shoulders, but was TIIIIGHT around the waist. This seemed a bit unusual to me - seems like most people would want more flexibility in the waist? Still, since I know how to sew I fixed the small by taking in the shoulders. I ended up keeping both. With the shoulders fixed, the green one is more comfortable in the waist line and also acceptable in the shoulders. The XS will be a nice back up, but is less comfortable.",3

The elastic in the cuffs is not tight  so the sleeves slide down my hand too far.  I think I can tighten with a stitch to ensure they stay where they should.  Haven't washed it yet.
