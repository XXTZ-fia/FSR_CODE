I'm happy to say this shirt in that size fits me as expected; It's not loose or tight in any way. I do note this shirt is a touch shorter in torso length than my normal go-to dress shirt, but there's still plenty to tuck into my pants waistband.  I've only worn this shirt a couple of times, and even with a machine wash, this shirt hasn't wrinkled up on me. Although, the machine wash did slightly ripple the shirt, so before I wear it to an occasion, I would probably iron it anyway.

In regard to the sizing....I was not sure how do use their size chart. I am a 42 chest with a bit of a paunch, 5' 9"" tall and 175 pounds. According to their chart, I should be a Small, which would be ridiculous. I ordered my regular size, Large.....which was the right choice. My advice is to order your usual size and forget the size chart. All in all....its a great shirt. Definitely recommended",
