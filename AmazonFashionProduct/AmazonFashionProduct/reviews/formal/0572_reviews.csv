I usually wear them untucked.This last batch came folded in some thin clear plastic boxes.  Even after washing, they still had a lot of sharp creases in them.  I began to worry but after ironing them, they're all gone and it was a cinch to do.  Start with low heat and steam and increase as needed to effectively remove the creases.  Once they come off with one or two passes, you're at the right temp.  You must use steam or you run the risk of burning them when pressed dry.  But now they're smooth and ready to go.Wash first, then press.  If you press them straight from the package, you'll smell the chemicals that are used in their construction and treatment of the fabric.  Eww.  Once washed, the smell is gone.",
