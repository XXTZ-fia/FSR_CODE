Sean/Mia,Perfect dress for my sister in laws wedding,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10GBGSO06MT7H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFQ9214D,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Color: WhiteSize: XX-Large Plus,Verified Purchase,She felt and looked beautiful she said it felt like good quality and she looks like a bride 10/10 and it shipped right on time for her last minute wedding we ordered on Monday and it came on Thursday the same week! For reference she for a XXL and she is 5’5,
LoveMeSomeAmazon,Flattering dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38TLEB9ZV2Z2H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFQ9214D,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Color: BlackSize: X-Large Plus,,"This is just a bit big in the chest area for me but it’s still quite flattering on. (For reference I’m a 38C and ordered size XL.) It has a forgiving cut, shape and seams for someone like me who has developed a little extra weight in the tummy and hips. It’s soft and has a nice flow to it. I added a belt as I feel it needed that little extra touch and overall I’m happy with this dress.",
M. E.,Cute but not for me,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EEV2C7CP36BY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFQ9214D,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 28, 2024",Color: Emerald GreenSize: X-Large Plus,,"This dress is really cute. I love that the v-neck is sewn together, so there are no gaps. However, I do not have enough up top to make it look good. I'm sure that someone who is more well-endowed would look beautiful in it. I'm not a huge fan of the feeling of lace, but it's not itchy or hard like some lace. The fabric underneath is very swishy and comfortable.",
Damian,Nice dress but looks funny,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL58B4CPJZFJQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFQ9214D,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 23, 2024",Color: BlackSize: 4X-Large Plus,,"I picked this up for my girlfriend (I love how she looks in dresses) and while the dress fit just fine it looked very odd once worn. It looks like it was not made to hug the correct areas that make a dress look pretty. It was nicely made and the material was soft and looked nice under the light with a lot of detail so it was very odd to me that it did not retain it's beauty once worn. The cut was just off in too many places to redeem. For the price you want something useful and not some ""knock around the house"" garment. It's not a bad dress at all but if you are going for a classic dress fit you may want to think twice about picking this one up.",
Elizabeth Olin,Great!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1N1WU80N4YVWK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFQ9214D,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 23, 2024",Color: BurgundySize: 4X-Large Plus,,Fit as expected and looks great!,
randee,"Pretty Design, but Quality Could Be Better",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LJIZJTKLTK3Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFQ9214D,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 21, 2024",Color: Emerald GreenSize: X-Large Plus,,"I ordered this dress in XXL Green, and for reference, I’m 190 lbs and 5'3"". The fit is mostly okay, though it does feel a little snug in the chest area. The overall design is nice, and I especially like the waterfall effect in the front—it’s very flattering and gives the dress a touch of elegance.  The quality of the lace, however, is disappointing. It feels scratchy and not as soft as I’d hoped. That said, the dress does have a lining, which makes it more comfortable to wear despite the lace’s texture. I’ve washed it once, and it seemed to hold up fine, which is a relief.  It’s a decent option if you’re looking for an affordable formal dress, but don’t expect high-end materials. The design is lovely, but the fabric quality could use improvement.",
Claudette Roese,Pretty,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1A17N9RBLY8H6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFQ9214D,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 14, 2024",Color: WhiteSize: XX-Large Plus,Verified Purchase,Good price. Quality is good.  Light weight,
Robyn,"Odd Fit, Not Flattering",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PS81CUS9RC5N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFQ9214D,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2024",Color: BurgundySize: 3X-Large Plus,,"This was a disappointment. The top doesn't lay right and is too tight across the chest. Too short in the top as well so the waist is too high and hits me just under the bust. the dress is unflattering, usually a wrap dress is very flattering on me. This dress pulls in weird ways, is uncomfortable, and non comfortable on. It's like the dress was designed for someone small and simply made wider instead of adjusting the fit for plus size bodies. Unfortunately I see this a lot in plus size clothes. There are much better options out there at a similar or even better price.",

LawyerMom,It's ok,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16MOR9DQPNR0V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFQ9214D,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 3, 2024",Color: BlackSize: X-Large Plus,,"It's not bad looking and size is probably accurate.  The lace fabric is very soft and not scratchy at all.  The lining feels cheap and gets static clingy very easily.  Dress is ok, but seems overpriced.  I wouldn't recommend for black tie events, it's a dress that can be worn in casual setting as well.",
Sara,The chest is really weird.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LJABOCAIU0CW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFQ9214D,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 30, 2024",Color: WhiteSize: X-Large Plus,,"I am a 2x, I ordered the 1x after reading some reviews saying it runs large, and it fits me perfect.  However, the way they fastened the chest is SO weird.  It's like loose fabric and then they tacked it together with a small bit of thread, which causes the chest to pucker and fit very badly.  I used a seam ripper to remove that bad stitching and repined it in a lower position, which helped but didn't fix the issue completely as there is just SO much fabric on the chest.  I have J cups and this was still too odd fitting and big in the chest for me.",

H-Team,Comfortable lace dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPZ4N6SCJE27K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFQ9214D,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 29, 2024",Color: Emerald GreenSize: 4X-Large Plus,,"Comfortable lined lace dress I probably could've gone down a size from the size chart because it really goes by your chest measurement not your stomach measurement. The sleeves are comfortable. They hide some flaws without being stuck all up in your armpits, which I can't stand, if I'm not comfortable I will sweat and just be in a bad mood. The top is flattering and will cover any ""assets"" nicely and fully cover any shape-wear and bra straps. I wish there was a little bit more elastic at the Empire waste. I will probably dress it up with a pin where the ruffle starts It is a good length,  lace dresses that I've worn in the past have gotten caught on heels, but this is long enough to cover the legs and look formal but short enough where it doesn't , get caught on heels or the ankle buckles on the straps.",4
Rachel,Cute but runs a little small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L3FZ583SWGKY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFQ9214D,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 28, 2024",Color: BlackSize: 4X-Large Plus,,"This is a chic black lacey dress, that looks really cute on me. But it does feel like it runs a little bit smaller than other amazon dresses I have tried. The fabric also gets VERY staticky, which isn't great for the upcoming colder weather. But other than that, I like it a lot and it's flattering. It is a little snug in the chest, and the waistband is tighter than I expected, but it still fits. It's just not as loose or as comfortable as I thought it would be. I'd suggest sizing up if you're at the top part of a size's measurements.",
Anna,Beautiful dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFX4ETYVZRMG3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFQ9214D,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 28, 2024",Color: BurgundySize: 3X-Large Plus,,"I usually go between a 2x-3x depending on the place and, based on other reviews of this running small, I went with the 3x.  This was the correct move on my part as it turned out to be the perfect fit--not too loose or too tight.  V-necks worry me because they never seem to fit me right, but this one surprisingly did!  The material is a little stretchy which makes it easy to put on.  I had no issues.  The fabric against the body is comfortable.  It's a beautiful dress that I plan to wear for Christmas.",
Ixtaek,Slightly See through,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UC3EID3ISMWC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFQ9214D,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 27, 2024",Color: WhiteSize: XX-Large Plus,,"This dress is fairly standard, and the design is charming. The flap at the top is stitched down in one spot to provide modesty, or you can pick it apart to put your own pin in. The material has good stretch and fit decently well on me. My main complaint is that it is ever so slightly see-through. Admittedly I was wearing dark undergarments when I tried it on, and really looking hard to see if I could make them out. I could see the dark part but not make out the shape clearly. I’m not sure if it would be more noticeable outside since I tried it on indoors. With a slip it would likely be fine.",

The fit though was a different story. I’m 5’11 / 250lbs and am a 2x in general. I ordered a 3x to be on the safe side and that was a joke…it definitely runs small. For me anyways. I barely squeezed into it and everything from the chest, armholes, waistline, etc was all wrong and awkward. Which is a bummer because I love the dress itself.",
