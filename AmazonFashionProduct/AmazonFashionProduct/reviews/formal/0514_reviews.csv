My daughter (6, bought that size also) loved it and the fact that it had a “cape.” She said after awhile it did bother her arms rubbing against the sequins but that’s honestly to be expected being sequins. I wouldn’t take away a star for it.  It fit her perfectly.",4

Ljd1978,Grace Karin for the win again - beautiful dress and excellent quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHT065EJRPEVN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN922RML,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 27, 2024",Size: 8-10 YearsColor: Rose Gold,,"My 8yo daughter has a father/daughter dance coming up next month so I ordered this dress for the special occasion.  I have ordered GRACE KARIN brand clothing (mostly dresses!) for both my daughters and myself quite a few times and I have never once been disappointed in the fit or the quality.This dress is downright gorgeous.  My daughter is 8yo, 65lbs and the size 10 fits her nicely.  She is very sensitive to how her clothing ""feels"" and this dress has a soft liner that prevents the sequins from being an irritant.  The style is very elegant and unique with the shimmering bodice and flowing outer skirt. I don't think my daughter could have been any happier with any other dress as this one is simply stunning.If you're looking for a special occasion dress, I can't recommend this one highly enough.  It's incredibly beautiful, well-made, and so unique that your daughter will likely feel like a princess when she wears it!",

The fitting is true to size. No weird itchy areas, and no off-putting chemical smell.  Grace Karin makes some beautiful dresses, and this is another one. The sequins are very sparkly and compliment the chiffon flowing skirt. You truly feel like a princess with power in this dress with the sparkles and chiffon train.  This halter dress is also very flattering and true-to-color. The only downside is the underarms - if you don't have breasts to fill the gap, you will need to wear some sort of undershirt or training bra to make sure you are modest. That is seriously the only complaint though. This is a great dress!",5

My daughter is 4, though, so this fits a bit to big. The quality, though, is great! It's got a nice shine with the sequins and the fabric is thick enough for it not to be uncomfortable, but thin enough for it to not be too hot. The tule train is super cute and she loves to twirl with it. Will definitely wear it to the next d/d dance when it fits. Until then, will keep it safe. Not sure about washing it. Since we don't have any event to wear it to, we haven't laundered it yet. If it doesn't survive, though, I'll update...and be sad. Until then, 5*.",
