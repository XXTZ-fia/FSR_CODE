Had I looked at the photos of people with 4 and 5 star reviews I would have understood the fit.  It is not flattering on most even though the people think it is.  On apple and pear shaped bodies it blobs out from the shoulders and people find that flattering because you can't see their middle.  I am not going to return it because that is too much trouble.  By tucking the underlayer in a pair of high waisted jeans I can get more shape back and salvage this, but I am going to wear it more like a t-shirt.  Definitely not dressy or formal.",
