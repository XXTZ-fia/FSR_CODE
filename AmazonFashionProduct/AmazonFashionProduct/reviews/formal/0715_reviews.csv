Most long sleeves shirts are too short for me, this one is not. Ordered XL to make sure it fit in the shoulders and didn’t gap at the chest. It’s fits great! I might could have gotten by with a large but I don’t want to feel restricted or have the sleeves raise up too far when reaching. It looks professional and didn’t wrinkle much during wear. I washed in cold water and dried on low heat. It still had wrinkles from shipping but was easy to press them out. I used a low to medium iron setting with an ironing cloth on top of the shirt to make sure I didn’t scorch it because this shirt is 100% polyester. It will probably wash up nice without wrinkles the next time. Ironing on a very low heat may work without an ironing cloth, but I’d be careful. If you don’t have an ironing cloth a simple plain pillow case will work. Just use it between the iron and the shirt. Even though this shirt is polyester it doesn’t have that typical feel. It feels more like a somewhat thinner cotton broadcloth to me. After this one I went back and purchased 4 more in different colors.",2

I washed it once and it was still a little stiff, but after the second wash it was fine. I hung this shirt to dry because it was a little snug in the bust.  I ordered the size is according to the size chart but it was snug in the bust. I normally wear a size XXL and have a 48 inch bust. It seems the shirt runs just a little small in the bust.
