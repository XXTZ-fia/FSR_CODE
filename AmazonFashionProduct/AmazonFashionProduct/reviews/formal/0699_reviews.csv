The material is far from what you think of when you think of a cable knit sweater. I think of New England fishermen with sweaters as thick as their beards. So, to my surprise what I got was something I can only describe as being on par with a stuffed animal you’d get at the State Fair. The material is very soft but its shimmery and just not what you’d expect of a men's sweater. As far as size goes it might as well be one size fits all, with its oversized fit and abundant stretchiness you could wrap a f’n boat for the winter in it.  The Suede elbow pads are just cloth backing or are sewn on backwards, either way if you plan on army crawling in the bad boys don’t be surprised if you blow the elbows out. To top it off it took 3 weeks to get here just for me to have to send it back on the slow boat it sailed in on.",7

The material feels nice, and especially feels soft and nice inside, when you put it on.  It fits me pretty well and it definitely looks good.  My main negative here though is that there were some loose little threads up around the buttons and on the collar...which gives it a slightly more average look if you look closely there.  But I will just snip those off with little scizzors so no big deal.  But it makes me think it might have looser threads, so might happen again, or perhaps it won't be as durable, I am not sure.  But it definitely otherwise looks great, and feels great to wear.  I would definitely recommend it for a decent sweater with a good look, although for the most premium or most long term durable you might want to look to higher price points.",

It fits to size.It's machine washable on cold, but hang dry or lay it flat to dry, because a dryer is not good for Viscose.  This is a very good value, and I highly recommend it.  Edit: I just got back from Edinburgh, Scotland (October 2024). In Scotland they say that ""every day has four seasons,"" which is true, so the strategy is to dress in layers. This sweater was perfect for that, both in Edinburgh and an excursion to the Highlands. It's warm, but not stifling. And it's stylish enough to wear for that smart-casual look.

It's not.  The plus: The sweater is pretty. It's soft and stretchy and comfortable. It runs small. And since it's made of viscose, it will shrink in the dryer. You might want to order two sizes up.  But here was the hidden deal killer for me: Despite its comfiness, this thing was plagued by a hard, scratchy, sewn-in tag which grates at the back of your neck. If the sweater were made of regular woven fabric, it would be easy to remove.  But it's not. This is a stretchy knit. So while I was able to use a tiny seam-ripper to successfully remove one side of the tag, I couldn't on the other side. Which resulted in a tiny hole in the back of the collar. And that tiny hole instantly grew as it unraveled, to about a half-inch across, rendering the sweater unusable. It's in my trash can.  So if you can endure a scratchy tag, it's great. Otherwise, be warned by my sorry experience with this thing.",9
