I didn't think it was thick enough and the fabric could be softer. Many people wear these over collared shirts like in the ad, so I think then it's just right.  It does have that kind of material that stretches out and loses its shape if you're not careful. So you can't hang this in your closet and you can't roll up your sleeves too much or it will look strange and not fit right.",
Ryan Metzer,Sleek Design with Comfortable Fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9B67SWNUGJW5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDY1Q9YD,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 9, 2023",Color: BlackSize: Small,,"As a participant in the Amazon Vine program, I had the opportunity to try out the COOFANDY Men's V Neck Dress Sweater. Here's my experience:  Pros:  Soft and Stretchy Material: The soft knit fabric feels good against the skin. It offers just the right amount of stretch, ensuring a snug, yet comfortable fit.  Versatile Style: The solid color, V-neck design, ribbed collar, cuffs, and hemline make this sweater a staple for any wardrobe. The black color, in particular, is sleek and can be paired with almost any outfit.  Applicable to Many Occasions: Whether it's for casual daily wear or a more formal setting like the office, this sweater fits right in. I've also found it to be a great layering piece, pairing well with jackets, blazers, and even a peacoat.  Easy Maintenance: The care instructions are clear. Both hand washing and machine washing are options. The sweater held up well after washing, with no noticeable shrinkage or pilling.  Cons:  Fit: While the sweater does fit well, the ""Small"" size might be a tad snug for some. It's essential to consult the size chart and consider personal comfort preferences when choosing a size. Conclusion:  The COOFANDY Men V Neck Dress Sweater combines style and comfort, making it a worthy addition to any wardrobe. Its versatile design ensures that it can be worn for various occasions, and the quality of the material promises durability. I recommend this sweater for anyone seeking a stylish and comfortable pullover.  Note: I received this product in the ""Small"" size and black color",

KC,A real dandy Coofandy sweater,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KT8KBSLQIMVJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDY1Q9YD,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 3, 2023",Color: Wine RedSize: X-Large,,Most men are looking for a comfortable stylish sweater to wear in either casual or semi-dressed settings.  This COOFANDY Men V Neck Dress Sweater fits the bill to a T.It is very comfortable to wear and the fabric is soft to the touch and a bit stretchy so it will fit almost every body type.  I chose the Wine Red color and sized up 1 size as I wanted it to be a looser fit as I usually wear a shirt underneath.  The entire sweater is made of a ribbed material and gives you a classy look.  The neck is a typical V neck style which allows you to wear another shirt underneath it comfortably.  The sleeves have an elastic band at the bottom keeping them snug against your wrists but not too tight.  The bottom of the sweater also has a band which gently hugs your waist but allows you to move comfortably without the sweater binding.I am very pleased with the quality and design of the sweater.  It has already become one of my current favorites.,

Well, this one comes through... the sweater is more comfortable and softer than I thought it would be.  It appears classy-casual looking without seeming stuffy or too, too much.  The material is not as soft as I thought it would be, but it doesn't disappoint the experience of wearing it.  It feels nice!  You feel a little dressy yet laid back.  It goes well with just about everything.  Versatile and fitted.  I think it will do fine in the Wash... probably shouldn't wash too frequently if can help it and it should hold up well.  Class it up on a casual night out or wear it in a comfortable easy-going setting with jeans, etc.  I wear a Medium, went with a Medium, and am happy with this Medium!Thumbs up and a good recommendation for this one… a good review and rating in my book.Fair and appropriate price point... Value with mid-line-quality. Nice overall choice for your sweater collection.  I'll continue to monitor the sweater's quality and longevity and if our rating changes after continuous use and washing we will update the review with additional information, pictures and a re-rating.
