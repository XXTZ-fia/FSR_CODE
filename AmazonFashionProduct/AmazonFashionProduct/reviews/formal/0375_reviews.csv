I'm not a huge fan of the one-bottom design, but since I don't often button the blazer, it's OK.",

The slim fit definitely complements me when I often don't like other jackets that tend to look bulky and unflattering.  This jacket fits well from what I can see - though I am not an expert on fits.  I think it looks great as a casual jacket for going to business events or nice restaurants.,

It's a coat.  The fit is slim but not tight. The sleeves are maybe a touch short for me.  The quality of the coat itself is much better than I anticipated. It seems well made and durable, it doesn't have that cheap, thin inner layer that so many inexpensive coats from the 90s had.  The one button design isn't my favorite, just because of how the cost falls when buttoned. But that's personal preference.  Overall it's a nice value coat.",
Kristen A,Great fit and good look for a casual upgrade,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAKZTKNWV4LMA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDY3R8FK,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 29, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"I got this for my teenage son's first sport coat to wear at school events. At 5'11"" and 141 pounds, the medium size fit him perfectly. Sleeves cover the wrists and when the single front button is fastened the chest isn't tight & the waist is slightly tapered which creates a stylish look. It looks good on him. Four pockets total: one inner pocket, one outside lapel and two outside hip --- all great for stashing a cell phone or cards (or, in my son's case, candy lol). He loves it and says it looks ""cool"" so that's a win for me!",

The blazer features a notched lapel, one-button closure, and flap pockets, making it both functional and fashionable. The inside real pocket is a nice addition for storing small items. The craftsmanship is top-notch, with attention to detail in the stitching and materials used. One thing to note is that the sizing might run a bit small, so consider sizing up if you prefer a looser fit. Overall, this blazer is a great addition to any wardrobe, offering style, quality, and practicality.",

I like blazers, but cannot stand that most of them will tell you to dry clean. This will allow you to throw it in the wash, but it does say do not tumble dry. I will have to update my review in the future if it falls apart in the wash.  Two reasons why I have to dock 1 star: the cuffs are actually fake. The buttons are sewed on, but the cuff really is just an aesthetic. Also, whlie it feels slim fit to the body, the arms feel unreasonably fat in the upper arm region albeit with limited mobility. It feels strange, and I think part of it is for being so thick that it becomes stiffened in that region.",

The jacket has a beautiful style, and lovely material. It also is fairly thick, so it works very well for the autumn season. When you have cooler temperatures, this blazer would be a great stylish coat to wear, which would keep you warm, and looking slick. The tailoring is very nice, and everything is true to size from my sample, and experience. I really love the color as well, and find that it goes well with formal, to semi formal styles. It would suit a pair of dress pants, as well as it does a pair of jeans. All in all, I find nothing to complain about whatsoever, and am very much in love with this jacket. I'd certainly recommend it.",

It is a bit more on the informal side not necessarily as a work jacket. It only has one button but I do prefer two and the one sits a bit lower than I prefer. It is tweed so it is a bit warmer not necessarily a spring summer jacket. I wear usually a 42/44 and got the large. The sleeves are a good fit but the length is a bit shorter than I prefer. Still it looks like a well made jacket and can wear it for an evening night out.,

As advertised the fit is slim. Slim isn't the best choice for me, but the fit is more than good enough for something out of the box.  The herringbone fabric has much more heft that I had assumed.

Even though it's not a natural fiber, and the price reflects that already, it looks and wears like a nice sports coat.  Unbeatable value for money, which is why I've giving it 5/5.

Now, this is 100% polyester, so you're not getting a top-of-the-line wool sport jacket here, but the weight of the fabric and the lining are actually pretty decent, and this won't leap out to a casual observer as being super cheap jacket. Main downside is that it comes crammed into a shipping envelope and thus will arrive very wrinkled. Quite a bit warmer than I had expected (it's more a fall or winter jacket).",
