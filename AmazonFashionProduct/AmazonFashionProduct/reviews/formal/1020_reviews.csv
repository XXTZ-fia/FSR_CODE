I liked the color and the material. But the problem is it came very tightly vacuum packed in plastic. When I opened it the buttons had imprinted on the sweater in various places because they had pressed so hard into the fabric for I don't know how long - how ever long it was packaged that way. Its not something you can iron out because its indented into the fabric now. I let it hang on a hanger for days hoping they might fall out or at least lessen. I tried massaging the spots a little to see if the fabric would spring back at all and fill in the indents. No luck with anything I've tried. Its really a disappointment because I like the sweater and was hoping to wear it with nicer outfits but it looks bad with the indented spots with the button imprint in random spots over the sweater. Too bad. I haven't worn it yet, but I may just wear it around the house now because I can't bring myself to wear it out like that.",2
