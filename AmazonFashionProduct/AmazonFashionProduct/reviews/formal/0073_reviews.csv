Aaron G.,BUY THIS SHIRT!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9WGLL7T2HU2Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMZXD15B,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"Holy heck! This shirt is more than expected! For 30 years I’ve bought traditional fabric dress shirts. I took a gamble because I wanted to try something new. I figure, “hey, it’s 15 bucks…” when I got it, it was stretchy and just weird to me(because I’m use to Oxford materials). After washing, the wrinkles from packaging were still there and I assumed I would have to spend money at the dry cleaners to get those manufacture wrinkles out. I was so wrong! They came out after one pass!!! I’m truly impressed and sold on it. Super lightweight and flexible! I will definitely buy more. To the makers of this shirt: Go home tonight with your head high. Be proud of your work, it’s amazing!",

While it boasts a flattering fit and impressive wrinkle resistance, the material quality leaves much to be desired.  Pros:  Fit: The shirt fits true to size and drapes well on the body. Wrinkle Resistance: It retains its shape remarkably well, even after a long day of wear. Cons:  Material Comfort: The fabric feels uncomfortable against the skin, causing itchiness. Material Quality: The material quality seems subpar for a dress shirt, lacking the expected softness and breathability. Overall:  While the Alimens & Gentle Men’s Dress Shirt excels in fit and wrinkle resistance, the discomfort caused by the material significantly detracts from its overall appeal.
