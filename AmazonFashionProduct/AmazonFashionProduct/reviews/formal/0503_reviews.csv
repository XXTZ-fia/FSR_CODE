Daniel J.

So take a good look in the mirror and be honest if you have more in the middle then the top because this is a slim fit shirt that may be a bit to tight on you where you don't want.  Other than that is a wash and wear wrinkle free shirt which are my favorite types.  The material is 94% Polyester, 6% Spandex so you have a little give and flex in some areas.  It is stylish with the black stand out buttons.  And the price is very reasonable.  I needed another white shirt, this worked, and I am happy I got it.",

It seems a little TOO much on the slim side, such that I felt it a little more constricting than expected.  I wasn't overly optimistic in my selection of size either, so I'll just chalk that up to a manufacturer difference in tailoring and cut.  This isn't unusual though...Construction is really quite good though.  Love the soft feel here, and of course wrinkle-free is always a plus.  Wash and wear, and really take it out of the dryer promptly . It's wrinkle-free but that does come with limits.  Keep it crumpled in a ball for a week and you'll see those limits.Aside from a somewhat aggressive slim-tailoring, I like this shirt.  It'd be a great item for the appropriate body type.",

It arrived wrinkled because of how it was packaged. Once l ironed out the wrinkles, they didn’t return. It is a business formal shirt intended to be worn tucked inside the pants. Relative to the price, good value.",2

Hermione G.,"Ok not great, but fine for the money",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2V4DCIBA1H3K9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFD14XHZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 1, 2024",,,"This is running $25 at time of review, less a $10 coupon, so I'm looking at a $15 shirt. In that context, it's four stars, but if it had cost more, that would be a hard no.  I went up a size for my spouse, and I'm glad I did because it's a perfect fit. He takes a 35"" sleeve, and the sleeves were plenty long. I don't think they'd go up to a 37"", but if you're a 36"", you might be okay. The neck measurement of the size he got is bigger than his actual neck measurement, but I'm not sure how they're measuring since the sleeve is bizarro.  The fabric is meh. It is NOT soft. It has that polyester texture that you don't want - that not all polyester actually has, by the way. It does have some stretch, but not tons, just as you'd expect for a button-down that has some spandex content in the fabric.  For $15, it's not bad.",

The fit can fall into the ""slim"" category, but don't expect a modern version or in other words Euro/Asian Cut. I recommend to get the same size like you normally do, but expect the good qualities of a slim cut shirt like streamlined fit. Some missing qualities with this dress shirt are the stretch quality could be better, and the buttons are a tad small for liking which can be a hassle for people with big hands.",

The shirt is 94% polyester and 6% elastine. It has little to no stretch.  I would consider this shirt a slim fit or very fitted shirt. My husband wears a XXL or XLT. He is 6’3”, 220 pounds and wears a size 34 waist jeans. We ordered this shirt in a XXL. He humored me to try it on with one button fastened but it is not something he will end up wearing. It is much too tight across the shoulders and fits him as if it’s a full size too small. If he reached across the car, it would rip out the shoulder seam. He also said he wished the arms were longer.  I hope my thoughts and opinions and photos help someone decide if they need a new dress shirt for their wardrobe.",

Anonymous,"Good shirt, be sure of the sizing",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2W1CVPNUJTAG1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFD14XHZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 26, 2024",,,"Overall, this is a good shirt. It's nice enough to wear to the office and feels comfortable. The collar does not have stays in it, and there are no slots for putting your own in, so you will have to rely on the fabric alone to keep its shape. The buttons are well attached and are nicely black (I hate black shirts with white buttons!) and the stitching overall is good. The material is slightly stretchy, so its has enough give to fit comfortably. Note on the sizing: I got a ""small,"" which was the smallest size offered. I am 5'9"" and weigh 140, with a 36"" chest. The product page lists the small as having a 43.3"" chest measurement, so it's a little baggy on my frame. That's not a fault with the product, it's just that it may not fit you trimly if you are my size. It does fit well on my friend, who is about a 42"" chest.",

Good slim fit design and narrow collar Most of the shirts I buy are wash and dry friendly, and either non-iron or they at least come out fresh enough that a quick steam pass is enough to make them presentable. Not here - I cheat and put the shirt in the dryer on low ... came out quite wrinkled. Sizing chart really needs to be improved as the way they measure sleeves and collar is totally different from ""normal"" measurement. I took a guess and got Medium not Small (I'm usually between the two) and M was far too large for me. At least an inch too long on the sleeves and shoulders.",

I don't know why some things can be machine washed and dried and others cannot, but again I don't care. It either can or it cannot. This shirt cannot be machine dried, which makes it less usable for me. Also, it was understandably wrinkled during shipping and I always wash my new clothes before wearing them. After coming out of the (less than half-full) washing machine and hanging it up to dry (grrrr), it was every bit as wrinkled as it was going in. So clearly there will need to be ironing involved, further reducing the overall usability of this shirt for me.",
