The dress zips up so you can have a good figure fit.  There is also stretch to the fabric which allows for size adjustment where needed.  The ""jacket"" is actually more like a drape with enforcement around the neck.  This piece needed a little light pressing to remove the wrinkle but looked so polished together.  The sequins are well stitched and the dress looks like it could be hand washed and hung to dry with no problems. This dress would be a good cocktail/wedding dress and look nice with any other jacket type.For the quality and purpose of this dress, it is reasonably priced.",

Tree Gallagher,"Even more pleasing on than on the hanger, impressive!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LDF9G9XVBBZO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6GKX9C5,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 4, 2024",Color: BlackSize: 10,,"What a pleasant surprise this gorgeous beaded, & sparkly dress with back zipper and accompanying wrap turned out to be! I have ordered other special occasion dresses, only to be let down when the dress itself looked great on the hanger? But disappointing on my body, sadly disappointing. Leaving me more depressed than I was before those arrived. Developing a ""dress a phobia"" as all the exteriors looked lovely, seemed to be I was the bad factor. I stopped looking for upscale dresses, and therefore stopped accepting invitations that I lacked confidence to attend. I felt ugly outside, and so sad inside. Maybe sounds silly, and/or self absorbed, or egocentric? But I was neither, just older and in a place I so lacked any pieces of the woman I once was due to a lot more than just how I viewed myself in a dress. But the lack of finding even one semi flattering dress was adding to my internal disappointment .  Okay, enough as to me, lets go on here to the star of this scenario! Saw it, loved it, ordered it. It was honestly better than I thought at first look! The cut is flattering to my larger upper, then smaller downward. The back zipper seems to assist the fall to my middle. All just as anyone would want, curving upper, but instead of just goofing outwards as down? It etches slightly below the breast area, just enough to allow a curve, more than a bigger drop if that makes sense. The length is cocktail, flattering to all, and the light catching exterior is amazing in contrast of the inside silky lining, wow, its just a wow!  The accompanying wrap is much more than I originally thought as it looked to me like the basic wrap? But its multi wearable, shoulders wrapped, of course, but the flowing material drapes and the ability to wear it as a neck covering (maybe just me, I know) scarf styled, upscaled in fashion forward, and also as flattering as the entirety provides! As ridiculous as I am sure I sound here, I actually wore it around the house for a bit, as the tiny and little one were out? As my older son, so I indulged. Even more ridiculous as there are boxes over boxes over basically every square inch of my condo. So I was trotting around, heels added and all all over areas I could have fallen over a box at any minute. Im sure I looked as I stated I did, silly and without good common sense, but I didn't care! The FIRST time I felt good in months! Now no, did not cover and solve all that brought me to the dark period, of course not. However, it DID provide the moments of ""feeling myself"" I so desperately needed in spark to start the moving forward. I owe it all to this gorgeous, sparkling dirndl, yes. Fancy word for top and bottom covering, but this flattering beauty deserves a higher descript than the ""dress""... At the time ordered, there were various colors available, I may go grab the scarlet color for Christmas! It fits to form with the complementary cut as I described. I decided to go with a size 10, optimistic (trying to be) to move away from the less then flattering 12 I most often choose with miserable results. So as I also have a larger upper area, and the way it slightly tucks in below that? To me is part of the difference I didn't know I was missing! So MAYBE try a size you think will be a bit less then the dress with more which never looked alright on me. But DO obtain this dress if needed, or if not needed! Its economically feasible, as most I have tried prior are MUCH higher in asking. On the chance maybe you might need a bit of a confidence booster as I did? You might say its priceless, I know I did! Thank you!",2
