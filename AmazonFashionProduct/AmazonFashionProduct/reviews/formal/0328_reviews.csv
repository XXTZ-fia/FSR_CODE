Jhoana Guerrero,Muy Contenta,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PJW7SDCGAZ53/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BZJ3NVML,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2025",Size: 14Color: Black-bowtie,Verified Purchase,"Este traje fue mas de lo que yo esperaba, mi hijo pesa 120 libras (54 kg) y mide  4.9 pie (1.50cm) tiene 11 años. El traje le quedo perfecto, le compre la talla 14, lo malo es que lo perdera rapido ya que le quedo justo, pero se le veia hermoso y mi hijo quedo contento con su traje. La camisa no es gruesa pero con el chaleco se ve muy bien, en terminos generales quede contenta con lo que compre y el precio fue bastante bueno para que trajera 4 piezas. Muchas gracias por que me llego a tiempo",

My son had his kids Marine corps ball. When searching, this brand popped up. Saw the cream colored option and instantly loved it. Appreciated all the options it came with. Pants, shirt, vest and tie. Very happy with the quality and the price. My son has a small waist but he's tall for a 5 year old and being able to adjust the waist band was a life saver! He was able to move freely. The size 6 was comfortable and fit very well. Only feedback I have is about the tie. It came on an elastic band and was pretty loose. No way to adjust it. Other than that minor flaws. Great product!",
