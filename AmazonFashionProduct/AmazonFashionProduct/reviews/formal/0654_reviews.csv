I didn’t see many reviews about a smell so I assume they saved that for my order.  I liked the material and the dress itself but it can’t be worn because of the chemical smell it has. I even let it air out overnight and the dress still stank.  I ordered it for a funeral and I’m now in a crunch to find something else to wear.  It can’t be washed and is labeled dry clean only. So I can’t even try to clean it without it being.  What an inconvenience! Returning ASAP!,

I wore this dress to a purple themed birthday party, but really want every color now to wear for church and other events. Overall, this was a great choice, and I will be ordering more.",34

The material is very comfy and doesn’t get wrinkles easily.
