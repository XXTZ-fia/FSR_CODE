It's very well made and even has the extra button on the sleeve, so if you want to make it 3/4 sleeve cuff very simple. There really is no ironing needed. Which for me is important.  No matter how hard I try or plan, I'm always running behind. It comes in 31 colors, so I bought a back up in dark grey.  My work shirts used to be $70-$90, considering the only real difference is the brand. I wasted a lot of money. Great find !",6
