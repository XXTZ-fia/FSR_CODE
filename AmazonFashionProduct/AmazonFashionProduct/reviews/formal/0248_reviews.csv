I own a dozen pieces from Coofandy and I've been converted to buying more Coofandy because it always fits great and looks great.This shirt however, is not the color as pictured in the listing.  I was hoping for a muted color like in the listing photo, but this is a much more vibrant color.  I've attached a photo taken of the shirt under sunlight and shadow.  Holding this image on my phone next to the shirt, I adjusted the color settings until it looked as close as possible to the shirt to give you a better idea of what this color actually is.  It still looks great, but I don't look good in vibrant colors.  I have a tan, so I tend to go for muted colors.  This shirt is still beautiful, it's just not for me.",

The Girl Utah,100% solid addition to the wardrobe- dress it up or down with color!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CCUTNIMIJC1N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDY41ZDK,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 27, 2023",Color: VioletSize: XX-Large,,"In a world of needing business shirts on a daily basis.. this is a solid addition to the lineup! Mine needs x5 days a week- yet, not everyday needs a “fancier” starched and trimmed option! These are a perfect price point to add a few and swap out as it begins to look tattered. With all the various color these bring a refreshing variety and mix/match with a tie collection really well..  Fabric is more than respectable.. not too thin, feels slick and good against skin- doesn’t have that dreaded cheap sheen. Shirt cleans up with a steam press really well- I favor bc, it doesn’t take a lot of effort to care for. Can be laundered at home on cold/line dry- then, quick steam/dewrinkle cycle and have a ‘good as new’ appearance.  Has ability to be worn with/without a tie- and although stand alone collar isn’t reinforced, it still has merit to its structure. Button sleeves can be worn rolled up for casual activity and finished hem line could also tuck in/out for a casual dinner date or else- pressed, tucked, buttoned and tied up for a work day meeting!  Sizing as expected- this has a more general fit bc of xs-xl type style sizing vs. neck/body/arm numeric sizing for a tailored look. IF, between sizes I suggest going up. Mine ordered XXL and it fit better in body/sleeve length. For reference: 50yr old, 6’4”, 225lb, 36x36. Violet color is more of a grayish hue.. my only disappointment. Otherwise, great filler or everyday work shirt that serves its purpose well. Hoping info can help- stay safe everyone.",
Thomas Reed,Adequate Fitting Dress Shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYZSB98EAFCO7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDY41ZDK,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 26, 2023",Color: WhiteSize: X-Large,,"The Coofandy white dress shirt was ordered for use with suits and sweaters.The polyester / viscose / spandex blended shirt was received and immediately tried on.  When opened from the package the shirt was wrinkled, but after being washed and hung to dry it was relatively wrinkle free.  I am 5'10"" tall, weigh 200 pounds, and have a 16.5 inch neck.  According to the Coofandy size chart, a Large size should have been ordered based upon my torso body size.  Also, there is no neck size chart for this shirt.  However, since I've had neck size vs body size issues with shirts ordered online in the past, an XL was ordered.  As it turned out, this was the right thing for me to do.  The collar fits me properly, and is very close to a 16.5 inch size.  The rest of the shirt also fits me a little large.  The one thing about this shirt that is displeasing is that it is short for a dress shirt, very short  It is almost like it should be worn outside the pants.  It will be worn as a dress shirt, but I will also need to watch that the shirt does not come out from the beltline.  The collar is made for a small knotted tie.  Thus, a Windsor knot or a thicker tie could not be worn with the collar on this shirt.  The sleeves are adequate for my 35 inch arms.The other comment is that my wife is of the opinion that the fabric is very thin for a dress shirt.  She indicated it was almost see-through.BOTTOM LINE:  This is an inexpensive & competively priced dress shirt that has little or no wrinkles when properly washed & dried.  This is a regular fit shirt, but the length is short for a dress shirt.  I would order the shirt again.",

It says the large has a waist of 45, and my waist is 40, so it SHOULD be loose, but it's not. In all fairness, I have to say that the Amazon Size-Bot said ""X-Large will fit you best based on millions of customer orders, returns, and reviews."", but I ignored it because the numbers looked like the Large would work -- I should have listened to to the Size-Bot! Actually, the rest of the shirt (size aside) is FANTASTIC! Soft, silky fabric with a combination of polyester, Viscose (I found out that ""Viscose"" is basically re-cycled Rayon), and a touch of spandex -- it has just a touch of stretch to it, which will make the Large work (barely, but especially if I wear a tie to cover the buttons which are pulled tight by my body) -- and I'm glad, because I really like the shirt. The size of the shoulders, sleeve length, and even the neck is all good for me -- it's just the lower chest and belly that is snug! The light green color is a perfect match for both my black suit and my multi-color brown suit jacket. COOFANDY makes some good clothes, and this is no exception!
