My fiancee is very happy that the sequins are covered in a mesh so they'll stay put better (she's a bit active and he does not share of love of all things sparkly).  While she isn't tall, this dress isn't as long on her as the model.  I'm a firm believer in shorts under dresses (note the active child) so I'm not concerned about her showing anything she shouldn't.  The tulle is quite wrinkly when it arrives out of the package, but I did do a light iron and easily get them out.",

When the child puts their arms down against the dress, the sequins don't rub against the skin.  The lower part of the dress is made of fluffy layers of tulle fabric. They overlay to make a beautiful layered floor length dress. The top section and bottom section are divided by a midline satin like fabric that ties into a bow in the back.

GOOD TO KNOW: - The size you normally buy (in the U.S.) is in the TAG SIZE in the size chart that is pictured. - It's a little roomy in the chest, but the adjustable strap and bow tie make it fitted enough so there's enough coverage. - The zipper is horrible! Another reviewer said it worked well but not on the dress we got.  WHAT I LIKE: - The best thing is how much my daughter loves wearing it. - It's lightweight and fun enough that it can be worn to a wide range of places, it doesn't need to be saved just for 'fancy' events. - The length works for shorter girls like my daughter who is usually one of the shortest in her class.  WOULD I BUY THIS AGAIN? Yes, absolutely!",
Rebecca VanFossen,Charming Emerald Green Dress with a Minor Wrinkle Issue,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16HJITJUXQG9M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D47FNX9S,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 27, 2024",,,"I recently ordered this stunning emerald green dress for my granddaughter to wear to the Nutcracker ballet this Christmas, and overall, I’m quite pleased with it. The color is absolutely beautiful, and the sequins on the top add a lovely touch of sparkle. The tulle netting on the bottom gives the dress a magical, ballet-ready look.  However, the dress did arrive with the base quite wrinkly which the Amazon description did mention. I immediately hung it up, hoping that some of the wrinkles would naturally smooth out, but so far, it hasn’t made much difference. I’m hesitant to hand wash it before my granddaughter even has a chance to wear it.  I’m planning to try light steaming to see if that can help remove the wrinkles from the tulle. I’m hopeful that with some gentle steaming, the dress will look as perfect as I imagined for the special occasion.  Despite the wrinkling issue, the dress itself is beautiful and should make for a memorable and festive outfit.",

I think this would have worked much better for the next size up.
