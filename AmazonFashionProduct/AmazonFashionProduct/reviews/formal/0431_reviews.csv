I normally stick with natural materials, definitely in the summer, but these are ok for Polyester.  Not shiny or too thin.  The colors are good though the white is slightly more “winter white” than bright white, which actually works better for me.

Jennifer,Love this top! CAN BE WORN BOTH WAYS!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AMSVEITUN56O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D41GZSDB,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 18, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Beige,,"This is a cool top bc it looks cute both forward & backwards which I never would’ve expected when I ordered it. I love cowl necks, which this is if worn forwards, but with the drape in the back it has an unexpected sexiness to it bc you don’t expect to see any of the back when looking at the front boatneck. The shirt is also a bit more oversized than I expected which is another reason I prefer the drape in the back. This shirt is made from a thin, stretchy, ribbed material that’s breathable & feels nice against the skin. It feels like a poly blend. I ordered it in the beige color, but in person it has a very faint dusty pink tone to it. I help it against a true beige top to show the difference but it didn’t show as well in the pic as it does in person w the light on it. The length of the top looks good front tucked & untucked wo looking messy. It has drop shoulders, which I didn’t expect, & I think that adds to the oversized fit. The lightweight material drapes beautifully but isn’t very warm so I think it’d be nice for cool summer nights, warm fall days or spring. It would also work as a layer during the colder months. You really can’t beat the price at $15 so I plan on ordering more colors probably in 1 size down this time though. I’m typically a medium but sized up to a large & although I like the oversized fit, I’d like to have one slightly more fitted as well. Definitely a very cool & versatile shirt at a great price so it’s something I’d recommend to anyone looking for a cute cowl neck or draped back.",6
Serebro,Great flattering cut that can be dressed up or down,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZPI75N6ZDL3V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D41GZSDB,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 15, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Beige,,"I ordered this to replace a worn shirt in my fall wardrobe; the classic neutral color and timeless style make this a very versatile top, suitable for wearing under a blazer for a meeting, pairing with a skirt for a fall date night, or just elevating a pair of jeans a little bit. The cowl neck style also works well to ensure enough fabric to cover a larger bustline, though it does tend to make the bust look a little larger as well due to the extra fabric creating visual bulk. With the exception of the cowl neckline, this is a pretty basic long-sleeve top; the classic fit isn't too big on fit women, but remains work-appropriate for women with a small bit of tummy pudge or heavier arms.  My only complaint with this is the fabric the manufacturer chose, and that's pretty minor; it's very high polyester and has a bit of a shine to it, which can make this look less than perfectly classy in some lighting. But that also makes it a little less likely to stain from food spills at lunch, or baby spit-up if worn by a childcare teacher, keeping it looking nice longer. The mid-heavy weight is a great choice for a cool-season top, and the drapey nature of this knit makes the cowl neck look good.  Overall, at its current $15 price, it's quite a solid choice for a top for work if you're not in an environment that requires business formal, and it's comfortable enough to wear on days off as well.",2

There are no closures you just pull it on over your head. The sleeves are a good length and the cowl neck is surprisingly easy to work with. Just make sure that the hem edge is on the inside of the shirt and let it fall and it will naturally slip into folds. It’s a pretty versatile top considering the specific design. You can wear it with jeans. trousers, or skirts and you can tuck it in or not. There are no buttons or zippers - you just slip it on over your head. I think this is a pretty quality option and will serve you well throughout fall and winter. The only thing I was unsure of was the extra fabric under the arms.

It fits, but it seems like it runs a little small through the midsection and around bottom. I'm pretty busty, so I usually have a problem with tops fitting the girls and being too big around the bottom. But it's not too small for me in the bust and arms, so I guess it's just made to be a bit more fitted than I expected from the pictures of it on the model. You may want to go up a size if you don't want a snug fit in the body. The fabric was kind of ""crunchy"" when I first tried it on, but it softened up after washing and hanging it to dry. But it IS definitely more suitible for cooler weather because the fabric isn't very breathable, so I think it would be itchy and uncomfortable in warmer weather. It's also pretty thin. I got it in black and I can see through it a bit if I hold it up with any type of light source behind it. It's looked okay and nothing showed through when I tried it on with skin tone colored bra, but I think a white or brightly colored bra would show through. So have a feeling the lighter colors might be a bit see through when worn. On the plus side, it is a pretty top that I can wear with most of the bottoms in my wardrobe this fall and winter. The fabric has some stretch to it so it's comfortable to move in, and it has a slight ""silky"" sheen to it. The cowl neck drapes nicely without adding bulk, so it will work well on its own or under a cardigan or blazer. I got it to wear with a satin slip skirt to an event in October and it looks great with that, but it will also work nicely with jeans, trousers, or other types of skirts.",4
