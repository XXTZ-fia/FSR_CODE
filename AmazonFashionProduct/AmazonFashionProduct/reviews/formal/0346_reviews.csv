There is no smell of plastic.  In order to button the front I sized up as was recommended (XXL instead of XL.)The blazer is boxy, not short and IMO looks more like an outerwear piece, something you might wear over a sweatshirt. If styled with the right pieces it could work as a blazer. NOTE: the blazer is very wrinkled.  A steamer works wonders. You have to steam the inside because water beads off the pleather. I steamed with the jacket hanging and with it flat on towels on the bed. Tedious but worth it.  I purchased both black and brown. Sadly the brown just didn’t work with my coloring.",3

I ordered this in a large and it fits nicely…not as oversized, just as a normal blazer. I can’t button it closed, but the two sides come together and meet and look great as an open blazer. This faux leather isn’t too thick or too shiny like many fakes. It could use a bit more texture, but for $33-$39.00, I won’t complain. I did need to use a steamer to get the folds out, and the lapel collar would not lay flat! However, 48 hours with a chip-clip holding it down did the trick.",2

Nice fit, nice style, nice feel - extremely comfortable and does not feel 'fake' at all! Feels/looks like real leather. I am 5'3, 173lbs, and I bought an XL. The sleeves are too long, but there is a satin lining inside, and the sleeves actually look cute cuffed. My problem is the wrinkles! The coat came nicely wrapped and packed, but it was folded in a very small box, and I am unable to get the wrinkles out. The label says no dry cleaning, putting in the dryer, or ironing; hand wash only. I actually put paper weights in the pockets while it was on a hanger for a few days. No change. It's sad because i love it but can't wear it out of the house looking the way it does. Haven't decided if I'm keeping it or not.",6

The Girl Utah,Plays the part of leather jacket really well.. a faux option at a steal of a deal!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NT4XVIWTUXBF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CVVR2XHQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 4, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Jacket is a solid option.. and fun addition to the wardrobe! It creates a trendy yet, sophisticated business style.. a jacket that seamlessly can transition from office into date night or club attire! Pleasantly surprised how faux leather doesn’t scream plastic!! Jacket has a real moveability and comfortably gets more “broken in” with time similar to real leather. Wearing just x3-4 outings- it has gained a solid ‘go to’ creature comfort.  Folded creases from boxed arrival let go with hanging and acclimated warmth. No off-putting smell noted nor, that dreaded sheen of fake leather. This is a huge perk for just a fraction of the price of real leather- can easily become a closet staple and look the part.  Cut with a slight oversized look.. the online size chart is accurate. Ordering med. for: 23yr old, 5’7”, 130lb, 34B/C.. fit had comfort with enough room to wear over layers or thicker sweater. Sleeve was a bit long.. however, it seems to be part of the style. Note: it is easy to flip over and cuff the extra length if needed. Button front gave enough room to fasten and even “x-stretch scissor” arms across body without restriction (ha.. the move we all do to test for a true fit!) Expect nicely placed working pockets and interior liner to add warmth.. ha! Novel concept a jacket that does its intended job!  Overall, a fashion statement that looks sleek and trendy, while being versatile for a fraction of the cost of leather.. great closet staple! Hoping this info can help- stay safe everyone.",28

So, I'm a mid-size girlie and I like the oversized look but it has to fit just right for me to pull it off. I ordered my regular size of Large and this jacket is very oversized, to the point where it isn't really flattering. If unbuttoned it just looks too big and buttoning it creates a weird poof on my back. I'm going to play around and see if I can make it work but for nearly $60 you should look elsewhere.

It arrived carefully folded and protected by tissue paper, but being faux leather, it still wrinkled badly. Some wrinkles were so deep I was afraid the fabric was permanently damaged. After doing some online research, I cautiously approached it with a steamer. It took me about 25 minutes and half a gallon of water to make the coat look presentable, heating it with steam and then pressing wrinkles out with my fingers as the fabric cooled. Some fold marks remain, but they aren't too noticeable. The jacket went from looking like cheap plastic to something resembling leather. It's a good fake, not too shiny, but thin.  The jacket is described as a ""moto jacket,"" but it's more of a blazer-style coat. It's boxy and oversized, and despite the princess seams, it drapes rather than skimming the body. Usually, I consider this a good thing because I have some curves to hide around the waist, but I don't like how the thin fabric drapes over my chest, creating several folds. There are also more folds in the sleeves than I like.  The fit is as expected. I ordered my normal size – large – and it was oversized, as advertised. It was a bit snug in the arms but good everywhere else over a bulky sweater, and nicely oversized when worn over a tee. I can button it over a sweater, but I prefer it open. The sleeves are a little too long for me, but that's a consistent problem for me with coats.  The construction is very good. The topstitching is straight and consistent, and the buttonholes are perfect. There's an extra button included, but the ones on the coat are firmly anchored, so I don't think I'll need it. The jacket is fully lined, and there's a gusset in the upper back of the lining. The large front pockets have flaps that can be tucked in cleanly.  There was only the faintest whiff of a chemical smell when I opened the package. I imagine all the steam I used probably helped get rid of any residual odors. It's nice to know that if the coat ever needs washing, it can be hand-laundered in cold water.  I think I'll get some good use out of this jacket in spring and fall, and maybe even in some light rain showers.",25

A jacket should have a little room to wear a sweater underneath comfortably. Without a sweater, I have a little extra space in the lower back but it doesn't look oversized. It still looks good. This jacket isn't supposed to hug your curves anyway. The stitch is good and the buttons are a dark color, complementing the jacket. The two pockets are working pockets, as in they're not just for show, the flaps only, nor sewn shut. The jacket, though, arrived very wrinkled due to packaging so I carefully steamed the wrinkles most of the wrinkles out.

Came well wrapped and just hung it near the wood stove overnight and folding creases came right out. This type of jacket never goes out of style, only the items you wear with it do.
