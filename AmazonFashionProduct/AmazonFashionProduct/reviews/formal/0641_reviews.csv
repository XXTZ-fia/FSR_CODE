AH,Not my favorite,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35PIT6IDGIZWS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ2N77LR,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Size: 2XColor: Black,,"Overall, I'm not a fan if this shirt. The material isn't quite scratchy but isn't soft. It's an unpleasant sensation. The pattern in the weave is subtle in the black color. The elastic in the sleeves is very uncomfortable. And the front detail makes it look like I've got the shirt inside out because it doesn't lay flat. It's not horrible, hence 2 stars instead of 1. But it's not something I would enjoy wearing.",

It comes in several great colors to accent your spring or summer wardrobe.  The top is long enough to hide problem areas but still short enough to look trim and fitted.,

I saw this top and thought I'd give it a try.  It's just okay.  It's not the nicest shirt I've ever had nor the worst.  It's got a nice pattern but IMO it's really hard to see it in the black color that I ordered.  It seems like the pattern of the knit stands out a lot more in the other colors.  The shirt held up well in the washer and dryer.  Overall, I'm happy with it but wish I'd chosen a different color.",
Mr. Smith,Nice dressy top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3519SXZRS9Y0M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ2N77LR,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 28, 2024",Size: 3XColor: Black,,"I think this is a little more dressy. The listing says casual, but to me this would definitely be dressy. But then again my go to is T-shirt and jeans. However, I’m going to be wearing this to church. It’s a really beautiful black shirt. I got a 3X. I normally wear a 2X and I would definitely size up. I think this looks really nice with skirts. I’m really happy with the quality of it and the fit.",

Usually shirts are hit or miss for me on here. I typically wear a 3x or 26 women's tops because I don't care for clingy on my stomach. This one is perfect! The color looks as pictured.  I just might get a couple more of these tops in the different colors.,
Sabre,"Very cute and true to color, texture not great",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NEQ2OUYP9QKH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ2N77LR,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2024",Size: 3XColor: Purple,,"Size 3x fits size 22/24 plus. The color is really pretty and true to the pastel purple I picked out. The shirt looks good on and I appreciate the length, it is not too short. I have to wear a tank top with it because the material feels scratchy/itchy, even after washing. Might be a sensory nightmare for some people. I definitely recommend wearing an undershirt with it if you have sensitive skin",
Simply Sally,Scratchy itchy material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RY8LXJNP2RAJF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ2N77LR,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 17, 2024",Size: 4XColor: Rose,,"This Eytino Summer Top looks pretty cute on the website, but it falls short of that now that I've put it on. The material is scratchy and old-fashioned and old-ladyish, as is the style, really. And it's quite sheer.  I love the color and the fit. I prefer my tops to be loose-fitting and I'm in between sizes so I ordered up and it's plenty roomy. The sleeves come all the way down to my elbow so if you're looking for coverage there you'll get it.  I tend to keep things just because they fit and forgive a some of the shortcomings, but this is not a keeper for me.",2
@sarahtalksbooks on IG,Great Price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP0J51K6UBFA1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ2N77LR,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 16, 2024",Size: 4XColor: Black,,I ordered according to the size chart and it fits really well.

Dawn,Fits true to size; machine washable; itchy material.  I don't like this top.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BI00PVD3VBIN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ2N77LR,"1.0 "," the United States "," November 11, 2024",Size: 4XColor: Sky Blue,,"This 97% Polyester and 3% Elastane top has a rounded neckline with a small V-neck opening located at the front center, short sleeves with an elastic ruffle, a center front seam with plackets, and a slightly curved hemline.  It fits true to size.  To me, this material was itchy against my skin.  I didn’t like it at all.  I couldn’t get this top off me fast enough.  I don’t think washing it will help.  The material is made this way.  The short sleeves are puffy at the shoulder and give plenty of room to move around in.  They fell about an inch and a half above my elbow.  There is a front placket on the center front of this top.  I thought, when I looked at the picture, it hid buttons.  It does not.  It is simply a placket on both sides of the seam.  It serves no real purpose and looks a bit odd.  The hemline fell above the apex of my thighs.  The shirt was a bit short for my liking.  For reference, I am five feet seven inches tall.  Upon further inspection, there were no failed seams or loose, hanging threads.If worn with dress pants or a skirt, you could wear this to church or an office-type environment.  It is nice enough to be worn to a luncheon with friends, shopping, going to the movies, walking your dog, or simply hanging out at the house with your family.  It can be paired with jeans, leggings, shorts, capris, dress pants, skirts, or blazers.  Don’t forget the shoes when completing your ensemble:  sandals, flats, heels, sneakers, or flip-flops.Machine or hand wash in cold water.  Hang to dry.  Do not bleach.Personally, I would not recommend this top.  I don’t like the way it feels against my skin.  I will be donating it to the local women’s shelter so hopefully, someone else can get some wear out of it.",
Drēma,"high-quality, breathable, and lightweight",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RW0S42TDYSYS7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ2N77LR,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 11, 2024",Size: 4XColor: Khaki,,"I absolutely love this plus-size summer top! The fabric is high-quality, breathable, and lightweight, making it super comfortable to wear all day long. The puff sleeves add a feminine touch and keep me feeling cool, especially during the warmer months. The V-neck and elegant jacquard fabric give it a sophisticated feel, making it perfect for both professional settings and casual outings. I’ve worn it to work and out for dinner, and it’s a versatile piece that pairs well with jeans, skirts, or trousers. Definitely a must-have in any wardrobe for spring, summer, and even early fall!",
SChapman,cute and comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R386MABK2TEPZE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ2N77LR,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 10, 2024",Size: 4XColor: Purple,,"I usually wear a 20/22 in tops because I like them to be loose. I don't want sleeves to ride up and stick, I don't like them to be tight in the belly when I sit, and I don't like them to be too short so they don't cover the FUPA. This shirt is great. I ordered a 4X and it fits just about perfect. The sleeves have some elastic to create that cute little ruffle but it's not too tight that it makes marks on my arm. It's a little low cut for me, but I can use a modesty panel thing so I can wear it to work since I don't have the boobs to fill it out. The shirt is loose enough in the belly that it doesn't pull tight and it has a nice length. It's a nice light lavender color and has visual interest with the waves in the material. I think this shirt is a keeper. You may want to order up if you decide this one may be for you, too.",

It has a beautiful light purple and it's really versatile when it comes down to the top front of your chest having enough Air and Space, I'm top heavy and I love to make sure I can feel good around my arm area as well as my chest area and it's free flowing which is nice and you can tell that it's made with good quality materials just from even looking at it for the most part, not to mention putting it on. I would love to get this and different color variations and I definitely am enjoying the style, I can find a way to wear this year around because it's just that quality of a blouse and shirt put together. Thank you so very much! 🤗",
Bird Reviews,Super cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FH1BFR31QVKZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ2N77LR,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 8, 2024",Size: 1XColor: Khaki,,"When I took this shirt out of the bag I didn't think I was going to like it. I thought it wasn't going to look like the photos I saw online. But when I put it on, it looked just like the pictures and actually was really cute. It is a great top for work, church, a meeting or any business casual event. It is comfortable. It is lightweight and honestly I like most anything made with elastane, they always hang so well and are flattering. This top comes in 7 colors, I had a hard time choosing one. It's also available in extended sizes.",

The textured, punched out material is a little itchy. Also the front vertical style piece to me looks like an inside out button panel. The puff sleeves are nice as they are not too puffy. The material quality is nice enough and looks like it will wash just fine, however this shirt will not be going into my wardrobe so it won’t make it to wash day. To each her own, but this shirt is not for me.",
