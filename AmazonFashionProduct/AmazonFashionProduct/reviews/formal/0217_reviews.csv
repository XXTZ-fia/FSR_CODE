Has a nice piece of added material under arms to cover the upper side of ribs with the loose sleeves. I did not expect it to look as blue in certain lighting, so wasn’t quite as festive as I had for Christmas, but still worked well and worked really nice for when we went to see wicked. I was debating about this one or one from Lola and the boys, and went with this one, much cheaper and was still super cute. Ran a bit big though, wish I could have gotten a smaller size",

I wasn't ready for the amount of shedding when I opened the bag though.  There were little bits of black fringe that spread all over my floor.  I would have expected some of the sequins to fall off, not a black fuzz flurry.  The dress itself is well made and the fabric does feel a little heavy, so if you are in a hotter climate I would keep that in mind.  But overall I would order similar items again, or maybe even this one to gift since it's so cute.",
