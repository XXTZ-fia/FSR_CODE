We ordered 3 of the same dress for flower girls. Simply trying on after receiving 2 straps completely came off, others were barely hanging on by frayed threads. Fabric frays terribly,  had to sew on 2 straps and reinforce the other 4. The clear slide buckles for adjusting straps do not stay; they are noticeably to wide and needed tacked down to stop from sliding. Other than the strap problem, happy with the dresses. Make sure you have someone who can sew!!!",2
