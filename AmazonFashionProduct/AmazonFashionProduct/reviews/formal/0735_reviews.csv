But you could get a better tailored garment anywhere else. This was fairly disappointing. I was able to put a petticoat underneath it, but it just still didn’t look quite right and that was primarily due to the cheap material and the fact that it runs so small that it was laughable. Waist is supposed to be at natural waist. I don’t have a long torso even for a tall person and there was maybe 3-4” of space between my natural waist and the waist of the dress. The bottom of the arm holes hit my armpits and the breast piece that met the mesh on top was far too high. Just a good 3-4” of material missing from this dress to at least look like it was made to fit correctly. I could barely breath in it and I was wearing sharewear.  The cherry on top was that the breast scarring was off to where it should have been and the stitching was coming out so there was a hole in it right out of the box. Could have taken it out a bit if there was more seaming material, but would have been a waste of time.  Returning.",9

If they made an XS it probably would have worked. The comments about quality are certainly true, but it looks good from far away so that may not be a dealbreaker. The details on the embroidery were super cute, but a lot of them had long, loose threads which I don’t think is acceptable for a nearly $50 dress. The other reviews were correct that the fabric is not hemmed and would likely come apart if someone looked at it too hard. I didn’t have much trouble with the zipper. The inner layer is weird and thin, but I could have overlooked that if it weren’t for the fit. Overall, adorable dress but I felt very meh about the price to quality ratio.",4

When I received it I could immediately see several issues with the dress quality. The embroidery was coming undone in several places, and there were loose threads all over the place. The embroidery was very sparse and there was a random butterfly stitched onto the neckline for whatever reason. All the edges were very ragged and even had chunks of cut up tulle hanging off of the hem.  All of that aside I still tried the dress on with hopes of fixing the other issues but to my surprise the tulle was sewed into the zipper not allowing it to unzip completely. I returned it the very next day. I know ordering clothing off of Amazon is always a gamble but I was shocked at just how terrible the quality was after seeing so many great reviews.",
