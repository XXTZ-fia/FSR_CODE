The skirt is a layered satin of the same material as the bodice!  This is a very comfortable dress! The sleeves are capped though I would like for them to have been longer.  This is an excellent 'Spring and Summer' dress! I do like this dress quite a bit! I do recommend this dress! This seller has 8 colors to chose from and 5 sizes! The price is acceptable for the quality and longevity!",

Jimmie Mack,Great long Midi dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JPGH5V0C76TR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKDVR6FT,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Color: NavySize: Medium,,"The floral design is made on the print of the fabric and sets the material off.  The dress is well made with the neat stitching of no loose threads, puckers or snags.  The top is smocked and well done.  The shirt part is lined so not see through.  There is a button on the back for closure and an extra button is provided.  Most of the Pretty Garden clothing I have has a quality to them for reasonable price.  This one is a good piece for church or casual wear.  I will need to hem or wear with heels because it is long.  The dress is 100% polyester and machine washed and dried with no problems.  The manufacturer size chart was accurate for me.  Well done.",
Katie,Not for large chested ladies,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ELI7LAJ48XL4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKDVR6FT,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,I got this dress bc it is modest but still cute. I really liked the skirt (especially since it has pockets). It was nice and flowy BUT the bodice is not long enough for large chested girlies. I felt frumpy and awkward. The bodice also felt to large at the same time bc it didn't cinch anything. I really wanted to like this but I'll have to return it.,
Cliente frecuente,This dress is ok,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C8340R2UNF8Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKDVR6FT,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Color: Dark GreenSize: Medium,,"This dress is ok. I thought it was going to be a bit more elegant, but the style looks kind of old. It is still ok, the color is beautiful and the fabric is soft. Overall I would give it a 4.",
Timothy Greene,Very Form Fitting,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T35262U8JC6O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKDVR6FT,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Color: BeigeSize: Large,,"My wife tried on this dress and likes it very much. Ii is very form fitting above the waist and shows off all the curves in the right places. Below the waste there is an inner slip material underneath so that the dress is not transparent. It is very elegant looking and could be worn for summer dining in a nice restaurant or a party. The length is just above the ankle on my wife who is 5'6"". She got the beige color which is very nice. The material seems like a linen finish with pleated layers and slightly ruffled sleeves. Very attractive dress for the price.",

It’s a perfect casual mom meet up dress or can easily be dressed up for something fun. The cute and folder of the dress helps the mommy tummy and would blow up in the wind. The sleeve help add cute flare to it. The length goes down to my mid calf. A small fits me well I’m able 125,

ERC,Interestingly pretty,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3996K5ZOR5YFG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKDVR6FT,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 3, 2025",Color: Wine RedSize: X-Large,,"At first glance the material of this dress kind of looks like curtains or doilies. After putting the dress on, it is very pretty and flattering. It does a good job at hiding your waist, but doesn’t look frumpy. You feel very pretty when wearing it. The material is thin enough to wear during the summer, but thick enough, you do not need to worry about it being see-through. This dress could be worn on many occasions. This is great to have in your closet.",
