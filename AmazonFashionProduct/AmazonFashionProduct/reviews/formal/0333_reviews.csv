It’s cut straighter so it doesn’t look huge. I’d recommend 100% and I’m very picky. Packs well in a suitcase annd no wrinkles. Length is annkle length for me and I’m 5’7. Neckline not to low. Only drawback is how the material is attracted to lint. Be careful of any wrap or coat you wear over it as the fibers can stick to the dress. Just have a lint roller in hand.,

Very happy with the length & the fit. The opening in front is secured in just the right place. I wear a size 6 dress so I got a small & the fit is perfect. I have broader shoulders which sometimes puts me in a medium. Glad I did a small the medium would have been too big in the waist. The fabric is thicker so the dress lays & flows nicely. The length is perfect. I'm 5'6  I wore tall boots the hem hit just above my ankle bone. This is a dupe of the Anthro Somerset velvet Maxi but they didn't have the orange color. Lots of compliments.,

Short sleeves are a flutter style that is very feminine.  I paired it with a modern print shawl/pashmina type on a cooler day.  Got several compliments.  I bought a few more in different colors because good velvet/velour dresses aren't offered all the time in fashion cycles.  Would also look fun dressed down with a pair of boots and the right accessories.  Bought size L (US 12-14 is what I normally wear).  Am 5' 8"".",

After reading reviews and details I decided on a medium as it's a pull over. I am 5'4 150lbs. It is too big. I should have gone with a small but typically I am more M/L. The cut makes it lay where it would cover more of the midsection if that's a problem area . The material is very heavy and I think adds to it feeling too big. There is lots of stretch. Quality looks nice. I did order dark green and it's almost black. Not as green as the picture but I think that really depends on the lighting as well given it's velvet. A conservative look but think it can be made sexy with the right accessories. For the price I would recommend and order again.,3
