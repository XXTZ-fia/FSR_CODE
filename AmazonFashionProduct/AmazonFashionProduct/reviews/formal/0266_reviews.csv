Ruslan Norovyatkin,beautiful and delicate!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YXLL0G6QAVF1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKXJHCZL,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Size: 10-11 YearsColor: A Purple,,"This cute chiffon dress is perfect for summer events or casual wear. The purple color is vibrant and appealing for young girls, and the lightweight chiffon fabric makes it comfortable for warmer weather. The dress is well-made with attention to detail, and the flowy skirt adds a playful touch. It fits true to size, but since it is a chiffon material, it’s a bit delicate, so it may need careful washing. Overall, it’s a lovely choice for a summer dress.",

Amazon clothes are hit or miss, but this was definitely a hit. I ordered the green for my oldest daughter, and it was so cute that I ended up ordering the dusty pink for my youngest. My pictures don't do the green justice. The green in person looks just like it's pictured on this seller's page. The dress fits great, and it's super flattering on both of my girls. The material is light and airy, and it comes with a second layer so it isn't see-through. I ordered them because I thought they would be so cute as Easter dresses, and I'm embarrassed to say I ordered Easter dresses in December, but I couldn't pass them up. They'll definitely work as everyday dresses too, but Easter is what crossed my mind when I saw them.",

Its cute, the picture mockup in the listing makes it look cute, but something about it is a little messy and frumpy. I think its the fuzzy polkadots. Its a little big for my 6 year old but its the same pink color as all the other dusty pink blibean dresses i buy. Its light and soft material, it seems comfortable, its much nicer than their solid polyester dresses so that's a big plus that the material is better quality. It'll be fine for spring but its not going to be the first dress I grab out of the closet. The fuzzy dots were a strange design decision and the dress would be a 10 star without them.",
SpeakingTruths,Nice dress.  Which side is the front?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8XKEP79N7MMD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKXJHCZL,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 25, 2024",Size: 6-7 YearsColor: A Sky Blue,,"This is a nice dress that is sized appropriately.  Our daughter is 6 years old but looks like a full 7 year old and we got the 6-7 year old size.  Fits her perfectly.  The fabric is strong and hefty; doesn't feel too light.  There are no tags on the dress that we received so we don't know which is the front and which is the back and they look so similar, I'm not sure if it's just fully reversible, but it'd be nice to have something showing us which side is supposed to be the back of the dress.",

It is very comfortable and well made. It's nice enough to wear to nice places or casual enough to wear to a BBQ.  This little dress is so cute on my little one! The fit of the dress is great, stretchy in the torso so it will fit your kids as they grow. The material is a very light cotton on the outside with a polyester slip on the inside. It is very comfortable and fits very well. The dress is nice enough that you can easily wear it to church but casual enough that you could wear it out for a day trip or to a summer party/BBQ. The length is below the knee on my LO but I suspect we're in for a growth spurt soon and will probably be close to knee high.",
