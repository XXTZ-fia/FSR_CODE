Didi,It’s OK,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34LP82CBFE7Y3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CW39M97S,"3.0 "," the United States "," February 3, 2025",Size: 8Color: Mint Green,Verified Purchase,I bought this dress to wear for a wedding. It is a good thing. I know how to sew. It comes with sewn in foam bras that do not fit properly into the darts. I had to cut those out. I ordered a medium and it is considerably big on my shoulders. I have taken darts in the back to take that up. It also is a wrap and I’ve had to sew up the front. It is still too low. I will be buying some lace to put in the V where I have sewn the overlaps together. Would I buy it again? Probably not.,

For wrinkles, steaming worked amazingly well and kept it wrinkle-free for most of the afternoon/evening.  I did reinforce the single stitch in the chest area to ensure it didn’t break or tear the fabric and helped offer a bit more support (took less than a minute to reinforce).  I’d normally wear a size 12, but ordered a size 14 based on other reviews. This was perfect for the chest area and thankfully the waist area didn’t look too baggy or loose (it was very comfortable and no worries about feeling constricted after eating).  The material was very soft and lightweight. No issues with itchiness or feeling uncomfortable at all (I have very sensitive skin and touch sense, so this was a huge plus for me). The color was gorgeous and exactly as advertised online.",14
