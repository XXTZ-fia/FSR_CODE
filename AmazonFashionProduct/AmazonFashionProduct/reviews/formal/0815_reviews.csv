Amazon even warns that this particular item has a more-than-usual return rate.  I am keeping mine.  First is the material.  Polyester/Spandex could mean almost any thing; it is not Italian wool and I did not expect it to look like it was.  I have no idea how the material will hold up.  The size and styling is called slim fit which means it is not made for most American men.  I take a size 2 -- I am too short, too fat, too old.  Nothing off the rack is gonna fit me.  For pants I need a 40 inch waist and a 24 inch inseam.  I have a small chest with a big pot belly. I buy dress shirts at Macy's and expect to double the price when I add in the tailoring needed. This jacket was priced at about the same as a good weight pair of 501 jeans.  I was not expecting bespoke fit or construction.  The next up is the design.  It is called 'a blazer' .  For me that means patch pockets and contrasting metal buttons.  This jacket has neither.  The three sleeve buttons had sparse button hole stitching.  It was so fake that when I had the sleeves shortened, I had similar decorative stitching added to continue the joke.  It does not have the typical fake stitched button hole on the lapel that is convenient for wearing decorative or identifying pins. The pockets are slit with flaps.  It may not be clear from the pictures, but there are two inner pockets and the jacket is fully lined.  Yes it is very light weight.  But now, even in the heart of winter, I rarely will be wanting to wear my real bespoke Shetland Wool tweed sport coat.  Everywhere is heated much warmer now.  Also, it has center vent, not mentioned.  That is important for me because the usual side vents show off my big butt.I wanted a light weight jacket that looked better than a zippered hoody, for casual wear -- unbuttoned -- year round.  I think this will do me just fine.",

They were accurate. First the color was incorrect. I order a dark grey and received a very light grey jacket. Second issues was the sizing, in particular the sleeve length. I am 5'8 and 175 and the large size was a pretty good fit, except for the sleeves. They were at least 3 to 4 inches too long. Third was packaging. If you fold up a suit coat and shove it into an envelope it is going to get wrinkled. Some of the creases seemed to be pressed into the suit and not in the right place, such as sharp creases down from front of the coat. I tried ironing them, but some creases just refused to come out. Lastly, quality. This is a very lightweight jacket. I expected as much, but the construction and sewing was not careful. Sleeves were misaligned and the seams just did not fit together properly which left pucks and gathers. All in all, a disappointment.",
