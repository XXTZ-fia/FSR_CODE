Jami McCain,So beautiful!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10E27NXJGZCNQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4HPPKNJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Navy,Verified Purchase,I really liked this dress!

Natalie,Get the sparkles for extra glam!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JQJWZNDR1WYM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4HPPKNJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Sequin Navy,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this dress for a Gala & I am so pleased with the quality and price. The cut is ultra flattering. I purchased a size medium for my pear shaped 155 lb body. The fabric is stretch and very forgiving. I ordered two of these because I thought the sparkles could be cheap looking, but they are actually gorgeous and make the dress look much fancier. The cut is classy and perfect for a winter event. I also ordered the all black and it seemed a little plain after having the pretty sparkles on the navy.  (I purchased 5 other dresses from Amazon and this one is the winner. )",

Flattering fit around the tummy area. Long sleeves were mesh so I was able to stay warm while still getting some airflow.  Dislikes: the off the shoulder area kept coming up and I had to adjust the shoulders just about every 2 min. I probably won’t wear the dress again but it was pretty in pictures and comfortable.",

I would have given it 5 stars but the downside to it was that the off shoulder kept trying to push up onto my shoulders. I felt like I spent a good deal of the night readjusting it. The fit however was exceptional. It clung to my curves in a flattering way while still giving a slimming effect. The length was great not too long or too short could be worn with heels or flats. The material was stretchy but not see through and black is always a classic look.,

After trying it on I did not feel that it was a great option or worth the hype. The sparkle of the fabric was nice and it did fit true to size. However, I was annoyed that the fold-over part kept rolling up and I had to constantly adjust it. I did not end up wearing it for NYE due to how much adjusting it required just trying it on and returned it as I did not feel it was a quality item worth keeping!",2
Danisha Martin,Looks better on your body than on the hanger…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMIMXQTMW23MJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4HPPKNJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Sequin Brown,Verified Purchase,"Great dress! When I took the garment out of the package I was initially concerned because the material appeared more like a dance costume than a dress. Once I put it on I was very pleased with the fit, the movement, and the overall look. I felt elegant at the winter wedding I attended and received lots of compliments. The stretchiness is great and it’s lined well, however I opted to wear shaping undergarments for a smoother and sleeker hourglass look. The color is rich… but the sparkles do rub onto whatever you come in contact with (a little). Also the neckline is elegant, but I had to adjust the garment back down off my shoulders several times because when you raise your arms to eat, drink, hug someone etc… the shoulders slide up. Overall, great value for the money. I ordered a small (4’11”, 143lbs)",8
Lily,Lovely off the shoulder maxi dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SGLAOAMICSLM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4HPPKNJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Black Floral,,"When I came across this dress I instantly loved the dark and moody navy printed fabric which was a nice change to all the light and bright colors I see so often. The print of the dress actually reminded me of a moody dark sky at night with clouds in it. I received the dress and tried it on and I’m very happy with it. It has a long maxi dress style and could be worn to a formal wedding or event. I think this dress could probably be worn year round or at least in 3 seasons. It is made of a mesh- like fabric that is semi- sheer, but the dress is fully lined except at the sleeves. Speaking of sleeves- when I wore the dress off the shoulder as it is intended to be worn, the sleeves were quite a bit too long. It didn’t really bother me and I have no problem wearing it like that but you might end up having to get the sleeves altered shorter. 🤣 Other than that, the dress basically ran true to size.  One annoyance is that the off the shoulder detail at the top has to be folded over and worn off the shoulder. It is annoying because it doesn’t really want to stay in place or stay like that. I do think if I can’t sew it in place I may end up adjusting it and fixing the off the shoulder detail the entire night. The dress is so gorgeous and unique though that I don’t mind figuring out a way to make it work! I can see myself wearing this dress with strappy heels and a clutch purse to the next formal wedding I attend. This is a really unique and special dress that can be worn for years to come. It is the perfect combination of fashion- forward, unique, and stylish. You’ll stand out at any wedding you attend wearing this- without looking overexposed or like you’re trying to steal the show. Gorgeous dress, beautiful fabric, nice cut- 5 stars!",

This one, in particular, stood out to her because of the off-shoulder design, which gives it a beautiful, elegant touch. She has been wearing it to church and also to the office. I always love to pamper her with thoughtful gifts, and she truly adores this dress! The bodycon fit accentuates her figure perfectly, while the long sleeves make it a great choice for various occasions. The black floral pattern adds sophistication, and the fabric feels comfortable and breathable. If you're looking for a versatile, chic dress that can be worn for both formal and casual events, this one is definitely worth considering. Highly recommend!",

The fabric stretches so well and shows off your figure. The long mesh sleeves with interesting cuffs adds elegance to this bodycon dress. The fit was nice and fabric was fine, the only con I had was mentioned by some other reviewers already. The sexy off shoulder ruched folding-over portion was really a fold-over piece of fabric, so it just kept rolling and rides-up, never stayed in place for more than a few seconds.  I don't have huge breasts. I think I need to sew it in a few discreet locations to keep the piece in place. Or, get matching colored magnetic pins in combination with a pretty brooch to hold it in place. But I shouldn't have to go through all this, with this price tag, so I'm knocking off a star.",

Very good quality, light, no see through, not going to wrinkle. You can have your shoulders open as much as on the model, or you can have it more up as on my pictures. The only con- If you pull it more down to show more shoulder, don’t raise your hands up, cause it’ll slide up. Still looks good though. I ordered size S. I’m 5’2’’ tall, 138lb. The length is perfect for me. I can wear it with flats if I want. I also had no bra on, and you cannot really tell. I would highly recommend this dress!",4

It arrived quickly and in good condition and when I tried it on I thought I made the right decision. XS fits great, not too tight, not too long. Material is nice and thick, yet has a flowy texture. Its color is as it looks on the screen, so I am really pleased. The sleeves are semitransparent and very flattering. The rushed part has the same material with sleeves. The only downside is that the rushed part, which is rolled over the shoulders, keeps riding up. So, it may cause some annoyance at an event where you wouldn't want to keep arranging your shoulders. I am thinking about using fabric tape to keep it in place but haven't had the chance to do it. But still a five star for me!",2

Learned a valuable lesson here.",

The mesh arms are a bit long, so if you're shorter you may have some bunching, or you can try to stuff the extra fabric into the off-shoulder mesh. That said it's soft and has a barely there feel, not scratchy or bothersome.  The sizing seems about right on, and there's enough give in the material to accommodate different body types.  I would like it if there was a little bit more mesh for the chest/off shoulder area. As it is, it's just loose, so you may find yourself readjusting a bit throughout an evening.  The only thing I didn't care for honestly is there is no apparent front or back to this dress. It's like a double-sided tube. The front and back seem interchangeable which I guess is ok, but it also means there is no real shaping to this dress. It doesn't seem to cause an issue but if you're hoping for a more tailored fit, this won't be it.",
