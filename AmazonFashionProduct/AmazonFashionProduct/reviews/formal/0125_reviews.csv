LBrowny,Why did it smell like burning plastic when I ironed it?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R237A5GNQTDDE4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DT49HGMM,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Color: Dark BrownSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"If you’re looking for a decent suit in a pinch, fear not, this will work. My husband looked like a g*d da*m stallion in it. BUT it did smell like burning plastic when ironed it on very low heat on the synthetic setting. It also started to tear in the butt by the end of the night. Imagine if my husband did a split on the dance floor…which he normally does at the office holiday party?!?! While the suit LOOKS nice and fits quite well, it won’t last. Which is unfortunate. Like mama always says, ya get whatcha pay for sweeties!!",

JLJ,"Decent fit. Cheap material, careless stitching",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P3RHSNA1B0NG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DT49HGMM,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 17, 2024",Color: Navy BlueSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"The fit is pretty good. Weirdly pointy shoulders, but most of these cheap Chinese suits are like that. Tried four before settling on this one.  It's very rayon, so be prepared to do a lot of steaming and pressing to keep it from looking like a wadded up napkin.  But it is comfortable, and looks nice. My big complaint is that they were very careless in stitching the fake pocket square in (as well as closing up all the pockets). Upon removing it, it pulled out all of the breast pocket lining stitching, so I'll have to sew that up again. But at least it's not visible from the outside.  The blue suit also looks VERY purple if you stand under blue light. Keep it in mind if you're looking at this as a stage costume like I was. The color will absolutely shift under different lighting conditions.  Not bad for the price, but you do get what you pay for.",
Iseeblue,Fantastic suit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3Q8JUYS0X6BYD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DT49HGMM,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 9, 2024",Color: GreenSize: 3X-Large,Verified Purchase,My husband got this to be a vintage Irish Santa on our cruise next week. The color is deeper and more vibrant in person. It looks amazing on him!!! I love it. It’s a great fit that hugs his body perfectly. I like the feel of it and I think for a 3 piece it’s worth it.,4
