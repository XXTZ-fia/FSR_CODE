I received so many compliments. It’s sexy, fit well by accentuating your body and the material feels nice!  I will say when it arrived it was a little wrinkled (probably just because it was folded in the delivery bag) but I de-wrinkled on low heat in the dryer and it was perfect. I wore a strapless bra but with the back being a little low, it may show some. I’d recommend to wear a pasty bra of some kind so you don’t have to worry about your bra band or bra strap showing. Id also say, you don’t really need shape wear since the middle area of the dress has ruching to help hide your belly. If you are very front heavy and maybe have a large apron belly, then I’d wear one! If not, I think you’ll be fine without one.  I’m 5’9 and 159 lbs, 34DD and I got this in a size medium and I got this in red. It was perfect!
