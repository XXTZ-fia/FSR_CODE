I got it as a potential interview outfit, but I didn't love the look on me even though it fit well. The fabric is somewhat thin, which is nice since it isn't stiff, but it also seems on the thin side for a structured outfit like this. The style is kind of a throwback to the 90s, but the fabric would have been much more substantial at the time (I know because I was there!).

I'm typically not a fan of wide or flare legs. With this suit, I thought I might need to make a dressy short set. BUT, no need!

For me the color was too dark but it's anyway beautiful. I'm 5' 5"" and 130 pounds. The height was too short for me. I would prefer it to be at least 1-2 inches longer. And S size was only comfortable standing. Sitting it made my stomach feel uncomfortable.  And I think if I bought M size, the jacket would be too big.",2

MommaBear702,Beautiful! Quality! True to size!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R118K0NQMYM16G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHYGXGP6,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 27, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Sky Blue,,"The color of this outfit is as great as the quality fabric it is made from! Putting this on makes you feel like the boss you are inside, outside! The pants are a bit long, so if you are short like me, I recommend getting some shoes that lift you a bit, or getting it tailored to fit your height. It is a 2 piece - just the jacket and pants! So be sure to purchase something to go underneath the jacket unless you already posses a top that compliments it. I was truly impressed! It is made out of heavier, thicker, quality fabric making you feel like you are in an expensive suit. Also it comes true to size . I am a medium, and it fit well!",2
LaCast,Business casual and cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13N3AIOJ237TC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHYGXGP6,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 23, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Navy,,This set was ordered in the small navy blue. The jacket fits perfectly not being too large while also leaving a loose feel to it. The pants fit well not having a lot of sagging in the front nor back. They are a loose fit pair of pants but they are put together well enough to leave you looking classy for a presentation or speakers conference. The quality of it is nicely made. It doesn't look high end but it also doesn't look very cheap. I would order another set.,5
