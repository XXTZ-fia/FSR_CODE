The length hits me 4-5 inches above my ankle. I was hoping it would be a little longer but it's hard to tell given the varying lengths pictured on the models.  I bought it for a winter wedding and it feels a little bit too casual, but if I don't wear it to that I'll definitely find another use for it - it'd be great to wear out to a big dinner because it's so stretchy. If you are someone that's into jewelry/accessories (I'm not) I think you could definitely dress it up more, or if you are shorter and get that extra length it could be more formal.",
