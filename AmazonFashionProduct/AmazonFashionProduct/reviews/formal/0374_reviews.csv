But this was a win!  It has the feel and comfort of a quality sweatshirt, but the style and class of a nice sweater. The red was true Christmas red, and I wore it to an expensive, trendy restaurant Christmas party. Add a piece of nice jewelry and it looked very classy with my black skirt. I had several compliments!I did have to steam it for quite a while to get the initial wrinkles out. It comes in a shrink wrapped bag and that’s why I took off a star. Clothing that comes this way makes it feel cheap. But once I put it on, it didn’t feel cheap. It appears just like the photo, free flowing but not at all thin. It’s thick enough it doesn’t wrinkle with a seatbelt, or riding in a car. The tail keeps its shape, doesn’t fold and look silly.  I’m tall, and I do wish it was a bit longer, but I took care of that with a light, longer shawl. I usually look for tunics that are 34-36”.  I haven’t measured but I’d guess this to be 33”. It was slightly shorter than most my tunics, but the free flow design made it comfortable enough get past that.",
