The quality was phenomenal, the price was ridiculously cheap! Who knew you could get such a nice quality piece on Amazon for under 150 bucks. Renting A tux at a local store was double the price, and I'm not even kidding… The quality of this tux was impeccable. The material was nice and thick, very soft and smooth, and the delivery was incredible. It came double boxed on a hanger, nice and pressed, ready to wear out of the box. It was so good, I wish I needed another one!",4

We have weddings starting in late April. Then this suit is great for our Holiday parties.",
