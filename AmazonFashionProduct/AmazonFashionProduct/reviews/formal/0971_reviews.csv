It has a zipper for the back, but again it's big enough that I was able to just slip it on over my head.  I've put it on twice now and both times I forgot it had a zipper because it wasn't a problem.  Oops!This dress is a great way to fancy up your holiday looks without breaking the bank.",11

The material is a little on the heavier side but that's to be expected but it's not too heavy. The zipper is a bit stiff. I had to have my husband zip it up because I could reach it but it was too stiff to pull up. My advice is to go with your regular size. I am 5'2"" 120 lbs. and according to their sizing chart I would fit a L so that is what I got. It is a little baggy so I could have ordered my normal size of M.",3

Dianna,Pretty with a vibrant Christmas red and a nice fit.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVK4GJJVYTAJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDT2HM2B,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 31, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Red,,"I ordered this dress because it is the perfect red for a Christmas party and it's as pretty in person as it is in the listing. Out of the box the dress is heavier than most, which is expected since it's velvet but wears beautifully. I love the way the sleeves and skirt flow with me as I walk. The dress is a little long for me which is not a surprise. I'm 4'10"" and 185 lbs. I typically wear a XL or 2XL. I ordered the 2XL and the fit is good. I like the way it looks. I was a little disappointed that the sequins are spaced apart and don't completely fill the bodice. It's more of a close-set polka dot rather than fully sequined like it appears in the listing. Someone would have to be pretty close to notice it though. The bodice is fully lined and the zipper pulls smoothly although it's not really needed. I can easily fit my head through the opening. The seams are all complete with no loose or hanging strings. The overall quality is good but the dress lacks the finishing touches that you find with the higher name brands. The cost is apropriate for the quality and fit.",3

The fabric has a slight stretch, making it incredibly comfortable and easy to move in, even during longer events. The combination of velvet and sequins adds a touch of luxury that makes me feel glamorous, yet it's still soft and cozy for fall and winter gatherings. The empire waist and A-line silhouette are very flattering, and the butterfly sleeves add a unique and beautiful touch. I wore it to a recent event and received so many compliments. This dress is a perfect choice for holiday parties, weddings, or any formal occasion. Highly recommend!",

The zipper functions smoothly, gliding up and down without any snagging. Nice, stretchy material. Although the sequins on the upper part of the dress are a bit larger than I would have preferred, it doesn’t detract anything from the look. Overall, I really like this dress; it strikes a nice balance between style, comfort, and functionality. Recommend!",
