I washes, dried and hung this one with no change. I have a lot of hope for a few more washings that should rid me of wrinkles. The blouse is great looking with a true fit. Soft and comfortable with great length in the sleeves as well as attractive over sized cuffs. Nice enough for gens or concert wear onstage. An all around good addition to the closet.",5

I found this just a tad tight across the chest. A larger size would have been far more comfortable.  Anyway, this is a decently assembled dress/casual shirt. Would look nice with dress pants and a blazer or as a uniform shirt, but it also goes will with jeans and khakis.  Classic look that won't go out of style.",

Things I like about this shirt: -- The purple color is gorgeous. -- The lantern sleeves aren't crazy poofy. -- I didn't see any sloppy seams or threads sticking out.  Things I don't like about this shirt: -- The buttons gap open across the chest, even when I just put my hands on my hips. I would have to wear this with the first few buttons undone but then that exposes too much cleavage. I'd have to wear something under this shirt and that sucks. -- The fabric is mostly comfortable enough to rest against my sensitive skin but it's not the greatest for me. The feel of the fabric is probably soft enough for most people though. My skin is just wacky. -- Something about the cut isn't very flattering on me but I can't figure out what it is. When I'm wearing this, it just doesn't make me feel more attractive.  So, overall, it's a nice-looking shirt and seems to be made well enough, it just doesn't fully vibe with me for some reason and the chest gapping thing is a major nuisance.",3

As with any piece of clothing that you order online without seeing it in person, there are always slight issues when the piece arrives.  This one has a couple of slight fitting issues but nothing that makes it unwearable.  Overall, its fairly comfortable and looks really nice.  My wife has worn it a couple of times and after washing we don't see any problems so that's a good thing. Time will tell how well it stands up and if something happens, we will be sure to come back and update the review.  As of now, we have no problem recommending the shirt to anyone looking at it right now.",2

Fabric has a nice satiny sheen. Item fits true to size. I chose a beige color, as I needed a neutral color that would match well with a variety of slacks/skirts. This is really a very nice, classic blouse. It works well for business environments and church events where something conservative is the best choice. Could be dressed up for a nice dinner or dressed down with jeans for a casual but still stylish look. Great item and I anticipate getting a lot of wear out of it! Extremely pleased with this.",2

If not, it's a little on the boxy side and the hem is straight, not curved, so it's not a good look untucked.  The arms are generous so if you have larger upper arms that you have trouble fitting, this is a GREAT choice. It's very plus-size friendly in the arms. I'm short and the double placket on the cuff makes it easy to turn back so it doesn't look too much like I'm a child wearing a grownup shirt (especially since the cut is obviously intended to be looser in the arms).  The fabric is good. It's nice and soft, not like some of the satiny things that can feel like sandpaper on the inside. It's not going to be mistaken for silk. Too shiny. But it's not a cheap-looking fabric, either. It's well made at least to the extent that I can't see any red flags like crooked seams or gaps or thread gnarls dangling.  This would look EXTRA good with a vest because of the nifty sleeves.  At the price, I absolutely do recommend this, especially for the folks with hard to fit arms.",3
