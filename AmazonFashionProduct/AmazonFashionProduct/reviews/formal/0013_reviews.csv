I also could not have been more surprised with the amount of compliments I received at the weddng reception I attended.  People stopped me even in the restroom to tell me how pretty my outfit was.  It fit well and was very comfortable to wear.  There was no issue with the lace being scratchy and many really liked the ""sparkle"" and I also was happy with the higher straight across front on the shell. This outfit needed no jewelry and I am considering buying this in another shade. Backstory is that I shopped for weeks to find something for the event and it was  literally a last minute decision when I decided to take a chance and order this outfit. Fit and pant length was perfect so alterations were not needed.Note that the pant width is a little wider than I prefer but after taking it to the dry cleaner to be pressed they were fine. Interesting to note that outfits I have purchased or had made at a sigificantly higher cost had not received the amount of compliments that this one did.",
