If I could wear this dress I would definitely wear a camisole or full slip of the same color underneath. Just necessary IMO __The style is pretty and feminine with a ruffly flowing hemline __All seams are well sewn and I found no faults to the workmanship __BOTTOM LINE: I would not choose this dress again but am not taking away any stars because it is clearly stated in the listing about all of the measurement details including the length per size, so it was my fault for not paying close enough attention.

Dawn Stone,Decent dress overall,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JZN52G8O7UBQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8B7Y38N,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 10, 2024",Color: BlackSize: 4X-Large Plus,,"This dress is actually pretty nice, but I think it could use a few tweaks to make it even better. First off, it's got a bit of weight to it that I wasn't expecting—it could definitely be lighter in my opinion. The fabric feels durable, which is great, but it doesn't have much give. A little more stretch would go a long way; even though it fits well, no woman wants to worry about pulling or tight seams when they sit or move around. The tie at the waist does help define the shape, but it would be more flattering with a bit more flexibility in the material.  The front chest area could also use a small button or snap to help close the neckline a bit better. It tends to gape open, and unless you're okay with that or plan on wearing a tank top underneath like I did, it might be a little more revealing than you’d want. The sleeves are a nice touch with the ruffle cuff, adding a bit of flair to the overall look, but again, a touch more stretch would make the whole dress feel less restrictive. Overall, it's a pretty dress with potential, just needs those small changes to make it a bit more comfortable and practical for all-day wear.",

It's not too tight as to be form-fitting, but it doesn't look baggy and unflattering either. The V-neck is a little too revealing for my taste, so I do prefer to wear a camisole underneath which can add the perfect pop of color to the whole outfit. The elastic on the sleeves is not too tight either and I love how they look with the ruffle on the end. I am not usually one who likes ruffles at all, but it's tastefully done on this dress. The length is also really nice as it comes down to mid-calf on me and is perfect for wearing to church or even work. It comes with a belt that is the same material as the dress, but you could pair any other narrow belt with it, if you wanted.",

The A-line shape flows beautifully and drapes elegantly, while the ruffle detail and maxi length add a touch of romance and freedom of movement.

SoCal Nana,Not Quite As Expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X7MEVB637TIX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8B7Y38N,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 7, 2024",Color: Emerald GreenSize: 3X-Large Plus,,"I've been wishing for a deep green dress to wear during the holiday season for more years than I can remember.  When this came up as an option I was looking forward to giving it a try.  First disappointment - the color doesn't have the dark, rich tone that I was hoping for, instead it's a bit flat of a shade.  The 100% polyester fabrication could use a touch of lycra for added comfort/stretchiness.It's also not ideal that there isn't a catch of any kind at the bodice neckline.  With a wrap design, if you don't sew on a catch, or use a decorative pin, you'd better be wearing a camisole underneath, or a very decorative bra that you don't mind flashing lacy details, because this will gape as you move.  It seems like the style of dress in which you'd like to be swept into a dance; it's ready to twirl.  Even more reason that you might want at least some modesty at the neckline.You could dress it up more easily than dressing it down, although you could wear this with a chunky boot and a vest for a more casual take.  I might add a glittery long scarf to create a striking holiday look.  the open neckline would allow for showing off a favorite necklace.The long sleeves with elasticized ruffled cuffs should mean that you can push them up if it gets too warm inside.  The dress was definitely wrinkled out of the package.  Hoping that hanging out will release some of those wrinkles.  Otherwise, steaming might be best, versus getting out an iron and possibly ruining the fabric with too much heat.  I sure wish the color of this fabric had the added depth of shade that I'd imagined from the online photos.",3

It comes with a shoe string belt and I really liked it. It does hold wrinkles so it has to be ironed. But it's very pretty on the downside. It comes in a large size but I don't feel like it was made for someone large size. And this is something I often find with plus size clothing just adding more material doesn't mean that it's going to fit certain modifications in the arms and bust area must be made for larger sizes. In my situation that was an issue the bust was too tight to pull down and get the desired look. And also the arms were far too tight to wear comfortably. I was definitely sad I had envisioned multiple styles of this like tossing on I like colored belt with matching hat and some boots but unfortunately with it not being true to size that won't work for me. So when ordering this I would definitely go up a size if you wanted to fit the way it looks on the model.,6

Long Sleeve: Ideal for cooler weather or more formal events, providing extra coverage while maintaining elegance. Ruffle Hem: Adds a touch of femininity and movement, which can be particularly eye-catching on the dance floor. Split Long Dress: The split can give the dress a more dynamic and comfortable feel, allowing for ease of movement while adding a hint of allure. Color:  Black: A classic choice that’s versatile and slimming, making it suitable for a range of events and easily accessorized.

Overall: The dress seems like it could be a great choice for a wedding or cocktail event, especially if you’re looking for something that combines sophistication with a bit of playful detail. The wrap style, long sleeves, and ruffle hem should work well for a formal occasion while still offering comfort and style.  However, since fit can vary by brand and individual body shape, it might be worth checking the specific sizing chart provided by SHESTARR to ensure the best fit.
