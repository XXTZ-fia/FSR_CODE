The jackets both fit well, with the 20 being a slightly better fit because of the longer arm length; the difference, though, was only a 1/2-3/4"".  The waist on both were acceptable because they have adjustable waists (for reference, his perfect fit khakis are from Children's Place, size 18 slim).  We kept the 20 for the jacket, although the 18 pants were the better fit.

I checked the sizing charts carefully and ordered up Since my boys are on the cusp of their sizes. This is a slim cut suit, which is great because my boys are long and slim (my eldest so much so that he has to wear suspenders with most outfits). The next size fit perfectly, and the pants have a VERY well done adjustable waist, permitting me to go down almost a full size in the waist, and meaning no suspenders were required! With the adjustable waist, I’ve no doubt that unless he grows 3” this year, we will get the entire year of wear out of the suit. Love the three pieces, it’s made more versatile.  The only weird thing was a sewn in plastic sleeve with an owners name paper that I guess you’re supposed to write a name on but why?!? I cut it out.  There was one irritating nit: they ran out of fabric or messed something up and the size 7 has white thread under the arms which is… off-putting, to say the least.  I still give it a 4.5/5 because of the overall quality, fit and design.",

It is super versatile as it comes with a pocket square, tie and vest along with the jacket, pants and shirt. The quality is fantastic and it fits very well. I think the only reason for the ‘frequently returned item’ is people may order multiple sizes and return the others. We have more events coming up and are ordering this suit again in my son’s updated size. Additional versatility if you pair this suit with a blue or cream shirt, switch out the pocket square (or not use one), wear with or without the vest…this is definitely our go to suit. My only two regrets are not finding this suit sooner to make use of all the sizes as my son grew and that this may be our last year before my son outgrows the last size available.",
