I wore it one time & washed it carefully- it should not be pilling already. I will try machine washing on gentle with a fabric softener to see if that helps at all, but the pilling will likely continue to be an issue. Sadly, I will not be buying again and cannot recommend.",

I like that it is long enough in the back to look good with skinny jeans, but you can also slightly tuck it if you like in the front. The only thing I would change, but not a big deal, is I'm not a huge fan of the wide neck for the drop shoulder style, because my bra straps tend to be seen.
