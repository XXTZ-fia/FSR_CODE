The color combinations are good, you have eight to choose from and on pictures it looks great, but in person the material is very cheap, although cotton made, it lacks density and the traditional print is just a screen print over the fabric, something you would see on a cheap shirt for example, I was hoping for stitched in instead, but that is not the case. The pants fit is fine, somewhat accurate to the sizing, but again those don't fit like true trousers but more like a sweatpants, the waist is held by elastic band and tie rope, so don't expect to use a belt. Now the other piece is small for my body type, I am 5.10'' and about 185Lbs, and that top is a little snug on me, I am only guessing that those were tailored for someone with an exceptional body structure. Sadly I won't be able to wear this suit, I was born in Rhodesia, now called Zimbabwe, and was hoping to wear it on family gatherings and traveling.",
