She's not sure she would size down necessarily, but it does fit a little larger than expected.  The material is nice and she really likes the style. Great for dressing up or for every day wear.",

MeepBeep,Love that it comes in larger sizes!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2M3MM3RW59Z3J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJHBWYXD,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 22, 2024",Size: 3X-LargeColor: Malachite Green,,"Nice long flowy sleeves. There is a bared chunk of upper arm on the sides - a fact that is not very visible in the official images, so be aware of that for dress-code considerations. Has a built-in solid-color layer for the torso and the design floats over top in the sheer fabric. Very stretchy! I'm grateful that they had a 3XL size, not many fashion brands on Amazon do!  There's very strong sewing around the slit in the arm, and all the hems too, so no need to worry about it falling apart after the first wash! My only complaint is how short the length is - the model for the official images is wearing mid-rise jeans, so, as soon as you sit down, your lower back will be exposed. So you'd need another, longer layer underneath to cover that too!",

The sleeves had a slit and I'm not usually a fan but it wasn't an open gate. It was just a nice small area. It was a little too long for me since I'm only 5'2 and the 1X felt more like a 2X. I couldn't make it work for what I needed it for.",

Has 2 layers, and the bottom layer is a bit longer which creates a neat look. Great length to cover what you need to ! But, oh my goodness, those sleeves ! They are 3/4 length (my fave). They feature sort of a point at the back of each sleeve - and if you raise your arms - definitely a 'batwing' style. (which I LOVE). But wait, there's more - the sleeves also feature a slit going down the sides - just a hello peekaboo - but adds to the uniqueness. It doesn't run the full length of the sleeve, which keeps things interesting ! Ooh, and a delicate v-neck to show off your necklaces !  One note - I washed before wearing, and used a mesh bag. I didn't want anything to get caught or cause any runs or snags. Worked like a dream. Washed and dried perfectly in the mesh bag.  Gorgeous, really unique blouse. This would be suitable for work, play, dressing up, and any other reason you can think of to wear it ! Thank you.",
Customer,"True to size, black does have the sewed ends",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R216D5ELNTHF9N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJHBWYXD,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 14, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,,Pros -Very lightweight and flowy -The sleeves do have the end sewed a notch on the black shirt -There is a soft base layer under the sheer layer so it's not see-through -Good length -Can be belted for a different look  Maybe a con -I thought it wasn't flattering on me but someone else did. Might not be a problem if you normally wear this style. I'm not taking off a star because the other person thought it looked good on me,
ShadesofGreen,A happy surprise,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ADRGEDTU41BR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJHBWYXD,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 7, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"I was a little hesitant based on other reviews, but I went for it anyway. I also ordered a large even though Amazon suggested XL. Going with the large was a good choice, it fits perfectly. I'm 38 to 40D, and the bust area fit just right. I have a shorter torso, so the back of the blouse is a little longer but it covers my butt so I'm OK with that. Had i gone for thr XL it would have been huge. The slits in the sleeves are great too- I get to let my tattoos peek through. The fabric is comfy and moves nicely when you wear it. On top of all that, my husband complimented me in it so I'd say this is a win :)",

This one is actually tunic length, going below my pockets.  Love the color. Wish I would have had this for summer though as the slits on the arms keep me having to wear jackets overtop.  But I've gotten some really nice complements on this top. So if you're wanting something longer - definitely this is the shirt.",
B.

The fit is kind of a flowing trapeze shape. There's some stretch. It's very comfortable.  The sleeves are split down the outside, for a nice detail.  Overall, it's an attractive blouse. The green is a lovely shade, on the blue side, good for a ""summer"" like me, who can't wear most greens.  The only problem I have with this blouse is the fit, as I'm petite and rather top-heavy, and this blouse is not. But the shape might be quite flattering for someone more pear-shaped.",
JulieAnn C.,Beautiful coloring and a flattering design,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPD5S35E5ZV6C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJHBWYXD,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 30, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Malachite Green,,"I’m actually really impressed with how nice this looks on! The design looks very flattering and it doesn’t cling to areas that I’m trying to hide a little bit. The coloring is very pretty and looks beautiful for Fall and Winter. The sleeves are flowy and allow a nice amount of room for arm movement and comfort. There is a little bit of snugness in the upper core area but not enough that it causes an issue or that I would want to get a larger size. I would still suggest going with your usual sizing on this.  It was easy to wash. I used cold water in my washing machine and dried it on low. The fabric came out with no problems. The fabric is light and flows very nicely when worn. The whole thing is pretty lightweight. Although, because it is two layers, it does feel a tiny bit heavier than a one layer shirt, so it does provide a little bit of warmth to it.",

I'm not a huge fan of split sleeves but these look nice as they are and would be easy enough to stitch closed if you were so inclined.  The shirt is fully lined front and back and both the inner lining and outer fabric drape well.  I think it runs a little oversized - the Medium is cut generously, a Small probably would have fit me just fine.  The way it drapes, it's not shapeless although I found wearing it with a belt or fabric tie is a better look on me.  It's a good length for a tunic, the V-neck is modest, and the color (green malachite) is beautiful.",

The v-neck opening is not too deep, and I liked how there's a darker color layer underneath the portion that covers the torso. It's a very attractive look for plus sized women.  It wears nicely, soft to the touch.  My only dislike is my fault, so I'm not dinging them on it. I dislike sleeves with slits in them, as I prefer my arms to be covered. If you are like me, you may want to skip these due to the sleeve.",

The fabric is kind of silky and doesn’t hang up in any unsightly spots. My husband said it’s a “cheerful” top.  The sleeves work well if you have larger arms because it doesn’t bind. This seems to be a summer top.  Although, it could be worn with a cardigan. I would recommend to a friend.",
