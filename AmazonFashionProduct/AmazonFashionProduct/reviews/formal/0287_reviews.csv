( For a Jr. High winter formal ) Don't waste your time with this dress if you are above 30 years old. I'm 45 and felt like I should have been wearing patent leather mary janes and pigtails.,

Michelle,Not worth $85,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCLHK4KL3Z1KQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9JFFTNP,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"Pretty, but the style of the dress doesn’t really look as advertised. The tule in the skirt makes it look like a little girls dress and not for an adult. It’s just cut weird over all",

Marcisha Ortiz,The dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R100XHXYFKDF2V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9JFFTNP,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 4, 2024",Size: 24Color: Dark Green,Verified Purchase,"I don't have the dress on hand at the moment to take a photo but photos don't do justice compared to how beautiful it is. The color green is perfect, the size fits well, this dress is worth the money. It's so comfy and honestly I was scared to buy it at first because it's been a while but it stretches so well to fit my body..... rating 10 out of 10 would buy again",3
jennifer w.,It is a gorgeous dress.....,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9TPWHT6YTAXL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9JFFTNP,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 24, 2024",Size: 20Color: Navy Blue,Verified Purchase,It is a pretty dreas and it is very flattering. But I went by the size guide and it was still pretty snug at the chest. The fabric is not heavy at all. It is just snug. It does not stretch too much so I have to return it.,
Jackie of All Trades,Neckline was low but received many compliments,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PHIOWL2NQ5B7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9JFFTNP,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 24, 2024",Size: 18Color: Burgundy,Verified Purchase,"I like the dress and bought it for a banquet. Had my mom sew in a modesty panel so I wouldn’t constantly be pulling at a cleavage line all evening. Other than that, it was beautiful and I loved it.",3
Cari,Flattering fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BMGOR2YWJQ04/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9JFFTNP,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 7, 2024",Size: 20Color: Orchid,,"I typically wear an 18/20 and the 20 fits me well, even in the bust. It's a flattering style, especially for those who are busty. I like the orchid color as it's a little bit pink, little bit mauve, and the sequins add a fun look. Even though it says to handwash it, it did survive the wash in a laundry bag.",
Rachaelthereader,Very pretty - make sure to size up!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ILZPCZ3XKX2S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9JFFTNP,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 3, 2024",Size: 20Color: Navy Blue,Verified Purchase,"I'm 5'2.5 (yes the half is important lol), 245 lbs. I normally wear a 1x shirt, size 20 jeans (22 is a bit too big but 20 is a bit too tight..), and b-cup bra. Very pear shaped! I bought this in a 2x when I normally wear like a 1x. I'm so glad I listened to the reviews and did! It fit well. The dress came down to mid-calf, the bust was a bit too big for me but that's kinda common for plus size when you have a small chest.. It was a bit too deep for the formal event I went to because of the lack of boobs but I just kinda went with it and brought a wrap to cover up when I got uncomfortable with it. The material is soft on the inside but lots of tulle on the outside. I did notice the tulle would shed some so be prepared for that. Nothing major just some bits when I would get up. Im sure if I shook it out before wearing it that would have helped. Overall the dress was nice for a cheaper formal dress though! Oh and the blue is a navy blue but not like an almost black navy, it's more of a true navy blue I would say (pic shows my husbands dark navy blue suit vs my dress) Hope this helps you!",14
Emm,Beautiful dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JJJF3BEKRWUO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9JFFTNP,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 25, 2024",Size: 22Color: Burgundy,Verified Purchase,"This dress is so pretty.  The lace shines.  The downside is the amount of material.  If you have a backside which sticks out, this dress magnifies that.",2
Kcarlson,BEAUTIFUL DRESS but added 100 lbs,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R3I67F9CAZQ4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9JFFTNP,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 10, 2024",Size: 22Color: Black,,"The dress is as seen in the advertisement. It’s gorgeous! It fit me well but because the dress is made to “boeuf” out, it adds so much weight to you that I didn’t feel as beautiful as the dress is. It has a lining, crinoline and an overskirt (where the embroidery is). I considered removing the crinoline so the overskirt would just be over the lining to reducing the boeuf and reduce how big it made me look but it was hard to see how it would look. But the overskirt is gathered quite a bit and it still made me look way heavier than I am",2
Mrs. ChaCha,Very pretty,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7H7Y9K2L3WZM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9JFFTNP,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 18, 2024",Size: 24Color: Gold,,"This is a very pretty and well-made dress. I got this for my daughter, and it mostly fits, but I will have to tighten the waist area. Overall, it is a beautiful dress and good for weddings or other formal occasions.",2
ashley,So beautiful,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QJJG3VX82PP3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9JFFTNP,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 14, 2024",Size: 18Color: Burgundy,Verified Purchase,"I got this for an event and got so many compliments on it. I'm 5' 2"" so it was a little longer than tea length which worked out. The fabric was soft and didn't itch or scratch or bother at all. I do feel like I could have gotten away with a smaller size but overall everything about it was great. I've seen other dresses from this brand and would happily purchase another dress.",4
Peggy McCauley,So pretty!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20HR1RNLWMJRS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9JFFTNP,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 10, 2024",Size: 20Color: Navy Blue,Verified Purchase,I have ordered more than 20 dresses and need to return them because they were too small.  Until this dress came today.  I got it for my granddaughters wedding. So I haven't even attended the wedding yet but when I tried this dress on I loved it.  The color and style are great.  I'm short so it  is a bit longer than midi.  I'm so glad my search is òver!,5
