Keep in mind I don’t wear my clothes tight and I just lost 40lbs so I didn’t think about the size change. A medium would be perfect. It hides my flat butt.,
Amazon Customer,Almost perfect,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3G0KUTVZ36J3R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP32TWT,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"Very cute set. The material was heavier than I expected. For the price, my expectations weren’t high so I was pleasantly surprised. I put a sheer top underneath which may have been what caused the pleating in the front, but it didn’t look bad, almost a small enhancement. The ruffles did a nice job at camouflaging my belly. The only thing I did not like is how the pants fit. I’m 5’4/170lbs, I purchased a large and the pants bunched in the crotch. I wish there was a petite option, I feel like that would fit better. Overall for the price, it’s a nice outfit.",

I ordered white to complement my Mom as a Pure, Clean, Honest, Beautiful Women. Who's Personality was like an Angel always had good intentions on everything she did. Very giving, loving. Kept her Faith in our Lord always. Helped anyone in need. Always prayed morning noon and night for others not just herself. However, when I received it! I was very Disapointed. It felt like thick spong. Was a faint pink in color. The pants went up to my neck. And the whole suit was very cheap looking. Very Flea market, looked washed. Due to light pink in color. Wrinkles and packaging was just a worn plastic bag not even folded up nicely. As if thrown into bag in a hurry.. Normally I would have a back up of some sort. But, her death came as a surprise. I had not packed much and did not have time to go shopping. For arramgements took most of my days there. Being out of town and all. Was hard enough. I had just two days to find something to wear. That really added stress to everything else. To boot when I tried to return it. They gave me a limited that had me miss the dead line date. They would not accept that the reason for being late on return. Was it was left behind at My Mother's home by accident. My sister tried to return it for me. But, Amazon did not accept the location place by her home. No compation. No one wants it even for free.. I dare not try to resale it. I can not sale something I know is not good.",12
