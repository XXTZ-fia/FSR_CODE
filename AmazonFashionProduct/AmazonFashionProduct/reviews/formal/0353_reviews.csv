I am 5', 150 lbs, apple shaped body. So needless to say this dress did not work for me.  Good: The size was right, width wise and the length was to the floor - fine. The fabric was nice, thick and silky and the print and colors were very nice (outdoor garden wedding MOB).  Not so good: It came in a very large box with lots of room, yet it was all bunched up in a little plastic bag which made the dress very wrinkled. The wrinkles came out after 24 hrs on a hanger. The neckline is very curious. It would not hang right. I think it was stitched a little off which caused an odd drape. There are buttons behind the neck which I had difficulty with, even with the dress off. No way could I button up with the dress on and I dont think my husband could do it either. The loops for the buttons were tiny, tiny. If you have an apple shaped body, this dress would make you look just like that - an apple. But you probably already know that. What was I thinking!  I do think this dress has lots of potential for other bodies.",
