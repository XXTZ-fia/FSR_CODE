While it’s flattering and stylish, it’s pretty thick but extremely hard.. he actually had scratches around the collar area and it wasn’t even buttoned all the way! The wrinkles from the packaging took forever to iron out and by the end of the day, the shirt was extremely wrinkled again. Don’t recommend this for anyone ESPECIALLY those with sensitive skin!",

The plaid collar adds a unique touch that makes it stand out from typical dress shirts. It’s also comfortable to wear, which is always a plus for long events like weddings.
