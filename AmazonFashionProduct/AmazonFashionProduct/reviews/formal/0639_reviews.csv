They are sheer without being too sheer - but if you're a woman who doesn't like showing her arms, you could wear this layered without it being too bulky.

This pretty top fit true to size and is very comfortable. The red is more like a cranberry color, not too bright and not burgundy either, it’s perfect. I washed this in the washing machine in a lingerie bag to prevent snags in the lace, it air dried on a hanger in no time and no wrinkles. The sleeves are lovely and the length is just right. Very pleased with this order and highly recommend this top.",4

The material is lightweight without looking too casual, making it versatile for work and casual wear. I've paired it with slacks for the office and with jeans for a more relaxed look around town.  The mesh fabric and v-neck design are balanced out by the built-in camisole lining and the collar cut, so I never feel exposed or inappropriate for work. The fit is true to American sizes, and although I ordered a large due to being pear-shaped, a medium would have probably fit fine. The longer side cut is also very flattering. Overall, I've been really pleased with this blouse—it's stylish, comfortable, and versatile.",

It feels almost silky yet is not related at all. I'd say great for activitys like a club or  a hot day so long as bugs are not bad as it offers almost no protection from bites.There is a sewn in  slip as well that  goes  nearly the full  lenthth and begins mid chest.Sewing looks pretty normal nothing  super or bad just run of the mill. I found no flaws with it or  lose ends.  I like the pattern and color allot and I also give it a plus for having a decent variety of choices.its very versatile nearly a dress but also a tuckable shirt.I would like the slip too be sewn in a lil more so its easyer too put back on as it  can  get inside out easily. A minor critasism.All in all I really  do like it . I think there is  good value and  it fits as expected maybey  even a tad relaxed which is nice in this style. All in all it feels great  and I  enjoy it. I can say this is a good  choice.,2
