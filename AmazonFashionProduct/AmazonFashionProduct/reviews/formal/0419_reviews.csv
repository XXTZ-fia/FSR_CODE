She loves the way this blouse sits on her shoulders and how well it flows into the three-quarter length sleeves. The sleeve length is great and since she has long arms, the blouse appears more like a short sleeve on her.  The polyester material is both soft and delicate.  With the flow of the materials double layer across the curves it does tend to create a slimming appearance.  Since this shirt is delicate and the material could wrinkle, we wash it in cold water on delicate cycle and then place it on a hanger to air dry.Most importantly, the blouse in the black stripes looks very beautiful on my wife and it makes her happy!  At the time of this review the Timeson Women's 3/4 Sleeve Blouse was selling for $29.99 which is an awesome price for a blouse of this quality and beauty.",
