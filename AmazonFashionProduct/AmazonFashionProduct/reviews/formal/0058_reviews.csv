It's lightweight and flowy, perfect for spring/summer/fall months. It's stretchy in the chest, which helped it fit without being too constricting. I'm a size XL and I ordered a size XL - I would say that it runs true to size. The arms and legs fit me well. It has pockets! The only issue I had - if I pulled the chest up to where I wanted it, the crotch was riding a little high... if you have a longer torso you may want to be wary of how this will fit you. Overall, I still think I'll be able to wear it, but I just wish it would fit a little better!",
