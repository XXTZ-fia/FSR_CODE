It fits well, feels well made, and looks good under a suit jacket.

But I'm happy to say that what this brand lacks in grasping of how phonetic consonants work, it makes up for in producing a very decent article of clothing. I wear a lot of white button shirts with suits for work and I'm usually a size 16 with 32/33 length sleeves. This doesn't have number sizing, so I picked a ""Large"" and it seems to be spot on for the neck and fit over my torso. The sleeves are a bit long, perhaps closer to 33/34, but that's kind of expected since most shirts I see in size 16-17 have sleeves that are an inch longer than my size (I have to search around to find my exact fit usually). Since I almost always end up rolling the sleeves up this hasn't been an issue, and I just just realizing I'm wearing this shirt as I write this review! I wish the brand would pick a name that didn't sound like gibberish, but the product is pretty good.",

So I knew this wasn't going to work for me but I also did not like the collar style as it is too small (not too tight as fit is fine) ...I also did not like the fabric as I prefer a more cotton-like feel in my dress shirts and this felt very synthetic. It is a nice smooth finish and should be easy care and the detail stitching around the collar and buttons was fine. Just doesn't suit me well and I didn't want a REAL grey...just the greyish blue shown.,

The shirt has a classic spread collar and a regular fit, making it suitable for a variety of occasions. It can be dressed up for a formal event or dressed down for a more casual look.

It's very well made with good construction. I got the Tall size which gave me plenty of sleeve length. I washed once but the creases from packaging persist. I've not tried ironing yet but I assume they will eventually come out. The good news after laundering is there were no addition wrinkles whatsoever after washing. That's a plus for the material. The collar has a nice amount of rigidity to it like a nice dress shirt should have, plus it has the stiffeners. I'll give it 5 stars based on the low price point. Hope this helps.",
