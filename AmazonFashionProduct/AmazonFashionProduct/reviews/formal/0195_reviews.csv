Kevin H.,Pretty dress but didn't fit my body type,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TEWBNG266IGQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJY1BMPK,"3.0 "," the United States "," February 26, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Pink,Verified Purchase,This dress is true to color and size. I’m 5’3 106lbs and smaller B bra size. I got the size small. The dress fit overall was perfect. But what I don’t like was the top material over the chest area. Of you were a bigger busted woman and could push that piece out it would look nice. But I felt like it was just a lot of extra material on my smaller bust. Nice length and a small slit in the back. Felt very comfortable and was form fitting but didn’t feel restrictive.,24

I knew I would love this dress just looking at it. Low and behold when I received it and tried it on, it fits perfectly. It's very comfortable and flattering even to those of us with a belly. It scrunches around the belly given a more flattering look. It fits very well hugging without showing everything. It's thin yet, it's not see through. It comes right under my knees length wise. I have larger arms and I am always pleased when dresses and tops fit my arms accordingly. This dress does this without causing me to go up in size making the rest of the dress too large and uncomfortable. This dress is perfect and I plan to get it in each color offered. I believe it's nice to be dressed down for a date night, it can be semi formal for an even and it can be worn to a formal event as well. It's so diverse without loosing its flattery.",27

The fit is true to size per the chart and the details are intentional and very flattering. There’s plenty of stretch throughout the waist and “skirt” and the ruching helps to conceal any midsection pudge. If you pair with your favorite shapewear you are sure to achieve an hour glass effect. This dress is bodycon done modestly with elegance and appeal!,5

If you are on the thicker side (like myself), you will need shapewear with this dress as it does show your lumps/bumps and curves. 2. Like another reviewer commented, I also ordered the blue dress and I did notice that the crisscross fabric over the chest, as well as the sleeves are a different color (and possibly different material) than the dress component itself.

Jennifer C-K,Grace Karin for The Win--Again!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33P4NF8Q9QOWO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJY1BMPK,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 28, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Wine Red,,"I recently discovered Grace Karin and all I can say is “wow”. I rarely find a designer that so matches my individual style and makes me want every item in the collection. Even better, Grace Karin has excellent, comfortable and predictable sizing.  This dress is just gorgeous. I love the wine color, which just glimmers in the light. This jewel-toned dress is perfect for the upcoming holiday season and this shade of light red wine, not being evergreen or a tone associated with the holiday season, allows you even more options for wearing it.  I did not find a sharp color difference between the main body of the dress and the sleeves. I do not consider the sleeves sheer, as they are certainly thick enough for me to feel comfortable and warm while not wearing this dress with a blazer or a sweater over it. I did have to steam gently to remove the wrinkles, but the fabric blend itself makes that a breeze. It also did not wrinkle through the day, leaving you looking fresh and sharp.  I have never been disappointed by a Grace Karin design, and this is no exception. I always find items to be true to size and flattering. The ruching on this dress helps conceal any hip or tummy areas you may feel self-conscious about. I have had no issues with the neckline and have found that it drapes nicely. The size chart is always spot-on; if you are wavering on a size, I would choose to size down.  If you are on the fence over Grace Karin designs, take the jump. You won’t regret it.",2

The dress itself is made of a very light and thin material. You almost have to be extremely fit to not have any bulging appear. The ruffle in the midsection hides a tad bit of belly but not much. The chest area is a bit awkwardly shaped with the mesh. If you have a big chest like she does, it extra fabric at the chest sits out weirdly on the sides. The length is great as it is appropriate for the office. The color is great, too, for the season. The feel of the dress is okay.

First, you cannot tell from the listing photos but the front drape on the bust of this dress and the sleeves are a different fabric and color than the rest of the dress. The bodice of the dress is a knit and the drape/sleeves are a sheer material. And the color difference is quite noticeable in certain lighting. The fabric overall is not bad just seems like a patchwork with the varying materials and shades of blue. I think I would have almost preferred the 2 fabrics being 2 completely different colors.  This dress was pretty easy to steam. Only a few minutes or so. The zipper glides easily.  I do like the fit though and the way it looks. The dress hugs the body and flatters curves without being too tight or revealing. The sleeves are a little short for me. I ordered the Small and I am 5'10, 125 lbs, 32-26-35, 24"" long arms for reference.  If you’re not bothered by the shading difference then this is a great dress.",60
