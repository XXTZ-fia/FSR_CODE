This was a hard search in the summer, but after playing around with search terms I found several options on Amazon, including this dress. I received numerous complements! The material had weight to it - it wasn't heavy, but felt quality, the high/low ruffled hem was stunning and fun, and the sleeves were perfect- not too long, not too short. And the blue was the perfect royal blue, so I was very pleased with this find, and it's under $50! My only criticism is the extra fabric inside the dress around the vneck. The vneck itself was not deep (so no worries there about cleavage), it was the perfect v, but the extra material underneath would not lay flat. You could see the outline of the seam through the dress ever-so-slightly. I was tempted to cut it off as close to the stitching as I could, but I didn't want to chance it before the event. In summary, if you are looking for a classy but fun, quality, special event dress, this is a great option.",8

I’m a size 22 and the 2XL size fits me perfectly. The color is just beautiful and the fabric feels thick and heavy. The dress is well made with gorgeous details. I’m sufficiently impressed enough that I’m wearing this dress to church on Easter Sunday.,

The material is soft and thick. One problem with is is that it is mostly Nylon. My wife said she feels the fabric is lacking something, although she cannot quite put her finger on it. It has some stretch and is quite form fitting. It will show undergarments through the material so you may need no-show undergarments. However, for the price, this is a great dress option and the minor flaws are not really that big of an issue considering that formal dresses typically go for much more. I give it 5-stars.",13
Montana,"This is a substantial, high-quality dress suitable for business and formal occasions",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33KD1VNPJ8H98/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSCY53MT,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 17, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,,"For reference, I am 5ft 1in, 112lbs, 34 D/E chest, 27 waist, 37 hip. I ordered the small and it fits as expected. The black dress will be very suitable for any business event, funeral or other dressy occasion. It is modest but attractive and not dowdy. The fabric has good stretch so it will conform to your body without being tight. The fabric is thick enough it will not show every little fold, ripple and bump - so that's nice too. I love the bell sleeves and ruffle at the wrap hem, they add interest without being fussy.  I hope my review has been of some help.

The color is also the same as the images - I got the wine red and it's the same shade as the pictures.",3
