The double layer look allowed me to get away with not wearing a coat to a semi formal masquerade party in the summer. I had a pair of grey slacks from a brand called A[x]ist or Axist that were almost the same color and matched very well. The fit was very nice; it has a slim fit that actually fit. Last time I had a waistcoat, it was too wide at the waist even thought the chest and hips fit. Obviously I'm not wearing this to a gala with all the millionaires I don't know, but the construction quality is very nice. It's worth noting the lapels on the upper layer don't continue into a collar around the back like a sport coat; it looks like a vest from the back. I would recommend this vest to anyone looking to spruce up their casual events or for semi formal events in hot weather (no sleeves!). I would buy it again in another color if I need it.

We bought this for my son's prom.  He is in a wheelchair so a wearing a standard jacket is an issue.  We like that this looked formal while leaving his arms free to move and not bunching up under/behind him like a jacket would.  That said 2 things need to be notes.  First it runs maybe a size small compared to other clothes so size up.  Second I wish the back was slit.  The adjusters on the back offer a huge range of sizing except that the back piece is a solid piece of fabric so the adjuster strap doesn't actually do much at all but hang there or bunch up wads of fabric .  If the back was slit it would allow tightening the straps to overlap smoothly without bunching or loosening the straps to give additional width by opening up slightly.  We were able to do the alterations ourselves by splitting the lining at the seam and cutting the back fabric up the middle from the tail to between the shoulder blades and hemming it all together.  That allowed a lot more usability of the adjuster straps and the back of the vest to lay more flat.  That single change being standard would really help with fit I think.,3

I can picture him wearing this again because the style would cross several eras. It seems like it jas many applications. He could probably pull it off for a more casual wedding or a Ren fest. It was comfortable and it didn't really wrinkle too bad. I only had to throw it in the dryer wirh some wrinkle spray out of the package and away we went. Most importantly, he hates to dress up and he seemed like he was comfortable all night amd even enjoyed it. He did not ask to take it off in a half hour like he would have a suit jacket.",
