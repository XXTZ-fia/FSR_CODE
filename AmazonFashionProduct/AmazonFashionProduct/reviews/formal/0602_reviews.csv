The one and only complaint that my daughter had was that the high neckline felt a little constricting at times.",

I try out new products, and then provide an honest, unbiased review, based on my personal impressions and experience. I am not paid for my reviews.I own several Grace Karin garments for myself, and have been very please with the quality of this brand, so when I saw this girls dress, I decided to order it for my granddaughter. I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed. This little dress is stylish, with a classic A-line design, and a smocked bodice to add some interesting detail.  It fit true-to-size, which surprised me a little, since my granddaughter is very tall for her age. The fabric is polyester, but it's lightweight and has a lot of flow -- a very ""girly-girl"" dress, if you get my gist.  I was a little concerned that the high neckline would be uncomfortable, but since there is smocking in the bodice, the neck also stretches, so no problem there.  Vibrant colors and quality stitching throughout that holds up well in the laundry.  A wonderful addition to my granddaughter's wardrobe that she has already gotten lots of use from!",

She had no problem being her active, little self in it and didn’t want to take the dress off at the end of the day. Very pleased with the quality!",

We ordered as usual and the dress fits exactly like what we expected.  The materials are a little heavier than I expected, and its mainly due to the bunting underneath the dress.  I would recommend this worn more on cooler spring or fall days and even into winter when paired with some leggings.  The assembly of the dress is of very high quality, and I can foresee getting a lot of wear and tear out of this.  Overall I think that this is a very nice dress, that would be great for back to school, christmas, weddings, church, or any more than casual outings.  It could also make a great gift.",
