Even though my son is a southern boy, I didn't want him to get heat stroke, because he will never notice, so the lighter the material, the better. This paid off for sure. It does not fit perfectly, but I never considered that it would. The buttons on the front of the jacket seem to be off just a little bit causing the neckline to fold the inside flap just a bit, amplifying the obviousness of it not fitting quite right, but it is for a 5yo, not a person that would know how to wear a suit correctly anyway.  The fabric is not super sturdy, but having it fit for a full year would be a miracle anyway, so as long as the little person wearing it is not playing rugby, or wrestling bears, it should be ok for the short time it will fit your little one.  I can't personally say that it is comfortable to wear, or if it breaths as well, but my son has no complaints after wearing it for 6 hours and he didn't look uncomfortable in it.  Ultimately, he looks just too cute in it and he absolutely loves (any kind of) blue, so he WANTS to wear it. It is usually impossible to get him to wear anything with buttons on it, so personally, that is a feature also.",

This ensemble truly deserves a solid five-star rating for its impeccable craftsmanship, attention to detail, and overall elegance.  First and foremost, the tuxedo set includes everything needed for a complete formal outfit, from the dress clothes and plaid shirt to the vest, pants, and suspenders. The lake blue color adds a touch of sophistication and uniqueness to the ensemble, standing out beautifully against traditional black or navy options.  The quality of the materials used is outstanding, with each piece tailored to perfection. The vest and pants fit my son perfectly, offering a comfortable yet polished look ideal for formal occasions such as weddings, proms, or special events. when worn with a plaid shirt it adds a trendy twist to the classic tuxedo style, adding personality and flair to the outfit.  I was particularly impressed with the suspenders, which add a stylish touch and provide practicality and functionality. They ensure that the pants stay securely in place without the need for a belt, offering both convenience and style.  Pros:  Complete Set: This tuxedo set includes everything needed for a formal outfit, including a vest, pants, plaid shirt, and suspenders, providing convenience and ensuring a coordinated look.  Impeccable Quality: The materials used in the ensemble are of outstanding quality, with each piece tailored to perfection, offering a polished and sophisticated appearance.  Stylish Design: The lake blue color adds a touch of sophistication and uniqueness to the outfit, while the plaid shirt adds a trendy twist to the classic tuxedo style, providing both style and personality.  Comfortable Fit: The vest and pants fit comfortably, offering a snug yet comfortable fit that's ideal for formal occasions, ensuring that your son looks and feels his best throughout the event.  Functional Suspenders: The suspenders not only add a stylish touch to the ensemble but also provide practicality by keeping the pants securely in place without the need for a belt, offering both convenience and style.  Cons:  Size Limitations: Some customers may find that the sizing of the tuxedo set is not consistent with standard sizing charts, leading to issues with fit, especially for taller or broader boys.  Color Variation: While the lake blue color adds uniqueness to the outfit, it may not be suitable for all occasions or preferences, limiting its versatility in comparison to more traditional colors like black or navy.  Overall, this set exceeded my expectations in every aspect. Its impressive quality, stylish design, and attention to detail make it a standout choice for any young man needing formal attire. I highly recommend it to parents looking to dress their sons in sophisticated yet trendy outfits for special occasions.",

Both the jacket and vest are fully lined and have several real pockets.  The jacket has an inside top pocket, and the outside breast pocket sports a false hankie that can be folded down neatly inside if you don't want it to show.  The vest has a nice buckle on the back too.  The pants have an adjustable elastic and button waist.  The seams along the waist and fly are sewn with seam binding to keep them from fraying, stretching out of shape and to keep them lying flat.  These are touches seldom seen on boy's clothing.  The suit also comes with a coordinating pre-tied tie.  I would say the sizing is true to size, or maybe slightly larger.  My grandson is tall and on the thin side, wearing a size 10 or 12 in most clothes, depending on the brand.  I ordered a size 12 and it is a bit big, but that's OK as it gives him room for growth.  I will be shortening the sleeves and pants for now though.  Don't be concerned by the video on Amazon that shows the model wearing an extremely short-sleeved and short-panted suit.  They are NOT short in reality.  My grandson was super excited to wear the suit on Easter and he looked very dapper indeed.",
