However, the size was larger than expected so the thin lining of the top is constantly riding up and getting wrinkled and needs to be pulled down all the time to keep the back and hips looking smooth. However, that's nothing compared to how 'snaggy' ALL of the sequins and thread are. The sleeves are forever getting stuck to the rest of the top, unless you hold your arms away from your body the entire time you have it on.
