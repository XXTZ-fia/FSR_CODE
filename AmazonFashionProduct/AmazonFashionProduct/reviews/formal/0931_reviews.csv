The pants were a little baggy in the hips and thighs area so I took them in a little bit too.  For a suit that I bought for this price I needed for a funeral it is the bomb.

Summary: Overall, the Luvamia Women's Two Piece Set is a fantastic addition to any professional wardrobe. With its stylish design and comfortable fit, it’s perfect for a day at the office or a business casual event. The only drawbacks are the limited color options and potential sizing issues, but these are minor compared to the benefits. Highly recommend for anyone looking to elevate their work attire! 💼✨",

Excellent for working professionals.,15

It's very nice and comfortable. I'm short at 5'1"" and the length of the pants was really good. The pants are also very comfortable for all day wear at the office, and I really love the material of this set. The blazer looks a bit baggy, however, the sleeves are wide. This is not a deal breaker for me, however, since the ""baggy"" look is in style these days. Overall, it's a really great quality set!",4

I have a very pronounced hour glass figure, which can make finding pants and jackets a challenge. I usually order a medium but sometimes need a large. I went on a limb ordering a medium in this suit but it paid off. It fits me like a glove. The color is exactly as described, and while the elastic waistband may not be the most popular style choice, it's not noticeable with the jacket or a belt on, and it makes these stretchy and comfortable. The suit is well made, with a liner, even hemlines and no loose threads. The color is as pictured and I don't need to get the pants hemmed. It hits me just slightly below my ankle. It came just slightly wrinkled but a quick steamer and they came out easily. I will likely be back to buy another one of these suit sets in different colors. I love it that much!!!",9

The pant legs fit perfect in length for me (5""2""). I ordered my size, size medium for a size 8 fit and the waist fits perfectly. The zipper and buttons on the pants do face the opposite way but it's not a big deal. I'm not a big fan of the scrunched effect on the back side of the pants, so I would not wear it without the jacket too. The material feels nice as well. It's very well made and the material stretches. It's quite comfortable to wear and it looks great.",3

Somewhere on Earth,Jacket is perfect but pants need some work,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21S4C41MRSF3Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF2QZV3W,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 13, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Beige,,"Had to try this on with a few different tops to get a feel for it. The jacket is perfect! The sleeves accommodate my long arms but can be folded/cuffed if you have shorter arms. The fit is tailored and for me looked custom made on my 5’3, 122 lb frame. The pants are another story. From the front they have a tapered look and look great but from the back the butt part some what hangs/sags and offers a slight unflattering look. The elastic waist works great for cinching in the front but I think it contributes to the unflattering back part. When the jacket is on top it hides the unflattering areas and gives a more polished look. The pants are cut low so even my height can pull them off with mules and have a slight bit of ankle showing.  The suit is slightly heavy and made with a thicker material. Is definitely more of a cool weather deal especially considering the jacket is recommended to be kept on if you’re about maintaining a sense of style.  I wouldn’t recommend this suit overall simply because wearing a jacket all day can be uncomfortable and I prefer versatile styling options. Wearing A sweater instead of the suit jacket gives this look very senior citizen vibes, for example.",2

The stitching is neat and durable, and the fabric feels luxurious and long-lasting. The blazer and pants maintain their shape well, even after multiple wears and washes. The attention to detail in the construction is evident, and I feel confident that this suit will remain a key part of my wardrobe for years to come.  The blazer fits snugly without being too tight, allowing for comfortable movement throughout the day. The pants have a flattering cut that complements my figure, and the waistband sits comfortably at the waist. The material is breathable and has a slight stretch, ensuring that I stay comfortable even during long hours at the office or in meetings.",
