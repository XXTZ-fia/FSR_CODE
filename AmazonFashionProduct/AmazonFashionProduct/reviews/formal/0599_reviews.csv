It's been sewn well.  It fits well and looks cute on.  I've already washed it in the washing machine and dried it in the dryer and it came out just fine.  This is great for the price and I'm happy I got it.  I recommend it to anyone else considering purchasing it.  Five stars.",

In execution, however, I find some issues. The cut of the crossover neckline continues over the breast, so that it tucks under one side, and the excess fabric really shows through. At the normal height of where the tucked piece diagonals down, it lays across the breast and makes a very obvious thick line where it runs. If you push it down, it still looks weird under the breast and it feels weird, too.  The crossed over piece really serves no function, either, so it would have been better if they just made a faux crossover at the V of the neck, like most people do. The rest of the shirt is fine- the sleeves are a good length, the material is neither rough nor soft, and the front bottom of the shirt continues in a unique way to end in a flap.",27

They are a nice weight and can be worn with jeans or a skirt.  I am 5'8"", 36 C-D, 145lbs, and I purchased size large.  I tried a medium in the sleeveless version of this top, however, it was slightly tight across the chest.  To remove the wrinkles, I tumbled them in the dryer on medium and hung them up immediately.  I do sew and have taken the sleeveless version of this top in about an inch in the waste to make them fit perfectly.  I may do the same with the 3/4 sleeve tops.  They are a great addition to any wardrobe and the price is amazing for the quality.",4
