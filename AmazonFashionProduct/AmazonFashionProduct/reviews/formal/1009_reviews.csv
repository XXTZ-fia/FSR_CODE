Waited over a week for it and I'm very disappointed. Also I noticed the buttons are sewed on weirdly with the threads going side to side through the 4 holes and not in a cross shape making them unravel easily. I only like them for the style with the plaid and pocket leather so I'm stuck with them despite the quality.",3
