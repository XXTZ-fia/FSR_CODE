Ok, I admit, I usually dress us matching, but only by direction, not by vanity, in other words, I'll pick him out what he can or should wear, or vice versa, and build off of one another. He said the legs are not that of a typical ""slim fit"", more of a regular fit. He likes the material, and he looks pretty good in it as well. Remember, real me wear pink! May God bless and I hope this helps",

Not all of them need to be name-brand, tailored-fitted pieces, but they need to look decent enough for work events. The WOMS 2-piece vest and pants fit the bill fairly well. There is a bit of sheen to the fabric, so be aware. This would be great for event staff (I was previously a traveling casino manager and this would have been perfect). Size-wise, it fits as expected based on the chart measurements. At 5' 7"" and weighing around 150 lbs, I typically wear size 30 pants for a close fit and size 32 for a loose comfortable fit. So I was torn between the XS (for my waist size) and S (for my chest size). I ignored the M by their graph chart. I went with the S to better accommodate my chest and for the slightly looser overall fit and I'm glad I did. It's comfortable and I retain range of motion. Don't forget your size will increase after eating too. The pants are quite spacious but they stay up well enough since I'm wearing a belt. Overall, I would recommend this as a decent 2-piece set, be it for event staff or light social/work events where you just need to look decent.",

Oscy,Great quality set,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSWXHNY3BGF4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDKSC8WZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 20, 2023",Color: Navy BlueSize: Large,,I liked this set a lot I think for the price for what you get is also pretty good. The pants were a little long but that's not that serious I can just get them altered. The vest fit great so I was happy about that. The pants feel was great because they kind of came with an adjustable strap that you can use for if you're a bigger guy so you could still feel comfortable not many pants from what I have offer that. Overall the material is very nice as well  . Just a note that the white shirt doesn't come included but definitely not a deal breaker. would recommend.,
DL,Nice design and fits well,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUVQWKQNVAMPJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDKSC8WZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 17, 2023",Color: BlackSize: Medium,,This suit is made of good material and it fits well for young man with slim body type. There is a black tie comes with this suits. The tie material and color matches the vest very well. I think this is great choice for my son’s prom dress. The size I ordered for him is a bit larger than his normal casual shirt size based on the recommendation from the product description.  The only issue I have is the product description indicates this suit requires dry clean but the material advantage section indicates this is “washable”. I probably would go with dry clean just to be safe.,
