But when I tried it on, I actually liked it. It fit my shape well and was comfortable. But where's the belt? It looks like pajamas or an entirely incomplete without a belt. Every picture for every color shows a matching tie belt and mine did not come with one. I tried matching it with several other belts I ordered off amazon and could not find one this dark (I ordered the navy blue), nor could I find anything in the store that made this attractive. I noticed some other reviewers stated theirs did not come with a belt either while other reviewers pictures show a matching belt. So which is it?  Includes a tie belt or not? I just couldn't come up with anything that made this look like a fashionable outfit in the time I had left for an upcoming wedding and am returning it.",
