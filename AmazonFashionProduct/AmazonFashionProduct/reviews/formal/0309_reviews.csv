I generally never have a problem with shirts being too short but have an issue with sleeves being too short. I rodered a size medium in the nutmeg colour.  The colour isn't bad. The sizing is on par with other mediums. The sleeves are, thankfully, long enough. However, I was really surpised by how short the sweater is. If I lift my arms, the sweater is up over my belly button. There is no way someone with a longer torso could wear this and have it not be a cropped sweater. This would all be fine, except for the wide banding at the bottom. The banding comes up too high to tuck it under, and it makes the bottom of the sweater drape weirdly, whereas it would otherwise drape nicely. That banding makes the entire sweater end up looking frumpy and unflattering. Had I tried this on in person, I would not have ended up purchasing it.",3

The look is timeless and sophisticated. I am in love with the color, the yummy shade of nutmeg.
