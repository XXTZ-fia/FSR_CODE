It's definitely ""open front"" because in addition to having no closure, the cut just constantly flaps open all over the place. The construction is two layers, the outer sequined layer and an inner layer that seems to be out of the bug screen for a tent. Which, if you were wondering, isn't comfortable against your skin. This dual layer construction looks as cheap as it sounds and feels. I put it at two stars because it does fulfill the role of ""sparkly af"" and if you have other layers it can function as costume clothing.",

The silver sequins are very shiny and well attached which I was worried they would easily fall off but so far none have.

I didn’t have an issue with the sequin shed, but I did shake it out before I tried it on. There are a few stray threads that I’m afraid to cut because I don’t know if they will make the sequins fall off so I’ll leave them unless they get in the way. Overall, this is an easy way to dress up any outfit and can be worn in many ways. If you want a more fitted waist you could add a belt or cinch the back with a pin on the inside. It did arrive wrinkled due to shipping, but those can be steamed out easily.",

I was pleasantly surprised by how well it fit – no tightness, and the arms fit just right. It feels great on the back, with just the right amount of stretch to keep it comfortable while still maintaining a polished, formal look.  Visually, this cardigan is a showstopper. I love how versatile it is, allowing me to easily dress up or down depending on the occasion. Despite having a larger chest, I was pleased to find that the cardigan stayed relatively 'closed,' giving it a casual yet chic appearance without any awkward sliding. The open front design is perfect for layering and adds a touch of elegance to any outfit.  One of my favorite details is the extra lace embellishment around the bottom of the sleeves and along the bust. This small touch really elevates the cardigan, giving it a playful and stylish vibe that stands out. The sequins are beautifully done, adding just the right amount of sparkle without being overwhelming.  The comfort level is exceptional, thanks to the soft and smooth full lining that prevents the sequins from scratching the skin. The fabric is soft, breathable, and easy to clean, making this cardigan a comfortable and fashionable choice for any occasion. Whether it’s a party, concert, wedding, or just a night out, this sequin cardigan will make you shine and stand out from the crowd.  Overall, this cardigan is a fantastic addition to my wardrobe. It’s comfortable, stylish, and versatile enough to pair with a variety of outfits.

I can get fidgety with jackets that lack buttons, but this one stays put due to the non-slippery lining inside.  The sequins are sewn on well, the jacket is a great length, and although it is super sparkly, it could be worn to a nice dinner or out to a concert (the reason I got it!). Holiday occasions would be a no-brainer; it's a great combination of being understated in design, and bold in presentation.  The jacket is warm to wear, so late summer nights through autumn could be the best time to sport this beauty on its own. I'm very happy with my purchase.
