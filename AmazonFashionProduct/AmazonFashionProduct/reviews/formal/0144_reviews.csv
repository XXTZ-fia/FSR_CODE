The shape of it is flattering, and there's enough room for me to comfortably move without feeling restricted or like I'm going to rip any seams. Haha. The length is lovely for wearing untucked, but also just long enough for times that I do want to tuck it in. Very versatile - can be dressed up or down, depending on what I pair it with.

The material is soft and the perfect thickness, and the shirt flows seamlessly, without any crinkles or awkward folds when I move. This is absolutely a stunning button down shirt and I've already ordered a second and plan to order a few more as well. The price point is just perfect for such a nice shirt as well.

O.k, to be expected when opening it up to have a few wrinkles from folding and transport. I went to my trusty wrinkle release spray and spray it down. No change. I sprayed it again. The shirt did not want to cooperate. After a 3rd time I found that only direct ironing removed wrinkles from the shirt.  I'm giving it 4 stars because the shirt itself is pretty, decently made and at a good price point. I just in no way whatsoever consider it wrinkle free or even wrinkle resistant.",2

The material feels sturdy and the seams feel well-stitched, but there's a catch. Based on the advertisement image, I expected it to fit pretty close-in about the waist, but of course, being on the tall and thin side, I have to be cautious about sizing. Unfortunately, this shirt was a no-win scenario for me, because while it *is* long enough, the sizing seems considerably more concerned with the waist diameter and, for someone with my build, it's a bad fit (context- 6'2"" and extremely light for that height). The shoulders and bust fit is really good, but it's really quite unflattering about my waist. While it's definitely wearable, I'm probably only going to when I can have a nice high-waisted skirt or something pull it in for me.  I'd like to think I would have been able to go down a size and have that fit better, but I suspect the shoulders would be too small at that point. For those of more typical heights, however, I suspect the sizing chart will lend you far more realistic estimates. Tall queens beware.",

The feeling of this shirt on my skin is so pleasant and it looks great on (as a dress), though I do wish it was the right size as I see this would have been a great fit. The fabric does not wrinkle so it looks great all day long!",

Swimming in Books,"Terrific, figure-flattering top",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JXL3ETUYZO0U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJHPFD49,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 6, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Olive Green,,"This is a great shirt. It is super comfy and the design is very figure flattering. As a woman with a larger busy (38D / 40C) but thinner waist, most button down shirts make me look larger, since the fabric hangs loosely from my larger top and hides my waist and curves. This shirt solves that problem--the front darts and the back darts offer a more fitted and figure-flattering look. I ordered a size 12 and I think that was the right size for me. If I were a tiny bit smaller, a size 10 would have been great. I highly recommend this shirt!",

The material is soft and thick enough to provide full coverage without being heavy or bulky. Well sewn with no loose seems and few threads to snip it steamed out very easily and holds it shape well. The one thing I would have liked to have is it being a bit longer so it tucks into slacks and stays put easier. I’m 5’2” and found if I raised my arms above my head the sides came out of my pants but it’s an amazing shirt so that’s a small issue to me.,3

Overall impression is that I will be wearing it frequently, once the weather cools down a tiny bit. Thoughts as follows:  Pros: thick. Buttons are sewn on well. Fabric doesn't feel cheap at all. Collar is really nice. Size accurate. Color is spot on for the image in the listing. Would be a very nice dress shirt for work and would pair nicely with a sweater on top of it during the cold weather months.  Cons: none. A great shirt.",2
