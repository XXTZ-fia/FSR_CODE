My advice I would like to share is beware. It you been ordering some garments from Amazon most of us know that some sizes are not true to size from China. But I’m here to say this top is true to size in America size. So unfortunately yet again I may decide to return to go down another size due to being still a tad bit too loose still. Order your true size. Do not go back what is recommended size based off your order history if most of your garments are non US size. You will be in for a rude awakening that it will either be 1 or 2 sizes too big for you.  The material is heavy and of good quality. I like that the zipper blends in and doesn’t show unlike something I ordered similar a few years back with a yellow zipper. My concern would be that the quality of pull on the zipper might break, in which I hope not. But overall the quality of the fabric and style is spectacular.",

I love this “shirt”. I bought this to wear with a more fancier classical music concert. I’m thankful it’s taking place in Dec! Because if you’re the type to get hot easily you might steer clear of this piece! Just me trying it on for this photo and I was sweating a lot! 😅 It’s very thick and hot! It is mostly polyester after all. Also I felt that it was a lil scratchy feeling. I’m hoping once I run it through the wash with some fabric softener it’ll help with that. I also have to say if you are large chested (I’m an M cup) you might wanna size up. I usually can fit into a 1x but I thought I’d size up. Good thing I did. And really I could have sized up to a 3x. Those are my only complaints. But overall I love the look of it! I love how it looks with my other pieces. I gave it 4 stars just because of those few complaints other wise I’d give it 5 stars. But regardless I love the piece! 😍,16

In the Amazon's photo, the outfit looks very elegant, but the Quality is better for informal regular events, for instance: dinners, Valentine's, Christmas or nice winter parties. No very good for cocktail wedding. I'm 5.2 and 115 lbs, so I got size ""S"". I have narrow shoulders and new breast, so in the chest zone is loose like ""L"". However, the height is OK. I bought a belt to get a better final look. Conclusion: it's a nice, original top, warm enought for weather, but no the best option for a super elegante ocasión. The funny situation is the outfit looks so nice when you're stand up or dancing. If you will be seating around the table (dinner) people only will see the chest part of the top, very bored and loose.",18
