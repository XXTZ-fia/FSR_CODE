This is a really strange issue that I have never experienced before. As this shirt is 100% cotton, there is no stretch, yet the shirt is just loose enough not to need a stretch, except at the elbow.

I have a very odd build (wide shoulders, smaller waist, average neck, and big arms) and finding shirts that fit is difficult to begin with. I like slim or athletic fit because regular fit has too much fabric around the torso and I have to tuck all of that material into my waistband and it just too bulky. Slim and athletic fits usually give me the room I need in the shoulders, arms, and neck without the extra torso material. This shirt was a bit different in that the arms were also slim cut, so it just about cut off the circulation to my hands. The shoulder were also a bit tight as well. This just wasn't my fit. If you are going to order, just know this shirt is cut for the tall, skinnier fellows. Overall construction was fine. I would even say the stitching is strong, as I didn't break any seams when trying it on and flexing my arms in it, which really put the construction to the test. I like the shirt, but I will have to try another cut, either regular or athletic next time. Four stars for fit and finish. The mistake in overall fit was mine, not the brand.",

The shirt originally was gonna take about 2 weeks to come, but after it was shipped, it came the following day, which is always nice.  The shirt is well-made ty and feels super soft when I wear it. The stitching is perfect and the buttons are a really nice detail. I recommend getting this shirt for any dressier events you have coming up.",
Andres,Great shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1F8SAI8BKNYFL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDMFP7B5,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 14, 2024","Color: Blue Micro Stripe-navy HorseSize: 14""-14.5"" Neck 32""-33"" Sleeve",,I received this shirt as part of the Amazon Vine Program. The shirt is beautiful and well crafted. I was a little hesitant since I generally order cotton shirts for my dress shirts. On the site it states that it is a polyester spandex mix but the feel is almost like cotton. It fits me perfectly and looks really nice. This shirt is perfect for a formal or a semi formal occasion.,

It fits perfectly and the material is comfortable.  It arrived really quickly and was packed nicely to avoid folding of the collar.  Overall, this is a perfect dress shirt for me!",
DesertCat,Attractive and Flattering,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7I702LEU7UJ8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDMFP7B5,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 12, 2024","Color: Black-silver HorseSize: 15""-15.5"" Neck 32""-33"" Sleeve",,"This is nicer than I expected for the price, it's a peached material, and slim in a flattering way. The collar and cuffs are very stiff. Should be easy to care for and looks sharp. Size 15-15.5 has a 42"" bust and is basically a slim medium. I would consider getting this in another color. The fabric says stretch but it's not really stretchy.",
