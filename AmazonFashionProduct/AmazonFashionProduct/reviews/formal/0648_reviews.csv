I was invited to an ""Orange"" party by some hot looking cougar I picked up at Costco in the dessert section.  When I saw her looking at desserts I went up to her and told her those were some nice looking muffins she had.  She was putty in my hands after that.  So anyways, like I said she invited me to this Orange party.  Im like WTF is that?  Never heard of it. She said it was just like a white party but everybody wears orange instead.  Im like ok Im down with that.  So we exchanged numbers and we met up this past weekend for the party.  I ordered this shirt so I can wear it to the orange party.  I really made this shirt look good!  I already get a lot of attention from the ladies when I go out because Im such a good looking dude. So I get to the party to meet her and women were drooling when they saw me walk in with this bright orange shirt.  It fit very well and hugged and clinged onto my bulging muscles.  I really stood out with this shirt even more than I usually do.  Needless to say this cougar I was with was all over me.  Her invite to this party was a pretense to get me in the sack which worked HA!,.  Anyway,  I highly recommend this shirt.  It's soft, great fit, and orange as heck.  I love it.",13
