It's boxier than I anticipated, which I genuinely thing has to do with where the neckline sits. The sleeves puff up more than I thought they would at the shoulders, which I don't really care for.  The thing I really like about this blouse, though, is the color. I got the green, and it's a nice rich, deep color. It's exactly as pictured.  I wish I liked this top better. I was seeking pieces I would wear in and out of the office, but I'm just not sure how much use I'll get because I don't feel confident in it due to the fit on me.",
