NOW the cons…the dress is MUCH lower cut in the v-neck than shown and I ended up sewing a modesty panel into it to “cover”.  The biggest disappointment was the fact that it comes wrinkled. You can enjoy wearing it wrinkled and don’t even attempt to remove those wrinkles because you can’t and trying to do so only makes it worse!!!  So I wore a really nice dress that looked like I slept in it to the gala because I waited to long to try and “iron”/steam/wash them out.  And now it’s too late to return it.

There was also a nice weight to the fabric that makes it feel like it'll last a long time. Unlike most other stores on Amazon, this one actually sold what it advertised. Neckline is ""just"" right, but I'm sure cleavage will be more noticeable if you wear a push-up bra (when does that NOT happen, though?). If you told me you had bought it at Belk or JCPenney, I would believe you. Definitely worth the price. 10/10 would buy again. I hope the other dresses from Pinup Fashion are made like this one.",5
