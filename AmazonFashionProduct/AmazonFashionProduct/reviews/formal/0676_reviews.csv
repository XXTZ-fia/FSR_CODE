The velvet is quite stretchy so the bodice flatters while the full skirt flows beautifully.  I paired the dress with a gold and burgundy pashmina and got so many compliments.  The only con was that I wasn't really sure what to do with the bow/belt. I am plus size so this might not be an issue for a more slender build. It is sewn on and for my size it isn't long enough to be a belt, but it's a bit long and narrow to tie to the side. It wasn't bad enough to mitigate my delight, but I would've liked it to be a little longer and thicker.",

Unable to reach the zipper in the back, I did have to ask a family member for help zipping it, which led to the question ""Are you dressing like a pilgrim for something?""

It offers a fitting silhouette that's flattering to different body types. The bow belt is also fashionable and functional. While it looks stunning in its original form, the fact that it can be modified for various fashion statements adds a touch of versatility to an already versatile dress. Whether you're aiming for a classic, vintage look, or seeking to infuse a dash of contemporary flair, the bow belt allows for that personal touch.  Perfect for formal events, cocktail parties, weddings, or church functions. In a world where fast fashion often compromises on quality, the Velvet Vintage Tea Dress was a hit, and brownie points were awarded. Highly recommended!",2

There is also no loops for the belt. So if you don’t have a waist, sorry your belt won’t stay up much.  Otherwise it is gorgeous, thick fabric, made well and super comfortable.",12
