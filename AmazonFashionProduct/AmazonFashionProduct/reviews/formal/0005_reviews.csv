The suit arrived quickly and fit very well with the waist tabs adjusted in the pants, but the tuxedo shirt included was way too small. I paired it with a vest/tie set that I also bought here on Amazon to add the pop of color I was looking for. I would likely purchase from this seller again if the price was right.  I liked it so much I bought this suit again in black, size 10 boys. This time it didn't fit so well. The cut was really off around the neck and shoulders of the jacket so it didn't lay well at all. Otherwise it's a decent suit.",2

Our son only wore this during mass and shortly after for his first Holy Communion and the jacket did not make it. It started to unstitch at multiple seams. This was not caused by our son, rather the poor quality of stitching as i noticed it was not tightly stitched when we first opened it. Looked really really nice and worked for the one time we needed it but certainly not worth the money we spent!",
