Traci,"Bamboo Soft, and the DETAILS!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BIIPAU1EPHXA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7CMZZBZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 20, 2024",Color: Capri BlueSize: 3-6 Months,,"I am in love with this little outfit for my grandson! The top is so soft, it feels like bamboo. It is a knit fabric with a bit of stretch, just enough for comfort. Working buttons, not just sewn on for looks. Cuffs keep sleeves from covering baby's hands. The snaps in the crotch are a bit difficult to get open, hoping those get a little easier with use. The bow tie has a tiny elastic loop to slip over the top button, I find it looks better if the loop is slipped over the bottom of that button so the tie doesn't droop. Faux pocket with trim matching the tie, pants and hat. Very subtle but pretty leaf print. The pants have real pockets! WHAAAAAT?! I'm not sure why that tickles me, but it's an example of how detailed this tiny outfit is. Faux back pockets, waistband is elasticized on the sides for fit, and there are 2 buttons on the front on each side to attach the suspenders, pick which one makes it fit best for your baby. Pants are made of soft, silky fabric with no stretch (other than the waistband). This outfit is worth every penny of the $33.98 price in my opinion. The little hat is adorable but won't be worn since I ordered the 3-6 month, no way he's keeping that on! As far as sizing, I'd say this fits more on the 6m side.",

I love little Dapper outfits like these. They're great for church, weddings, and other formal events. I ordered a size 12-18 month and the top is a button snap onesie style. I'm not crazy about this for an outfit in this size. But the fabric of the shirt is very soft and should be comfortable against your little one's skin. The bow tie has an elastic loop that allows it to fit over the button. The pants have functional pockets while the back pockets are just for show. The newsboy cap has a bit of elastic just at the back. Overall I think the outfit is very cute and stylish.",

The “leather” on the suspenders is the cheapest part of the entire outfit but held up through two events for us. The bodysuit is a stretchy, soft cotton which fit my 3mo old very snug everywhere, especially in the neck. The snappers at the bottom made diaper changes easy. The baby is about 15 pounds and about 24 inches long. We ordered the 3-6 month size. The pants were long so I rolled them under. The hat was also large so he didn’t wear it too much, despite his head being in a very high percentile for circumference for his age. It tended to slide down his face. Cute for a few photos though. I am going to keep it for when his head gets larger. The bow tie is easy to get on and off the top button. My baby was pretty comfortable in the outfit. I feel like it was a good purchase, despite some things being snug while others were large. It was generally the right size and with the variation in baby shapes and sizes, you can’t nail it all.",2

I Love-LOVE-LOVE-LOVE this outfit. It’s size 6monthsand my baby is 6 months although on the smaller size. From what I can tell this is pretty true to size. I love the onesie shirt. It’s a nice soft, stretchy and wrinkle-free fabric. The snap on buttons at the bottom are white and hold together strongly. The suspenders are also good and durable. The khaki pants are like grown men pants shrunk to size, with thick fabric. They do wrinkle easy. It came with a bow which I opted not to put on him for pictures but is cute. Finally the color, shape and size of hat are all wonderful but it’s a thin, flimsy make and wrinkles very easily. For that reason alone, I gave this fit 4 stars.. I was hoping for a sturdy hat although the price point would reasonably go up. I definitely recommend this little fit if you are into the dapper 1920’s look.
