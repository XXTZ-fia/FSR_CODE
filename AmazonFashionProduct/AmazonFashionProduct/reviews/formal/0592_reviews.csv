In the listing, the photos make this look gorgeous - it's a deep maroon color that has the appearance of wool almost. But in person, it just looks like a cheap sharkskin red suit and I will probably never wear it in public. I absolutely despise when companies list photos for a different product that looks nothing like what you receive and the color is WAY off on this. Coofandy is generally a brand I would trust but this was a miss.  The only plus I can think to mention is that the pants have a ton of stretch in the waist which makes them super comfy to wear, but this thing needs a tailor like I need a million bucks.",

I ended up ordering an XL and thankfully it fit (usually wear a 48R and 34 or 36 waist pants). The pants have a nice built-in stretch waist so there is a little play in the size and also makes it more forgiving in seasonal variation of body size. The jacket was a little tight in the center chest but still forgiving enough so make it wearable, just would have to unbutton it to sit down. The material is what you'd expect from a suit in this price range and would be comparable to what you'd find at an H&M store. I like the light grey color since it was what I was missing in my wardrobe and will be a good option for spring and summer. I did wish it was 2 button instead of 1, but could help in dressing it down with a pair of nice jeans or a non-dress shirt under it. Also not a fan of the sewn-in pocket square, if you even want to call it that, since it only sticks out a tiny bit and is just a plain white verses something that would go with any color dress shirt. Might try and remove it since I am not a fan. Overall this is a decent option for the price and was satisfied with how it fit, considering it's always a gamble ordering online.",
Wolo P.,More like 3 1/2 stars,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMZ9YGEKNI8J3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXZQWYH,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 8, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Dark Blue,,"Overall, I like the suit just fine, but I do have a few things to mention. Being that it was a classic fit suit, I decided to order a medium as opposed to a large, which I would normally order. I think that was a smart decision, because the fit of the medium was quite good on my frame. Just for reference, I'm 5 foot 11 and 195 lbs. My build is muscular, because I train about five days a week, and have done so for decades. So, if you are similar to me in so far as your body type, then I would recommend the medium. As is usually the case everything fits well, but for the pant legs being too long. These pants will certainly need to be hemmed, and the model in the listing must be over 6 feet tall. The one thing that I was sort of not the biggest fan of, is the color. I chose the navy blue, because I wanted a nice dark blue suit. While the suit is certainly dark blue, the fabric has embedded within it some black strands as well as dark blue. So, you get this effect of a blue suit with black strands. After seeing the listing again, I inspected the pictures closely, and noticed that there actually was one picture that depicts accurately what the fabric looks like. When you see the other pictures of the model wearing the suit, it just seems like it's a regular navy suit, which is what I wanted. Don't get me wrong, it's not ugly by any stretch of the imagination, it's just not exactly as I had anticipated. That being said, it's a fairly well made suit, that does sort of feel a little like its price range. It has a nice style, but it does feel like polyester. There are some nice features like a built in pocket square, and a stretchy waistband for the pants. All in all, it's a decent suit, but not one that blew me away. Once I get the pants hemmed, I'm sure I'll like it a lot more, but my initial impressions are mostly positive.",5

I typically do not have any reason to wear formal attire but this turned out to be a great purchase. However, there is one notable aspect that influenced my overall assessment of the suit: the fabric weight. The suit feels heavy and can be a bit cumbersome if worn in hot weather so make sure to plan accordingly.",
Patrick C,"Kind of Fits, Kind of Doesn’t",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11VB1W2U6YI2A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXZQWYH,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 6, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Dark Gray,,"WHAT’S INCLUDED: Suit Jacket Suit Pants  PRODUCT/THOUGHTS: I got the size XL in dark grey. This is a little bit hard since usually in the USA when it comes to formal clothes for men, we don’t go off of L, XL, XXL..etc We usually work with numbers directly.  The pants actually fit well, and they actually have elastic stretch in them for the waist which is FANTASTIC because I always feel like that is the most comfortable. The length came in for me though at about 32 inches and that's a little bit on the long side (I'm usually odd-sized, at 31 inseam) but it's okay.  The jacket mostly fits, It has a bit of tapering along the sides, but it’s just a little bit too slim for me as I’m a person with wide shoulders. That also widens my overall girth. So I can’t button this jacket and sit down. Have to leave it open. So it feels like the jacket doesn’t quite match the size of the pants included. I would need the same size pants that I got, but with one size up of Jacket for this to work correctly (XXL) with how this is made. I also found one odd thing with the jacket. The shoulders have a bit of too much flair at the corners. I’ll try to share an image of what I’m talking about. It didn’t come out very good on camera, but they stick up just a bit too much even though the jacket as it is, is actually a bit Snug. This would make sense if the jacket itself was too big on me, but it’s not.  Overall the construction is actually pretty good though and this beats out some other suit separates that I have reviewed. They give you an extra jacket button as well. Although I do wish this was a double-breasted suit and not a single closure.",2

The jacket did fit very well, and you can probably rock it with a pair of blue jeans.  The pants, however, are not very well designed.  Because the waistband is adjustable they’re always seem to be a bunch of cloth or material in the groin area which gives you very weird. Look like you have a potato sack in front of you.  Probably will not wear the pants at all and will keep the jacket.",

I ordered dark gray in size 2X. My pants fit perfectly and the jacket fit is very good. The 100% polyester material doesn't hang as well as higher quality materials but the cut and overall look of the suit far exceeds its $82.99 price as of this writing.  I like the sewn-in pocket square of the welt pocket on the jacket. That finishes off the jacket well. I think the jacket would look nicer with a two button front instead of a single button. The jacket comes with an extra set of buttons, but instead of being sewn to the inside of the jacket lining, the buttons are inside a plastic baggie that is tied to the collar hanger tab.  Alas, this is a low cost suit that can be carried on vacations and weekend jaunts to be ready for those dress up dinners on cruises, high end hotels and cocktail parties. I can carry this suit without the worry of having a more expensive suit damaged or lost by the airline. The suit still looks nice enough to pass muster at a nice event.  The suit arrived folded and packed into a slide lock plastic bag. The pants are not very wrinkled but the coat has considerable wrinkles that should relax with hanging or mild steaming. I expect to get a lot of use out of this suit. This suit is a very good value at its price point. 5 stars for value.",

I've always had issues with no-name clothing brands sold here, but not with Coofandy.  It's inexpensive, fits well, is usually stylish.  The quality is roughly H&M quality, so not the best quality but you get good quality for what you pay, and that's good enough for me.  This suit is an example of how Coofandy is.  I wear this suit to an expensive beach resort and I look and feel like a guy who just rolled up in an Aston Martin, even though this suit is very inexpensive; I could jump into the pool in this suit and I wouldn't cry about it, while I would never do that in say, one of my Brionis.This suit in Medium is cut for a 40-41 standard chest with R length.  The pants are cut for a 34 waist and 32 length, with expandable elastic built into the waistband, which is one of my favorite features of Coofandy trousers.  I can wear a pair of their trousers knowing it cinches up to me under normal conditions but I can also eat at a buffet and it will just expand comfortably.  The pockets are functional but are stitched closed (you need to open them but I recommend you keep them sewn flat).  There is an inside jacket pocket.  Also note that while there is a lapel pocket, there is a permanent white ""mock handkerchief"" inside of it properly angled to the pocket which looks nice but you can't remove it.  Also note that the jacket is a ONE BUTTON jacket which is very unconventional for suit jackets, making this suit jacket a casual styled jacket.  I would consider this fancy resort wear instead of a formal suit, appropriate for say, beach weddings or photos.",7

I usually dress within a business casual style, with always wearing a blazer, suit or tuxedo. Being that I just listed casual to formal options; you get the idea that I have a bit of flexibility with what I wear and I'm grateful for that. I had been thinking of trying out a regular fit, though slightly slim as in the slacks are raised, suit that is of a reasonable price range. I did not have to look far before choosing the Coofandy brand. I trust this brand to provide me with a lower priced suit that has decent stitching and not drastic inconsistencies with the sewing lines. What i mean by that last observation is often with lower priced suits there will be threading issues witht he shoulders often being the culprit. If you look at the stitching around the shoulders often even with higher prices suits there will be inconsistencies that are barely noticeable but if so indicates the brands attention or lack of to that little detail. Being that i am talking about stitching and unevenness goes to show i have had way too much experience with wearing blazers or suits. I basically partially live in a suit, or a more casual variation with a less fancy sport coat, so my opinions about the lower priced options hold a good deal of validity based on experience. I was not at all surprised to find this traditional fir suit from the Coofandy brand fitting just right. As I have said many times, when it comes to non-tailored suits, you want to find a brand that fits within the regular sizes of small through extra larges, then stay with it. That is if you are lucky enough to have a brand like this that works well with your suite size. This solid color dark grey suit boarders on black and really can pass for either color. It was difficult for me to choose the color because there were so many to choose from. This is just a 2-piece suit, but I am actually happy it's like that, because I do not always wear a vest. The slacks are comfy and work well with my waist. These fit like a 33 waist but also can pass for 34. I wear anything from 34 to 32 so this fit is actually kind to my waist. I can tell the blazer is going to last me a long time. With the slacks the stitching seems good but the coat is more promising in that it seems like I will still have it five years from now. I am again impressed with the Coofandy brand and have never been let down by them. This two-piece suit is fantastic.",8

The tailoring and materials are both of good quality.  The pants have a lot of waist adjustments which I don’t really need- they seem a tad short perhaps.  But as pictured in the product listing with tennis shoes are a good length.  The only downside is that - as received and packed - this set will need pressing before wearing.  I was hoping it would be good to go out of the package.  Overall though - a nice casual and versatile suit for a great price.,2
