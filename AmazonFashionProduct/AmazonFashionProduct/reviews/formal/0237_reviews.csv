I wish I had more places to wear it! Ended up buying it in black to hopefully wear it again! I was very self conscious because I’ve recently gained a ton of weight compared to where I was and this skirt made me feel so thin! I am petite and curvy, so this sat pretty high up, and fit naturally at my curves with a little flare at the bottom. The fabric looks so nice, but my sisters dog pawed at me and it did snag. So be careful with that! However, it did iron nicely, so if it looks wrinkly when you get it, just an iron on low will do! Seriously, get the skirt!",

For reference I am just over 5'7"" tall and weigh 175 lbs.  I like a 32"" inseam on slacks.  The picture, and caption, indicated this was a maxi skirt and should have been at least ankle length.  However, the skirt measured only 36"" long from the waist.  It hit me a coupole of inches above my ankle, and that length looks disproportionate on me.  There were comments re the elastic on the waistband.  The elastic is 1 1/2 inches wide and sewn down at the side seams.  I do not believe that if I had kept it that I would have had any problem/issue with the elastic ""rolling"" on me.  I ordered the dark green which is truly a very dark green--no emerald, yellow, etc. hues to it.  I scrunched it in my hand and there were no resulting wrinkles.  Other than the length on me, I would recommend this skirt.",

The black wasn’t lined so I didn’t expect this color to be, and I was fine with that because it’s a nice thickness of satin… but the lining ups the value for me. The color is divine, the fit is exactly the same as the black… hugs me nicely …in a flattering way, and it’s soft, nice thickness, doesn’t wrinkle while wearing and it’s comfortable enough to wear all day. Whether you pair it with a black turtleneck, throw on a simple tunic or dress it up with blouse and belt, it’s a great all around skirt, perfect for any special occasion or simply shopping, lunching, or a Friday night movie at home!",4

The length is much shorter than 37"" on the ""brown skirt"" and even shorter on the gold/brown/tan (can't tell what color it is) ""skirt."" Both skirts are very tight, despite the fact that I checked the size charts for the garment measurements. The fabric is thick, but it feels like cheap polyester and looks like cheap polyester. It's impossible to even determine what color they are. The bottom of the skirts do not have a trumpet flare as pictured. In fact, the skirt pictured is an a-line skirt with a thin waistband that is clearly visible. The skirts have invisible elastic waistbands that aren't stitched down.
