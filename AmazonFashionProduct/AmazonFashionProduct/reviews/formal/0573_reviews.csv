My daughters love them. They feel nice, fit well, and look pretty. But in 3 out of 4 of this kind, the trim has started to pull away (see picture), and there is nothing you can do to stop it. The first one did this  after only 1-2x wearing it. It went to the “momma fix it” pile, but I really couldn’t fix it. The fabric is just too thin to sew it back. I eventually cut off the entire trim on that part, which of course makes it all frayed, but my daughter loved that dress and for what we paid, I really wanted her to be able to wear it more. Since then we’ve had 2 more pull apart like this. I really wanted to come back and buy more for this season/new sizes, but I just can’t spend this much on something that won’t last. I would only recommend this dress if you need it for one specific occasion. Don’t expect it to last after that.",2

She said she could at least tolerate wearing it for family pictures (because it is pretty!). But I kept pulling at the front, thinking it was jumbled underneath.  As it turns out the seam at the empire waist is sewn very poorly. It creates an unflattering bunch that makes her look pregnant.

Frankly, I think it’s fancier than anything I own myself! The details are lovely, from the tiers and the flared sleeves to the shimmery gold lines throughout and the neat tie at the neck. My daughter is 6, but since she’s very tall for her age I expected the 6-7 size to fit her well, but it’s a bit too big. I’ll happily save it for a year or two until she grows into it!",
Daisy Flower,Pretty but thin,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17IUQQ9DJJLD7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D44WBMBB,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 2, 2023",Size: 8-10 YearsColor: Navy Blue,,"This is a pretty dress that matches the pictures exactly. It’s very thin, breezy material which is good for spring or fall. It has pretty golden accents running along it which adds a touch of sparkle. The shoulders run a bit small though. I ordered a size 10 for my slim 8 year old who typically wears size 7/8. The shoulders fit her perfectly but the sleeves are quite long and the waist is so big it looks like she’s drowning in the dress. I fear once she’s grown enough for the dress to fit her better though the shoulders will be too small. Thus the reason why I only gave it 4 stars.",
Brandi,Beautiful dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VF3IKOFE3WHC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D44WBMBB,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 18, 2023",Size: 8-10 YearsColor: Navy Blue,,"This is a beautiful and well constructed dress. Just what I would expect from a Grace Karen dress. My daughter is 50 inches tall and the dress comes a few inches below her knees. Although the length gave her room to grown the top part of the dress looked too big and the length of the sleeves extended over her hands. I get her bigger dresses because she is very tall for her age but I think I would have been able to get away with the 7-8. Overall nice dress, she’ll just have to wait to wear it!",

Liz Lemonade,Runs a Bit Larger Than Other Grace Karin Dresses,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA6G480FDGMZ8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D44WBMBB,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 14, 2023",Size: 6-7 YearsColor: Khaki,,"This is just lovely, and my daughter loves wearing it. It's a bit too large on her, but we like it enough that I'm going to purchase a second one in a smaller size to wear for family pictures. Compared to the other Grace Karin dresses we've tried (and loved) this one runs a little large. The pattern and fabric are gorgeous, and the metallic thread makes it a bit shiny and special.",
