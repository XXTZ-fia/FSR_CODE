I would have given this review 5 stars, but unfortunately, all the reviews I read about the size chart is absolutely correct. I did as everyone suggested and ordered a larger size; happy to say it fits great. I encourage you to do the same unless you're borderline anorexic.  Keep in mind that these kind of suits will always running snug to give you the slimmest look possible. I'm 6'2""/ 225 lbs, and i ordered a size XXL. If you're anything larger than this or want a less slimming fit, i suggest going for an XXXL.  Hope this helps",16
