If you do have that classic pear shape where your tony on the top and then have a big bottom and hips I would say skip this because that overlay won’t do you any favors. But if your like me and Cary weight in your stomach and upper body as well then this is quite flattering. Overalll not bad, but also not my favorite.",

It’s not high quality or luxury, since it’s almost all Polyester, but it is a loose fit, comes with a jacket that is more like a large shawl with armholes that you can take off and has a beautiful neckline. It’s very flowy. I ordered the Light Blue, and it is true to color. I really like it!",

At first I had a hard time zipping up the dress but it was stuck on some of the flowy fabric getting caught in the zipper. I found that the dress was just a tad bit tight in the upper middle part. This fabric is also kind of warm for me. I have to wait till winter to see how warm it remains.  I love the color and how lightweight it is. The fabric is made of a polyester chiffon .  I recommend this pretty dress.,

First, this is a perfect dress for an outside wedding or a summertime wedding because it is so light and airy it will keep you cool. It is a two-piece so you can take that cover-up off and wear it as a sleeveless dress. The dress fits as expected, I did not wash it before I Wore it. This will be a perfect dress for Church or for a wedding. I did not have any problems with any unraveling of strings, so it was made very well. I think it is a great price.",

Kim S.,Was pleasantly surprised by the look of this dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBE3NE3V0FR1J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D89Y88D3,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 13, 2024",Color: BlackSize: 24 Plus,,"I am usually fairly skeptical about clothing purchased online. Usually, the fit isn't right or the image isn't the same as the actual product. But this dress is really nice! For anyone with a plus sized body, this is very flattering. It has a top portion that is a cross cut look across the mid section. This is great for drawing the eye away from the tummy area.  The inner lining is soft and comfortable and the outer lining is a sheer material. Overall the dress hangs very nicely and has wonderful movement. The neckline has a sequin-like adornment which gives the dress a more formal look. The dress is sleeveless but it comes with a sheer jacket as well. If you're wearing this to a wedding, it will be great to have the ability to take the jacket off if you get warm.  Lovely dress and so glad I purchased. Well worth the price and I finally have a black dress I can keep in the closet for any nice occasion.",
