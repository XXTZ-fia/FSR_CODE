I’m so disappointed My size and weight are deceiving. I tried to change my size profile. I’m only 125 Lbs. The red is so pretty and shiny, I bought it for a party. For me since I’m bigger on top and smaller past my waist, and on bottom, it has no wiggle room. I’m 60, and no longer have a 28” waist. I ordered 2-sizes up. I either going to order a 12 in the dress, because it is small on ME - not flattering. I tried it on once, and it was like I had to pour myself into the dress and that is not comfortable for me. Even 10 years ago, it would’ve been fine but things change. My weight, height, and my dimensions sound like I should have ordered a 10. It will probably be safer for me to go with a new cocktail, shirt, and jacket and wear some leggings and sparkle up my outfit. For formal wear, I’m very picky and can fit into a size 10 shirt mostly. I read all the reviews, and I really wanted to love this dress. I love dresses, and they’re so much easier to wear; I wear summer dresses a lot. I’m always a size 10. I guess it’s back to putting a full-outfit together. This is made to hug your body, but don’t want to look like a big “bear-hug.” Beautiful dress & color, quality is nice for price.

After just trying it on I’m still finding sequins all over the place. The fit is a little small on this dress relying on the stretch of the fabric versus the actual size which also causes the sequins to fall off everywhere. It’s just doesn’t have the high quality feel that most Grace Karin pieces have. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this dress as it just isn’t well made or fit.,2

When I saw this dress, my first thought were boots. However a little long for me so I plan on hemming it. This dress is great quality and perfectly made.",

A single mastectomy left me with one breast (pictured) and because of that, my clothes tend to look strange on me or gather up on one side. I take this into consideration when I write reviews on clothes.  That being said, this dress is phenomenal! It is an entire vibe. GRACE KARIN knocked the ball out of the park with this one! The dress complemented my deformed body, highlighting my curvaceous hips. I can only imagine how beautiful this would look on a normal body type. If you're looking for a sign, here it is: GET THE DRESS!! It's well worth the price tag (which is $55.99 at the time of this review) and I highly recommend it to all of the elegant ladies out there.",28
Amazon Customer,Sequin Dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M3DR4EMGVKUQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D83ZJ6T5,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 21, 2024",Color: BlackSize: 18,,I got this dress thinking it was glitter. I seem to have over looked the sequin part. I don't like sequin as they are hard to maintain and never look good on me. However once I tried it on it actually turned out better than I thought it would. The sequin seemed sturdy and intact. The dress is long and has a good length. The split goes up a decent height but not too much. The dress is very comfortable and actually stretchy where I have some extra room. It's not too tight and hugging me and preventing me from breathing like most formal wear does. One issue I could see is the adjustable straps is in the back. You would have to adjust the dress before you put it on. Other than that I do like the dress.,13

The fit was perfect for me - super stretchy and shows my curve.  It's also very soft and comfortable. The length is perfect for me too, showing my ankles with a one-side slit extending to the mid-calf. The inner lining of the fabric was smooth and comfy. I'm quite happy with how the dress looks, it's really fantastic! The only issue I'm concerned is how to clean it - with so many cute sequins I wouldn't want to ruin them in a washing machine. I guess it's better be hand washed, but it's also a heavy dress.",
