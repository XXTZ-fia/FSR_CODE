SIMPLY LIVING HAPPY,Slightly oversized but good quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AXN50I42S9SR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJRNTTGX,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: Wind RedSize: Small,Verified Purchase,I am 5’7” 135lbs and typically wear a small/2. I ordered a small which fit well in the sleeves but a little too broad across the shoulders and torso. The color is a nice cranberry but I was hoping for a true burgundy a bit deeper and a little more purple. I wish the fit was better too because the material is very soft and a good weight that could hold the structure of the sweater well if it wasn’t so big. I love the buttons and pockets. It’s a great piece that could be dressed up with slacks or down with jeans or over a dress. Please make an XS option.,

I was so excited when it came. I opened it up immediately and put it on, and it felt really really wonderful very soft, high quality, and then I hung it on a hanger to let the wrinkles relax. Several days went by and I would look at it and the wrinkles continued to not disappear. Then I tumbled it in the dryer on fluff for a while, (I never washed it FYI) to see if the wrinkles would disappear. When I removed it, many of the wrinkles had relaxed, but I noticed that there was a stripe of color that looked like a wrinkle, but actually was a dark Discoloration in the knit fabric. I was disappointed as I love this sweater. So I returned it and asked for another, to replace it. It came promptly and I opened it, and this time noticed immediately the same discoloration in the knit fabric. I sent it back immediately , I don’t think I’ll order another in this color, as it appears to be an issue with this NAVY color. Note: I also purchased this same sweater in the apricot color and did not have the same problem with discoloration, it is also wonderful and I kept it.",2
