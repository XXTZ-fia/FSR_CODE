I probably should have gotten the medium.  Anyway, the fabric is very nice and I like the way the shoulders hang.  I guess if I changed anything it would be the bulkiness of the waist.  I think it makes my waist look a little bigger due to the extra fabric gathered there.  Other than that, it’s a beautiful dress.",5

This dress has an imperial waist, side slit & the shiny looking places on the dress are considered burnout places. This dress fits according to the size chart provided. You can wash this at home in cold water and hang to dry. I recommend this dress to others.",

(There is a bit, just not a lot.) According to the chart, my waist is a Medium while by chest is an XL; I split the difference and went with the L. I should have gone with the XL because while the dress fits loosely around the middle, the chest is on the tighter side and being that it is an empire waist... well, it looks weird on me. On the right body type, this would be an absolutely gorgeous dress - and look just so stunning. The dress itself is well made, with nice even stitches and clean lines; there just isn't a lot of give in it for curvier figures.",4
