Paul K.,"Nice shirts, but inconsistent between styles",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MPOJ5GDAO68U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXT5NP9,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 4, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Navy Blue-pure,Verified Purchase,"I originally purchased one of the solid blue shirts because I wanted a shiny shirt to wear during the summer and these had favorable reviews. I'm 5'10"" and my first order was in size large because I usually buy shirts in that size. I found the large to be too big, it wore like a dress shirt that needs to be tucked in and came down over 2/3rds of the way into the groin area when a lot of websites say about half way is where you should be. I felt like I was wearing a giant bag instead of a shirt and it looked bad tucked in because I wanted to use it as a casual shirt not a dress shirt. I donated the large and ordered a medium instead which was perfect. The shirt looked good, fit well and only went down roughly as far as a large elsewhere would.  I liked the blue one so much that a few weeks later I ordered the solid red version in medium. Again, it looked good and was comfortable and going 1 size down was the right option for me. A family member asked me where I was getting these fancy shirts and convinced me that I would probably look nice in the green version with the leaf patterns so I ordered one of those in medium.  I had to return the green one. There are a few things with the patterned version that I don't like compared to the solid ones. First of all, the pattern is actually different fabric than the rest of the shirt and it's sewn in as part of the shirt and not a separate layer on top. This would be fine, except the fabric for the pattern is not soft and silky smooth like the rest of the shirt and it actually feels slightly rough. You can feel the roughness of the pattern on the inside of the shirt while you wear it, the solid color is much more comfortable. The other problem is the green version actually felt smaller than the other two solid ones I bought. I compared them side-by-side and they are basically the same height, but the sleeves are narrower and they aren't stretchy like the solid version is, I think this is because the pattern fabric sewn into the sleeves is also not slightly elastic like the shiny fabric is. The sleeve and shoulder area felt tighter in general and I was worried if I kept it that I would accidentally tear it. If the pattern had just been printed on top of the silky fabric instead of being sewn in place of it the shirt would have been more comfortable inside and might have some stretchiness to it in the seam areas that the current version lacks. The button on the sleeve is just for decoration, the sleeves cannot be unfastened for more room. Also every shirt came with a little plastic bag containing a spare button, but the green one that I returned just came with an empty plastic bag with no button inside. Looking at the two photos I provided, I see the shirt pockets are not consistently placed. It's higher on the blue shirt than the red one, but this might have been a change they made to the design over time and isn't necessarily a quality issue.  One thing to keep in mind if purchasing these is the washing instructions. You can wash them in a washing machine just fine, but it says to hang dry them. I accidentally forgot about this and put the red one into the washer and then dryer when I first got it. It ended up with a handful of dark oily looking spots on the shirt. After washing it a second time and trying the dryer again for a shorter amount of time, the dark spots were in a different pattern elsewhere on the shirt. After a third wash and hanging it to dry there were no dark spots. What I've learned from this is the problem is not really the dryer but direct exposure to heat. With the blue shirt I had followed the instructions the first time and air dried it and there were no spots. Then after wearing it the first time I just threw it into the dryer with the rest of my clothes. I think those acted as a buffer against the heat because that shirt didn't end up with the dark spots. I would recommend either air drying like the instructions say or surrounding it with other clothes if you want to risk the dryer. If you accidentally end up with dark spots, just wash the shirt again and air dry it without heat.  Overall, I like the solid color version of these shirts. They are comfortable and I think they look nice. There are some consistency issues across multiple shirts and the sizing is kind of strange for a casual shirt, but if you get a size that fits you well and you feel comfortable wearing something this flashy in public I think these are a good option.",6
