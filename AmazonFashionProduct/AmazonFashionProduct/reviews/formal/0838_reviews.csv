That would be the only thing I would improve - adding something to cinch the elastic, but I was able to take care of it.  I wish we had a special occasion for him to wear it again, because it looked so great!  I was afraid of the results of washing it, but it washed really well on normal wash and a delicate dry.

Yes, they’re thin, so I know I have to be flexible, but I believe the waist was large for even an average child… like huge!

Sizes are accurate.  This is certainly a slim fit.  The shirt is of fair quality, but needs to be worn with a vest as the pleats do not go all the way down the shirt.  The tie was a huge disappointment. It is only an elastic string that goes around the neck (kinda dangerous).  It can be adjusted by moving the tied knot, but it is far from ideal.  This part was so bad, I bought another multi-pack of ties once I saw it.  The tie that came with the size 7 was for a toddler/baby.
