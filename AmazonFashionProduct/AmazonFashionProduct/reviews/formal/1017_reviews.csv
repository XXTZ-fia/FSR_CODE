D6Blessed,Beautiful!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OYDQ7NN70WAN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6VLTNFS,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 11, 2024",Color: Red MulticolouredSize: 14 Years,,We bought our daughter this dress for a Father Daughter Ball. It was so elegant and comfortable for her. She is wearing the size 9.5 yrs wearing the size 14 so it’s a bit longer on her then the picture shows which made it even more elegant. It was a tad large in the waste but fit the top part well. We tied the bow in the back to help with the fit and it was perfect.,
Ali,Beautiful,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2750CPLV09LV7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6VLTNFS,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 8, 2024",Color: Green MulticolouredSize: 14 Years,,This dress is very pretty. My daughter needed a dress for her winter band concert and this was a perfect find. The iridescent green was very festive and perfect since her school colors are green and black. The length was perfect for a nice concert dress too. My daughters only complaint was that the sequins were a little scratchy under her arms. Otherwise a very nice dress for dressing up in.,
Blanka,Beautiful dress..but not 100% Polyester as described.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP84DKY3255BV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6VLTNFS,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 23, 2024",Color: Rainbow ColorSize: 14 Years,Verified Purchase,"The dress is beautiful, would had been perfect if it was one material as advertised. Purchased the size 14Y for an 8 year old and the length was a maxi length, which is exactly what she wanted. Long and beautiful! So disappointing to see it wasn't 100% Polyester as described on the description box. We cannot wear mixed fabrics due to personal beliefs so we have to return it. Besides the fabric, it is ""beautiful and majestic as a mermaid"" (as she described it).",
PatissierLT,"Beautiful green/blue sequins dress, but arm openings are too big",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU9D91X51VQDO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6VLTNFS,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 18, 2024",,,"-Good quality find -Perfect look and fit, except for the exposure from the large arm openings...my daughter has a very slim build -Well tailored and designed, all sequins seem to be sewn on very well -Non-scratchy and lined well -Medium weight dress -Zipper works well",
Kathryn,Sparkly rainbow party dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FINQAOSWJLV7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6VLTNFS,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 12, 2024",Color: Rainbow ColorSize: 12 Years,,"Even prettier in person! Pleased with the quality. The sequins have stayed put so far. I have only washed this once (as my daughter has only had one occasion to wear it so far) in cold water on a gentle cycle, then hung it up to dry, and there were no issues.  The zipper works well. The button above the zipper isn't the best quality, at least not as nice as the rest of the dress. It feels cheap and isn't attached well, but that's an easy fix.  My daughter says it is comfortable. I ordered her usual size and it runs just slightly big, but that's better than being too small! She can grow into it. The sizing issue isn't so much that it is too noticeable, and the sash/bow around the waist helps make it more snug. Very happy with this colorful, sparkly gown! 5/5",
CB,Beautiful dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCWI4E6D83AC0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6VLTNFS,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 9, 2024",Color: Rainbow ColorSize: 10 Years,Verified Purchase,"My daughter loved it! Ordered it a little to big so she could grow in to it but still looks flattering even if its a little bit big, very good colors, sparkly and pretty. Seems like a good quality dress",

My daughter wore it to a family wedding, and she felt like a princess. The sequins shimmer beautifully without being too over-the-top, and the rainbow color is vibrant yet classy. The fit was perfect for her size, and it was comfortable enough for her to wear all day without any complaints. My daughter enjoyed the wedding and now asks to print the photos with her wearing this dress. Absolutely recommend!",

This Is My Review Name,Absolutely gorgeous,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ8DJB7GP73S5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6VLTNFS,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 21, 2024",Color: Green MulticolouredSize: 14 Years,,"My daughter and I can't get over how absolutely gorgeous this dress is. We ordered size 14 in the green/multicolored, and it is PHENOMENAL. It fit as expected and is so beautiful. My daughter said it was a little bit scratchy, but that's to be expected. (And she wouldn't be wearing it for long anyway.) It's for her upcoming birthday party. :-) She's turning 12 and is almost 5'3"", so the 14 was perfect.",

leahy,It's a Hit!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QYQSFMZ4LQAP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6VLTNFS,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 9, 2024",Color: Green MulticolouredSize: 14 Years,,"My daughter has become very active in orchestra and needs, in her words, ""fancy dresses"" for her concerts. I picked this up on a whim and it is absolutely perfect. I did get the green multicolored as I thought it would look good with her strawberry blonde hair and very fair coloring and I was right, she looks beautiful. I did get it a little bit larger than what she normally wears as she is at an awkward size, between sizes, so she does have a little room to grow this year. I am very happy with it, it is long enough for her to sit for the concerts and be comfortable but not so long that it drags on the floor, just perfect for a young girl (12 years old).",3
Dank,Daughter loves it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20M8NSGCDSNMJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6VLTNFS,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 6, 2024",,,My daughter put this on immediately after it arrived and fell in love with it. It fits really nicely on my slim 10 year old. Could be longer but the midi length is nice for active girls.,
Arthur,Gorgeous Dress for Little Girls,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIQ3WU5VNQY46/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6VLTNFS,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 5, 2024",,,"This little girl just loves the dress. She finds it very comfortable. And it's perfect for twirling! It’s high quality, fully lined, and covered in sequins. I would say it runs true to size. I selected a size 7 for a child who is almost 7 years old. But she is small for her age and so she has room to grow with this dress. This dress is a real treasure.",3
