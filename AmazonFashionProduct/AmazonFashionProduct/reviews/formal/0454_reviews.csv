However, when I did try it on the fit was very off for me. I think that it might have looked better if I was taller or proportion differently. However, I’m 5 feet tall and have a very short upper body, and so the proportions did not seem to work out. I had to return the product. Other than that no complaints.",

The color is great - the product color and selling pics are the same; of course looks better in person.My favorite is the material - I was so shocked.  Its lightweight - but not to thin, soft and is somewhat stretchy, somewhat textured, inside is lined, and has a 'thickness' to it.  The last two combined make it so that it does not outline your panty and bra straps - cannot see them (Note this may change if you wear it very tight / stretched) and also smooths / camouflages things that we are self conscious about.  Muffin top and belly for me.  It wears fit on my form, not super snug.  I love, love love this dress and receive several compliments whenever I wear it. This dress can be dressed up or down, its just great!",29

There were some sporadic knitting pulls noted. The garment appeared clean and free of spills. I typically wear a medium size 6-8-10.  This fit well.

I ended up keeping the large for my mother, she wears a 14/16 in Calvin Klein/Tommy Hilfiger dresses (Calvin Klein dresses are pretty consistent with the sizing).  I was so in love with this dress based on reviews that I purchased the navy in a size large before the three dresses arrived.

This dress is VERY form fitting. I definitely ordered the right size, any larger and it would have been hanging off of me, but the fabric clings to every curve you have. I could clearly see my belly button through the dress. Also if you have a decent amount of cleavage, it won't all be covered, so this dress may not be suitable for work for all body types.",

It fit great when I tried it on and the quality seemed great for the price and it was beautiful. However, when I actually wore it for the first time, it quite literally fell apart. It ripped in two places along the back seam, with one of the holes being about an inch below my butt. Very embarrassing. It also had so many loose threads and snags hanging on it during the first 2 hours of me wearing it that I had to ask a colleague for a pair of scissors because they were so noticeable and bad. I feel like it's important to note that this dress, while form-fitting, was not too tight at all and looked very professional. So, it wasn't my body putting too much stress on the fabric. I also wasn't doing anything crazy that day. I was simply conducting training, so all I was doing was standing up and occasionally walking around. This dress should not have ripped or had that many loose threads from just standing and occasionally walking. I'm really disappointed that I cannot return this because I didn't need to wear it until after a month had passed from purchasing it. It would probably cost more to patch the holes than the dress costs and I honestly wouldn't trust that it wouldn't continue to fall apart in other places, so it looks like it's going in the garbage. :(",
