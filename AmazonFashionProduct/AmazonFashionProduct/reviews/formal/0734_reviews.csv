Momma Beams,So COMFY!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CBR4MD2R0ITR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKMTHJSS,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Color: Dark GreenSize: XX-Large,,"I ordered this dress to expand upon my collection of summer dresses. I’ve also enjoyed just slipping on a dress, an apron, and getting housework done. It definitely helps get the day moving, and makes me feel as though I’ve truly accomplished something. Anyway, this dress is absolutely lovely. The material is so, so soft. To the point where I’d sleep in it, but I don’t want to lose such a cute dress to the nightgown collection. The ruching adds a nice touch, giving a bit of a slimming effect, and the length is great, right down to my feet. The neckline is true to the photos and description, as is the color of the dress. For reference, here are my measurements, and what I ordered:  Ordered XXL Dark Green Bust: 48” Waist: 42” Hips: 56” Body Type: Pear Normal Size: XL-XXL",
Leigh P.,Love This Dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21Y1ZCTG40Y8G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKMTHJSS,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Color: KhakiSize: Small,,"I absolutely love this dress. At first glance, it appears rather simple. But when it's on, it's on! The fabric is very nice and just the right thickness. The top is stretchy and hugs me in all the right places, even making my bust appear much fuller. The armholes are perfect and doesn't show any bra. I love the crew neck, allowing a nice backdrop for any type of necklace. The ruched waist area isn't too ruched that it looks bulky; it's just enough to add detail and possibly hide any tummy lumps if you have any. The length is perfect for me. I'm 5'1"", 115lbs, and the small size falls a few inches above my ankle. Love this!",
SLReviews@NYC,I love everything about this dress. Everything.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OQHFQNLUR94Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKMTHJSS,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: Royal BlueSize: Medium,,"For a start, the color - it's an absolutely beautiful royal blue. Soft fabric as in nightgown soft. Wonderful cut, and hits my waist perfectly, great arm openings - not too loose or tight and the flowy-ness or drape of the skirt is perfection and very elegant without bulk. And can I add: Pockets! Pockets! I was searching for this unicorn of a dress for what seems like forever and finally got it - and wore it immediately to host an informal-formal holiday gathering. It's the perfect ""hostess"" dress in that you can move easily, do not need to iron it, it's comfortable as you are running to and fro/cooking, etc. and the pockets to keep a lip gloss, glasses, tissue. I'm 5'6"" and a usual size 8/10 in a dress and it's the perfect size and length. Absolutely love this dress!",
DJSELF805,Perfect Maxi Dress for Any Occasion!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WT8DT23KV16I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKMTHJSS,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: KhakiSize: Large,,"From the moment you try it on, it'll become a wardrobe favorite. The crew neck design adds a touch of elegance, while the high-waisted cut perfectly accentuates my figure, giving a flattering silhouette.  The fabric is soft, breathable, and lightweight—ideal for warm weather but also easy to layer for cooler days. The dress flows beautifully, and the length is just right, hitting perfectly at my ankles (I’m 5'6""). Whether paired with sandals for a casual day out or dressed up with heels and accessories for a special occasion, it transitions seamlessly.  One of my favorite features is how versatile it is. I've worn it to brunch and even just lounging at home—it works for everything! Plus, it washes well with no shrinking or fading.",

Yami.,This patchwork maxi is perfect for any occcasion!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E9KC019A248V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKMTHJSS,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Color: Lake BlueSize: Large,,"I just got this sleeveless maxi dress and it's become my absolute favorite outfit in no time. The comfort level is off the charts. The fabric feels so nice and soft against my skin. It's one of those dresses you can throw on and just feel good wearing all day long. Perfect for those warm summer days or even layered up with a cute jacket when it gets a bit cooler. The design is super flattering, thanks to the high waisted fit. It really highlights my waist and gives me that lovely silhouette without even trying. The crew neck adds a simple and chic touch, making it easy to dress up or down depending on where you're headed. It's stylish and adds a bit of flair that makes it more than just another plain maxi dress. The versatility is also a win for me. I’ve worn it to brunch with friends, and casual day at the beach. It’s like getting multiple outfits in one!",

Judith,Hides a Poochy Stomach,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SQK8EKWD94A2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKMTHJSS,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",,,"I'm thrilled with this dress! First of all it is a brilliant cobalt blue (which is stunning); so many colors are faded or muddy when you actually see them ... this is gorgeous.  I ordered my size .. (12 = Large) and its the ""fit"" that makes this dress make me go back and buy up more colors before they are all gone!  Look at the Seller's photo ... the seam line between the top and the skirt sits on that model (as it does on me) about 1"" above where my natural waist is ... that means the thickest part .... where the ""gathers"" for the skirt are ....  is ABOVE the waist of the dress, that then falls in soft folds over my poochy stomach (effectively hiding it).  The ruched side-wrapped panel on the front helps with this illusion ---subtly, without looking like a bubble top. The material is a jersey type knit with a bit of stretch in it ... so it hugs your curves, yet the skirt flows down freely ... and BONUS ... two side seam pockets and due to the cut of the top neckline, it is necklace friendly and my bra-straps do not show!  Love it... and you will, too!",
Doris Millar,"Love the Color, Fit, and Feel",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VMPYI3TE63IR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKMTHJSS,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Color: Lake BlueSize: Medium,,"Love the color, fit, and feel of this dress. I have broad shoulders so it's sometimes hard to find dresses that look flattering. This one does.  The fabric gives it a casual look but the ruching along the sides of the bodice makes it a little dressy. The fabric also has a nice weight to it. This makes the gathering at the waste very flattering in my opinion.  I was slightly disappointed with the fabric after washing though. It's a little fuzzy, like the fabric could easily start to pill after a few washes. I washed it in a garment bag on delicate, cold water, and hung it to dry. I didn't notice any shrinking though, nor did the color fade.  I wear a US 8/10 and ordered the medium. It fits perfectly.",

Autumn,On the fence about this dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1B34GKOTHHRX9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKMTHJSS,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Color: Lake BlueSize: Small,,"I have two other dresses from this company and really liked the style and fit of those dresses so I wanted to try this new one. For reference I'm only 5'5 so I ordered the small because I didn't want it to drag on the floor since it's a maxi dress and usually maxi dresses for a person who's 5'5 is too long. This one actually hits a couple of inches above my ankle but I think it's because my wider hips helped raised the length a little. I love the teal color. Sometimes teals are too light for me but this one is a perfect teal color. I think it actually runs slightly big. I don't think this flatters my body shape, the neckline isn't quite crew neck but more of a high square neck line. I don't think this will be high waisted if you are average height like me. It basically hits me at my belly button and had I sized up it would've definitely been slightly lower. I think the elastic would've been more comfortable if it was flat instead of a thin crunchy-like elastic so it feels weird. I guess if you have a body shape that would be flattered by this dress you'll probably love it? I don't know.",

It's comfortable and soft to the touch. The top is rouched at the sides and is very flattering. (My photos don't do it justice because of the angle.) It's a great length for tall gals - it hits just above the ankle on me (5'9"") - and would look even more dramatic on a shorter frame. The pockets are deep and sturdy, easily holding my phone or keys. I like my shoulders covered so I put an undershirt on underneath, and was surprised by how high the neckline was except at the shoulders where it dips out a bit. A great summer dress, or with a long sleeve shirt underneath, it's a super cute winter dress too!",

AnonymousMama,"For Semi-Formal, Maybe...",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR9E8LSZVM0D3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKMTHJSS,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 2, 2025",Color: Dark GreenSize: Medium,,"This is a super-cute dress! I don't like that it's labeled ""formal"", because it's a jersey-knit fabric, which is not fancy, haha. But the design/fit is pretty sophisticated, so I wouldn't wear it casually either. I think this would be best suited for business-casual type situations, like maybe as a guest for a Spring/Summer wedding, or for attending a graduation.  For reference, I'm 5'6"", with measurements at 37-29-41. I typically wear a M in tops and L in bottoms. I decided to order this in a M, and it fits beautifully. The stretch and drape of this fabric is really flattering, and it feels incredibly comfortable, too. I doubt I'll use the pockets, because I don't like the weight pulling down on my dress, but they are a nice enough size for putting my hands into when I'm feeling fidgety. The neckline sits nice - high enough to hide my chest tattoo, but not to the point where it bothers my neck. The arm holes are nice - they don't unnecessarily squeeze out my skin/fat the way some stretch/fitted garments might. The fabric hugs my curves nicely, without revealing any undergarment lines. The waistline sits perfectly on my natural waistline, and the hemline falls just to my ankles. Lovely.",4

At 5'9"" and 160 pounds, with my weight carried in my hips, I was concerned about the fit, but this dress is incredibly flattering, skimming over my hips without drawing undue attention. The fit is lovely, and the overall look is attractive.  The only drawback is the fabric— it wrinkles easily and requires ironing, which is not my favorite chore. I have yet to launder it, but I anticipate it will wash well. If any issues arise, I’ll update my review. For the price, this is a beautiful dress that works well for a variety of occasions.",
Kyounce72,"5' 8"", 132lbs Size Small ordered... nice little dress!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PGLENNQJB08T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKMTHJSS,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 25, 2024",Color: Lake BlueSize: Small,,"My wife owns very few dresses and I was happy to get the chance to help change that with this dress. We actually ordered 3 different dresses all at the same time, and of the 3, this one is the nicest fitting and softest feeling.  The fit was good for my wife (ordered a size SM, she is 5'9"" and 132lbs with hips) and she said it felt comfortable on her. It is soft, and a bit stretchy so there's room to give. Her only complaint (minus a star here) is the bunched area in the stomach section isn't consistent as in the ad pics, so it looks a small bit awkward as you can see in the pictures. She doesn't think it hurts the look too much and says the wearability isn't affected at all.  Personally, as a guy looking at it, I think it needs a little something to break the continuous color up (a belt maybe?), but I think the drape is nice on her figure and it compliments her curves well... but I'm a dude, what do I know? ;)  Based on wearing it out last night (with a belt which helped, so I knew a little) she's of the opinion that it was comfortable for the 4 or 5 hours she was in it, and she got compliments on the look. SO she says she'd recommend it for the $33 it'll set you back! 4 Stars!",4
