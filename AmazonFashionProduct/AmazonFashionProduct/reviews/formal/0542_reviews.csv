It’s breathable comfortable and durable. However mine arrived with several buttons barely sewn on and threads coming off. As a result I lost 4 of the buttons within 4 hours and the first one came off just from trying the shirt on. Gave it the benefit of the doubt and sewed it back on myself so I could wear it. But still lost 3 others.,

Michael the designer,"A beautiful sexy shirt, that even a well kept 70 year old can sport!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27YMAA8TJ5UFT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXWDTDN,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 13, 2024",Color: BlackSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I am 6'4"", at 195lbs, and the XL fit just fine. I would normally order a size large, but the XL just fit my broad shoulders. A hard lucky guess On-Line. The body runs wider than the fit of most shirts, which is good because the design of the shirt should have a blousy elegant look. I was trying to go for a large black shirt, as I intend to wear a black leather blazer over. I ended up happy with the XL, as my arms are quite long, and the drape of the shirt would not look as fine as it does. I purchased my black leather blazer thru Amazon,BGSD, ($199+) and now this beautiful shirt. I added black retro shoes from AMAZON again, (Cole Haan ($108) ),on sale. I also wear Amazon jeans (20+I guess). The fit is like my Calvin's, but the price is ...so much less!  Ok, take a chance , you have a month to decide, and I'm pretty sure your better half will love this., (just say'n). This is one of the finest outfits I have ever put together.  When I walked out to the mailbox today everyone, yes everyone, who walked by me stopped to tell me how great I looked. When you reach 70, anyone who pays a compliment makes a GREAT day, extra complements feels like the Lottery! Great shirt, nice buttons, nice fit. The length is good and long, and the cut makes the floral pattern stand out. When light casts across the shirt, the illuminated areas are covered with floral design, and the other designs fade back into the black background. This shirt looks great under a black leather blazer. Do not hesitate, the material is quality, and the drape looks so good across the chest! This shirt feels freaking awesome! Guys, take a chance, you have a month to decide, I know you're better half will love it😍 If she has ever looked at a romance novel, she will see you.. wearing this s*xy shirt saving the damsel (her) . So, if you're looking to turn up your game..this is a very fine place to start.",8
