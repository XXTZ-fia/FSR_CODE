The sleeves are unique and add a feminine touch.  I am more than satisfied with this purchase.,9

Except, I struggle with what is appropriate to wear now? I feel like I shouldn't dress too young, but I don't want to look like a frump either. Sadly, this top made me feel like a frumpy old woman. It wasn't flattering. It hung like a square box on me, and I felt like the top part went up to high on my chest. Not my style for sure. The color was nice and the sleeves were feminine, but I couldn't wait to take it off and return it. I'm 5'5 and about 160. I have a muscular build and a 36c bust.
