On the bright side, caring for this blouse is a breeze – simply wash on delicate in cold water and either hang dry or use the air setting on your dryer.

This EVALESS Long Sleeve Shirt has a very narrow collar with a V neck in the center. There are no buttons in the front but it does have a seam from top to bottom in the center. The sleeves are long and full and have buttoned cuffs at the wrists. The shirt can either be worn tucked in or outside as it has a squared bottom shape to it.  Being the fact that it is sheer and not lined you will need to wear a camisole or tank top underneath it to keep from over exposure. The blouse is light weight and will be a great spring and summer time blouse.  It comes in a variety of colors and sizes. I ordered the pink color which is a very pretty bubble gum pink and I ordered my normal size and it fit's perfectly. I did machine wash it on gentle in cold water with no fabric softener and laid it flat to dry and it turned out great.  If you're looking for a beautiful sheer blouse you may want to consider this one.,

The top itself is decent enough.  It is fairly sheer in this color, and I had to wear a tank under it.  The sleeves are very long.  I went with XXL but usually wear an XL, and I probably could have just ordered the accurate size, as it is a bit large.  I prefer loose tunic tops, so that doesn't bother me too much, but if you are an XL, just order XL.  The wrinkles steamed out very easily, and I wore it around for a bit, sitting down, and it did not wrinkle up like some sheer tops would, so I would wear this when I travel.

The only issue I have is that the material is extremely lightweight and see-through.  I'll have to wear a camisole or sleeveless shell under this.  This arrives in a vacuum-pack so you will definitely need to pull out the iron before wearing it.  I had this blouse hanging in my closet for more than a week, hoping the wrinkles would dissipate. That didn't happen until I pulled out an iron.  Because of the synthetic fabric, I had to take extra caution ironing it as the material will scorch easily.  I do like the style -- it's very flattering with slacks, especially the simple collar.  The sleeves have a nice length to them.  This garment can be washed, per instructions on the label.",4

The only disappointment I have is the care instructions it can be machine washed but it needs to be hung to dry.  Unfortunately when I did this some of the laundry detergent remained on the shirt and it came out pretty wrinkled.  I can use a wet cloth to remove the soap residue but I’m concerned with using an iron because the material is so delicate.  I may try a quick tumble in the dryer on low to see if that works.  I should also mention that I’m 5’5” and 150lbs and my usual size is a medium, I ordered a medium in this shirt and it fit quite well, so it’s pretty true to size.

I am 5’4”, 125 lbs and ordered a small. There is a lot of extra material lengthwise for me to tuck in, as it fits me more like a tunic than a regular top.

When we pulled it out and looked at it we were disappointed with the wrinkly mess that came out. After a wash and dry we are able to look at it again with fresh eyes. This is a nice blouse that fits nicely and looks good. The fabric, while easily wrinkled, is nice and soft. They really need to package it better so it makes a better first impression.",
