Mommyto3,All Tags Placed Outside,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SUOVR9YYZX6S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4ZCM37S,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Color: Black StripeSize: Large,,Unfortunately I misplaced the package and missed the return ability. Months later I decided to throw in the wash and went to remove the paper tags. I realized the brand tag at the neck was sewn externally. I then discovered the care label was also external. I reached out to Amazon chat and a phone call for a possible courtesy return still. Chat was willing to help but they couldn’t get the label to work so I was transferred to a call. That rep didn’t understand I guess this won’t be restockable to sell because it’s got flaws. I had to pay a restock fee which was deducted from my return. I’ll probably see it at my local liquidator store in a few months…..🙄,

It's a synthetic but I'm happy to say the viscose feels much softer and cozier than a typical poly blend! Really warm and just feels thick and wonderful. Perfect for fall weather.  Style-wise I think it leans a little younger than most classic crewnecks, which maybe won't be right for everyone but feels PERFECT for my vibe. The stripes feel timeless but I like that the ""inside out"" seam details create a less preppy and more fashion-forward feeling. I love feeling pulled together but not stuck up and this sweater catches that effortless-but-polished thing. The boxy and roomy fit give it a ""boyfriend sweater"" feeling but with a modern edge, so it's really easy to style.  The yellow stripes on the green-and-yellow sweater are a warm and vibrant golden yellow. I think it's an awesome color combo. It's kind of tricky finding stripes that read as lively and fresh without being garish, but this can actually stand up to the contrast of my bright ginger hair without washing me out!  Distinctive but not too trendy, and nobody I know has one quite like it. This is absolutely gonna be a signature piece for me this autumn.",2

I was hoping it would have a little more of a cream color than a white color but I would say it is just a tad bit over white. Maybe some would call it ""winter white"" or maybe Breyer's Ice Cream Vanilla. I don't look good in bright white and this isn't bright white. I guess all that doesn't matter because I may be the most picky white wearer ever but it's so hard to know what color you are really going to get when you order online. It's good.

It states is has casual outside seams, which I am not opposed to However, this sweater just didn't seem to be the right type for that kind of stitching. It is a baggy sweater, which is fine, the length was good, but the sleeves were a bit too long for my liking.  The outside seams did not seem to be sewn together very well, and one of the sleeves, where they attach to the sweater had a slight hole in it from poor stitching. The neck was not smooth and also seemed to have some sewing glitches in it. They weren't horrible, but they just take away from the look.  I give this sweater three stars. It is fine to wear out to run errands, but I wouldn't wear it to work or some sort of occasion with others.",

It's soft, and I like the color. I wouldn't call it beige like the description says, it's more of an off-white, but it looks like the photos and the off-white is the color I really wanted, so I'm happy with it! It can go with nearly any color of pants. Yes, a lot of the seams are on the outside, and this is on purpose! You can see it on the product photos, and it's the style. It is not sewn wrong! If you don't like that style, don't purchase this. I have another sweater from a different brand that is a very similar style, and I prefer this new one more. Cons - This sweater is a little cropped, and I wish it was a tad longer. It's also somewhat boxy in the body and baggy in the arms, again, this is the style. I don't think it looks bad, but I would prefer it to be a bit less boxy and slightly less baggy sleeves. I ordered my normal size, and I'd say it fits mostly true to size other than being a little boxy/baggy like I said. I may have been able to size down. Overall, I do like it, and I'm excited to wear it with jeans, colored pants, leggings, at home, to work, etc. when the weather gets cooler!",3

On one side the stitching was white and obvious and the other it was more closely stitched together. A bit inconsistent in the stitching from sleeve to sleeve.,

But then I realized what was going on....it was sewn/tagged backwards. For the tags to be inside, the seams are then outside and vice versa. If I turn it inside out so that the seams are inside, the tags show. In the photo of my shoulder and mirror you can see that the shoulder seam is flat but behind me the tag shows.
