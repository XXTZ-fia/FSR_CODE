Renee  Miles,not off the shoulders,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3H0RNT8HMU5O5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CF25K6FL,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Coffee,Verified Purchase,"It feels soft, size is perfect, material is so thick but not hot the shoulders just didn’t come down on me for some reason it was like a turtle neck i wanna keep it but it looks weird. but i know my husband would love this material and my ass looked great in it. so sad to send it back 🥲",
Jessica,Comfortable but static-y!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BF3UELD6M3T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CF25K6FL,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I read a lot of the comments before buying so I was a bit hesitant but I’m glad I did! It’s super comfortable. Really soft fuzzy material. The downside to the material is that it’s that super static material. Holy Moly I was shocking myself putting it on hahah. But it fits well! I’m in the process of losing weight and currently 233lbs and 5’7”. Not exactly sure my size but I’ve been between L and XL, so I bought the XL just to make sure it would be flattering and not tight.  It looked smallish when I pulled it out of the package but it’s sooo soft and stretchy it fit great and very flattering. The neck is turtle neck and looks great just like that, you can also pull it down to go over the shoulders but the original form is essentially a turtle neck so it doesn’t stay down if you are moving around. But that’s fine because it looks great both ways. It’s thick enough to be warm and not see through but lightweight enough to not make you sweat. Excited to wear this as a winter dress. A few people commented on it being ok the shorter side, and yes I agree it is, but that’s exactly what I wanted. It’s hard to find dresses in my size that aren’t made granny length. This flatters you and still covers the goods. Wearing it indoors with heels, but pairing with fleece tights to wear outdoors! I recommend!",2

Lisa Rose Dubosque,The fabric will not allow the top to stay folded on top.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROMKERAS4DOMC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CF25K6FL,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Ok_ the material A+ The stretchyness A+ The concept A+  However- major design fail!!! I can’t believe for this price they down sew the top of the dress down so that it stays in place off your shoulders. Instead, the stretchy fabric just flys u the second you line your arms at all. Clearly no one wants to wear something out that they would have to keep their arms glued to their sides ( impossible ) or you will constantly have to keep pulling at your Shirt to fit right. ( annoying)  So —- because I liked the look and fabric of The dresses, I opted to keep them and sew the stops down into place by lining up the seams and stitching them in a bunch of places.. I don’t know how long or how many washes that will hold but at least I got it to stay put ..  I shouldn’t have had to do That tho…",

I ended up ordering a L and wanted to see if maybe it fit a bit better. The M and L are the same exact dress! The tags don't even have a size on them. So I would say this is more of a 1 size fits most they're isn't a actual size. Other then tht it's amazingly soft but not super thick but thick enough. It just doesn't sit like in the modeal above. The piece of fabric on the shoulders does NOT stay either i will have to sew it to stay. In my photos I have the large on the left and medium on the right and the next photo of the medium on top of the large.,8

Jacinda Rodrigues,Not sure,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GFCWSNV1779E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CF25K6FL,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 11, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Beige,Verified Purchase,I bought this for my birthday and I love the quality of the dress and how soft it is. My only issue is the over the shoulder part does not stay down. It starts to look like a turtle neck dress… I’d size up if you are more on the thicker side like me. It also already started to rip once I put it on. The seams of the folded over part are loose and will come undone if you try to move it around too much. Thinking about returning it :(,2

The material is soft. Sooooooo soft. Too soft that it makes the top part not stay down. You would have to sew it down to keep it from rolling up constantly.  It was super cute and i wanted this to work so bad but it simply won’t stay put because of the fabric they used and the lack of tacking stitches,2

So, when I wore it out, I wore leggings and boots so it could ride up and hug my curves properly and that got rid of that boxy look but obviously made it shorter and it barely covered my bum. It's a flattering dress and the off the shoulder bit looks really cute. If you have a smaller build, I think it would accentuate where you want it to, and the fabric is thick enough it helps hide the small flaws.
