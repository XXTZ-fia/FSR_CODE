There's probably a good 6"" under my feet, so I will have to hem them for sure. The fabric is smooth and comfortable against the skin.

The photos make it look smooth at the top of the waist, but it's bunchy elastic that stretches and somewhat smooths out when you wear it. It is tighter than I prefer as I don't like snug anything along my torso. The tightness of the band squeezes my waist causing lumps where there isn't any.

The material is nice and soft- they are very long- that works well for me- I am 5'7 with a short torso and long legs.  Beware of camel toe.  lol... okay, I said it.  They are nice but miss the mark for me!",

Anna,Thick and luxurious feeling pants!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG6LV25ETBH67/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF3T7P9P,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 3, 2024",Color: DarkbrownSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I am genuinely surprised how good of quality these pants are. I was expecting thin, leggings type of pants, however these are medium thick, not see through at all, high waisted, stretchy and very comfortable & luxurious feeling. I got the chocolate brown, and it is beautiful, exactly what you'd imagine chocolate brown to be. I love the pleated lines on both legs, it gives it an elegant and classy look.  I am 5 ft 3 inches and weight 155 pounds, medium fits great.  These pants are amazing and look expensive! I've gotten compliments from friends and coworkers. They are so surprised these are from Amazon, they thought these were designer pants. So definitely worth the money!!  Get them!!",20
Sweet T,Fantastic!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MKO2SQVQ1ZV3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF3T7P9P,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 28, 2024",Color: Pea GreenSize: X-Large,,"I really didn't think this would be as nice as they are. They're thick, good quality, well fitting and don't squeeze my post hysterectomy belly! The color is great. The pintuck makes these wearable at work on a casual business day. I really hate that there's no pocket but I can see why there aren't due to the design, shape and fabric. The downside is that they're going to show any wrinkle or pantyline underneath.",
zoila,More like workout pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11AL78JIUPNKN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF3T7P9P,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 28, 2024",Color: BlackSize: X-Large,,I’m not a fan of the material.. it’s not flattering at all. I probably should’ve gotten a size down for more tummy control but then they would’ve been too short. They are long. Not recommended for short people. I don’t think I can wear this for work except exercise or just lounge pants. Not a big fan,15
Teaira Charlton,Tall girl friendly and so comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FDCB6YNR3ZMS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF3T7P9P,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 21, 2024",Color: DarkbrownSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"OQQ is already one of my favorite brands for their compression work out attire. The quality is beyond exceptional. However, I was nervous about the transition to multipurpose workout attire but they did what they needed to do ! If you’re a girl that loves her leggings and work out attire but also need to look professional before or after the gym then these are for you! AND they are tall girl friendly!!! I will definitely be purchasing every color 😊",53
