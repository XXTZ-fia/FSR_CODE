I really wanted to like this jacket. First, I bought size Small and was kind of too tight in underarms; however, due to soft and stretchy fabric, it could work with sleeveless tank and it feels really good. I received a jacket in size S and it so deformed; I was not sure if I need to try to make it shaped because was not sure in final results it could be even worse shape. I wanted to try size Medium, ordered and received in a better shape but still little wrinkled so need to do some ironing and it is not guarantee a good result. I have decided to do not even try. Size Medium is too big for me. Both times I tried Grey color which is I really like on a picture; agree with many, it is more tan and it is still ok color will go with many things. Trying to compare, I found a tiny hole on a Jacket in size S; so definitely returned. Still was thinking on size Medium; next day returned. This jacket is a really nice idea; however, something should be improved to keep shape and send a product in an appropriate condition. For reference, I am 5.1, 128 -130 lb; if I keep, size Small fits me better.",7
