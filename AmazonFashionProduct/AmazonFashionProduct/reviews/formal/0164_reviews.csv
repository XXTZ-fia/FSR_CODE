Over a couple of washings, I haven’t noticed any problems - it doesn’t seem to loose or transfer color in the cold wash, and the fabric still feels the same.

Win2000,Soft and Nice Looking Shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GM7YM1LLP9DA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPPLS9VJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 11, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Navy Blue,,This shirt is a very dark navy blue. The material is a soft and silky feeling and seems to have a little bit of stretch to the material. I ordered a size (M) and it fits true to size. Had a large pronounced collar and seems like this could be worn with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a nice pair of slacks as well. A nice value for the money. I haven't worn it yet other than trying it on and haven't washed/dry cleaned it yet so I don't know how it will hold up b I would have no problem recommending this shirt.,2

A shirt collar very often determines how the shirt looks in general, especially one billed as a ""dress shirt"", and when it's just loose and floppy, it's hard to wear it under a sport jacket and have it look nice. Maybe I could wear it on the beach as just a very casual shirt???",2

It fits just right, and is well tailored for my build.  Other shirts I've had that were not slim fit tend to have too much material around the waist.  This one is much cleaner looking.  I was pleased to see that while it is thin like other dress shirts, it is not so thin that you can see things through it.  Also, fresh out of the package I expect creases, which it had, but compared to other shirts it didn't have many.  I take that as a good sign that it won't get as easily wrinkled.Also, it feels really nice.  Good material choice, nice fit.  Recommended!",2

I have purchased some at a premium price, such as &Collar, Nautica and JF J. Ferrar in JC Penney. So when I saw the price of this one, I told myself: ""Yeah, yeah. Whatever. These more likely will not have quality or 4 way stretch"". Well, I was wrong. The fabric is not only 4 way stretch, but it's also more comfortable than the Stretch Shirts I mentioned earlier. It also looks like if it was tailor made. The collar is not as wide as the Charles Tyrwhitt Shirts, but it still looks elegant with a tie. I ordered the blue one and I will order other colors, not only to attend our meetings regularly, but also for casual use during the week.",

He doesn't like slim-fit shirts and can't wear his normal size, but he isn't really fond of the baggy fit from sizing up. But with this shirt, the slim-fit in a size larger is a really nice fit on him. It's tailored looking without being too snug. He is a bit between sizes L and XL, and this shirt in XL is perfect. Our only complaint is that the fabric is actually a little shiny. It's not noticeable in the ad, but in person it has a definite sheen to it. But it's lightweight and washed up well. The green color is really nice, too.",

Greg Daniels,WHITE shirt arrived with blue ink stain under the tag on the collar...

I have not even unbuttoned it so I can try it on to see how it fits, as once I noticed the blue mark, that was it for me!  I will never wear this!  I was going to start a return to exchange it, even though I got it for free (to review), it just seems more trouble than it's worth.  And who is to say the replacement would not also have a blue mark on the white shirt?  If they did replace it, I would ask for a dark color shirt next time.  But this one is going in the trash!  If they send me another color to replace this shirt, then I will update this review accordingly!  UPDATE (Feb 1st)... I received the replacement shirt today, and it has the exact same issue... blue ink line /spot/ stain right through the fabric, on the collar under the tag.  in fact, this shirt has an even bigger blue stain than the last one.  If I could change this to NO STARS, I would.  This shirt is horrible.  Never even got to try one on.  Both had to be sent back.  I would AVOID ORDERING THIS HORRIBLE SHIRT!!!",2
