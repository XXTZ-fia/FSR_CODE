First off, it looks NOTHING like the picture. The fabric is cheap, stiff, and uncomfortable—definitely not the soft, breathable material I was expecting. The fit is strange, and the cut is just… weird. It looks like something you'd wear to a funeral or, at best, a maternity dress. The silhouette is unflattering, and I honestly feel like I’m being swallowed by the fabric.  For $40, I expected something much better. This jumpsuit is an absolute mess and nothing like what was advertised. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Save your money and look elsewhere. ZERO STAR RATING",
