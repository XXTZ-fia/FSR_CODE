I've searched very hard for the righ blouses and took a chance on this brand. I was very surprised at how soft this blouse is. Polyester is the one for me but in this case this blouse is much more softer than others I have purchased. I will certainly buy more but the down side is...I will not purchase any more long sleeve blouses because they are very hard to iron without adding an additional crease. I recommend this blouse very much. Also I love the many colors to choose from.,

It hangs nicely and isn’t ultra thin see-through material. I also like the pleat in the back and how it compliments the blouse shape.,
