Its versatile design makes it perfect for both casual and formal occasions. The good quality fabric is soft, comfortable, and drapes beautifully. The 3/4 sleeves offer a flattering and stylish length that can be dressed up or down. Whether I'm pairing it with jeans for a casual look or a skirt for a more formal, this top is sure to elevate my outfit.",2

For the comfort of the material, the price is amazing. The style is modern enough, but you could definitely make this feel very 90s goth with the right skirt or pants, given the velvet flower accents. I think you could even style this with the right skirt for a Victorian period costume, if you wanted. The shirt fits true to size, and is very accurately represented in the product photos.",3

The products are true to US sizing and are well made. This top with an embroidered overlay is great. The V-neck is flattering without being revealing and the sleeves are a good length. I really appreciate that the lining material underneath is the exact same color as the overlay and all the seams are neat and well sewn. The material of both the top and lining provide stretch. This top is versatile as it would look great to dress up jeans or with a nice skirt or slacks for a dressier look.,
No,Good fit.

The medium fit as expected. The fabric seems of good quality with solid stitching.  I tried to order the white but received the “wine.” I’m going to give the seller the benefit of the doubt and assume I made a mistake in ordering. With that said, the “Wine” is a nice color with a bit of a sparkly sheen. However, it seems like it has a bit of a fall / holiday / Christmas -type vibe to it.  Other than that limitation, I like it.",

Up close, the fabric is a kind of netting on top with a mesh lining.  In my opinion, the top is not for casual wear as it is too dressy looking, but for holidays or evenings out, it's a go.",

It is made of high-quality material with very elegant lace over the top. I ordered a large but considered an extra large. The large fits just fine. As with all other shirts that I wear, I wish it could be a little bit longer. That does not take away from my review, the sleeves are adorable with a little flair on the end, the main part is body hugging, but the lace covers up what you need covered up such as a muffin top. I would recommend this shirt. It is very beautiful and classy looking.",

(That's what I said to myself when I pulled it from the package: ""oooh, this is fancy!"")  A top like this, I completely expected to be unyielding, but it's comfortably stretchy, so when you put it on or take it off, you're not worried you're suddenly going to rip a seam.  The attached undershirt is of a decent weight so it's not see-thru, and the fit was really good - just loose enough without looking baggy. Honestly, fabulous top!",

It's a long tunic top with an internal lining and transparent sleeves. Has a dressy sparkle design on the fabric that is eye catching. Very flattering for most figures as it's curved around the sides, and the v-neckline is not too low. The neckline itself has a suede type fabric. It flows nicely and since it's longer, can be either tucked in or worn loose over a skirt or dress pants. Very comfortable and lightweight so perfect for summer evenings out. No wrinkles at all straight out of the package.",5
