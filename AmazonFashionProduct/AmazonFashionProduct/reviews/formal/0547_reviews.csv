He wore it with a button-down shirt underneath, and it worked great for a business-casual look.  The material is lightweight yet warm, which is ideal for fall weather when you need something cozy but not too heavy. The fabric feels soft and is comfortable for all-day wear, plus the quarter zip gives it a nice touch of versatility so he can adjust for warmth or style.  The only reason for four stars instead of five is that it could be a tad longer in the torso for those who are taller, but overall, it's a great buy for the price.

And did I mention soft?! It is so soft!  If you check out my video you can get a close-up view of what the sweater looks like after laundering (both washing and drying).  I tend to hang dry my sweaters, but I wanted to test this and see how well it did in the dryer (on medium), and it performed beautifully. That makes this not just a great everyday sweater, but a perfect option for travel as well. I would call this a regular fit, although it isn’t at all baggy. And I chose to order a size down from my normal size, because this brand tends to run a little big for my taste. The size chart is accurate, so if you want something that is a little more on the athletic side, then consider ordering down if you’re on the border of two sizes like I am. As you’ll see, the color is kind of a “linen” color. It isn’t a yellowo-ish tone or white. But it also isn’t dull beige. It is actually a great color. It is medium weight - perfect to wear on its own over a t-shirt, or layer over a polo or long-sleeve shirt. It looks way more expensive than it is (it is a stellar value, in my opinion).

They slightly blend in so I could get away with it, but they're still there nonetheless and it is quite annoying. The fit is okay after folding it under, it does fit true to size for the most part. The material is super soft and falls nicely on the body. Although you can zip it up I wouldn't recommend it, I don't fancy the look, it looks awkward in my opinion. I was able to fit a white t-shirt underneath it to give it a more casual look and I really liked it, however, a button up would probably look nice underneath it as well. It has a nice little weight to it, the zipper could be smoother but I won't be using it, so whatevs. All in all, it's a fairly decent look and fit.",4

wynn,"Nice, soft sweater! I sized up so I could put a shirt under it",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGQYDAH4DUL1X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXMNXQM,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 15, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Brown,,"I recently got this quarter-zip brown sweater (with a small pattern) and I’m pleased with it. Made from 100% polyester, the sweater is very soft and has a medium weight, which will be great for early fall. While the zipper isn’t as robust as those on some of my other sweaters, it is decent enough for regular use.  I decided to size up from my usual medium to a large because I wanted to wear a long-sleeved tee or a casual button-down shirt underneath without feeling restricted. This turned out to be a good decision. For reference, I am 6’ tall and weigh 150 lbs. The large size provided ample sleeve length and a generously long body, which taller individuals (like me!) will appreciate. However, if you’re not tall, the body length could be a bit too much.  I plan to wash this in cold water and lay it flat to dry.  Overall, the sweater is very comfortable and looks good with jeans and khakis. If you’re looking for a soft, medium-weight sweater that you can layer, this one is a great option, especially at the price, which is $27.99 at the time of this writing. If it pills up or falls apart, I will update this review.",2

I'm more of a slim to athletic build so hoped this Medium would fit me. And it fits perfectly, I can even wear a thin undershirt and it still fits well. Material is nice. Looks great!",
