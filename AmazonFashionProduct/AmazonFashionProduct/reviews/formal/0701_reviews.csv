jenny br,Flattering cut retro style,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4SBWUWN52NVV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D448ZSHS,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 29, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Navy Blue,Verified Purchase,"This dress is well made and the fabric is a a substantial weight with just enough stretch. It has a subtle sheen which mimics the look of a heavy silk. I love the fact that the fabric isn’t thin. The cut is very form fitting- more than I like so I ordered one size up and it fits very well. It is snug with stretch but not so tight as to show every lump. I usually wear a 8-10 petite dresses so I ordered a L and it fits right. It is very snug across the tummy and will accentuate this area. The top portion may be too large if you have narrow shoulders and small tatas. The sleeves are slim fit which is nice. I love the retro look , the length ,and the slimming proportions. Fabric may be too heavy for summer, although I ordered one in light blue for next spring since I get chilled in A/C. I’m very happy with the deep navy for fall and winter.",4
E L,Classy Dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GXL7QPCMIUR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D448ZSHS,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 11, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Red,Verified Purchase,"This dress is classy. The dress is true to color.  I  bought both my size and one size up. The one that is my actual size was not tight because the fabric has stretch to it, but it did hug my body and I didn’t like that. The one that was one size bigger, gave me the room my body needed so it didn’t feel like it was hugging my body. It felt perfect. The 3/4 sleeves gave me the coverage I wanted. The length was perfect right below my knee, so I didn’t have to hem it. I liked it so much I’m buying it in various colors for every season.  I know it says you can wash it, but I won’t. Instead, I’ll dry clean it.  I love that it has a V neck both on front and back. I am 5’3” and weigh 163. I normally wear a Size12/14 or a L/XL. I bought both the XL and it hugged my lower half. I ordered the XXL and it fit perfect. I wish the dress was lined and not of stretch fabric, but it’s not. The colors are vibrant and it fits well and is very versatile. I feel this dress can be worn for ANY occasion. I highly recommend this dress if you want to look and feel classy.",8

The fabric is a nice quality and it stretches so I don’t feel stuffed in it (even though I had gained a few pounds.) The green is rich and I get lots of compliments when I wear it.  What I don’t like though is that all along the bust line the fabric doesn’t seem to be stitched. So the fabric rolls out so there isn’t a nice edge. I have to use lots of magic tape it so it won’t buckle out. If I was handy perhaps I could glue of stitch this fabric together. (It’s like they folded the fabric under and then pressed it.)  Other than that, it’s a fabulous dress!",8

The fabric is semi-elastic and highlights exactly what you want to highlight. The collar is lined and wide. It is not glued in the center. You can easily shape your cufflinks and adapt it to your taste. I don't like to show much but it makes you feel divine. The bottom is slightly transparent but not too much. The dress weighs nothing, is comfortable and light. The fabric is resistant. Quality finishes, nothing tight; I recommend that you buy a larger size. I am 1.56 centimeters tall and weigh 84 kilos. I normally wear size L but I ordered an XL and it was the best. I recommend that you order a size larger than what you wear. I will order more in different colors.",16

The slit in the skirt part was not in a good place should it ride up. I believe it would fit better in the chest/neckline w/ someone who has a smaller top than mine. The seam at crossover rolled over. For my height, it was above knee standing w/o heels. Loved the fabric, perfect balanced weight.

Purchased it for a local magazine shoot where we all had to “Go Red”.  Lots of ladies were rocking “Rent the Runway” but due to poor planning on my part I had to “Brave the Amazon”.  The dress had stretchy fabric that was thick enough to be forgiving and show no bumps or rolls when paired with some Spanx.  Hugged my curves and made me look very va-va-voom.  HOWEVER, invest in some double sided fabric tape if you are bothered by the two to three inches of “fabric flap” you get on the inside of the necklines on cheaper dresses.  On a crew neck the seams stay put and the flaps don’t ride up, but with this wrap neckline they don’t stay put and you get a lot of “fabric flap” creeping out.  (See pics) It gives the dress away as being on the lower end quality wise.  Fabric tape did the trick for the couple hours that I needed it to.  If the dress wasn’t for a photo shoot and maybe just a night out I probably wouldn’t be so nit-picky on it.  Three stars because of the neckline issue. If the flaps weren’t a problem I would give it five.",302

I am short 4'10 130lb and larger bust. I was torn between a medium and a small.  I decided to do a small my normal size I buy because everyone was saying it had nice stretch. I am so happy I went with my gut and got a small it fit like a glove. When taking it out of the package I was scared it looked small but it had a nice long zipper and the stretch made it hug my body in all the right places. The shoulders fit not too big at all and yes the front slides up but I still gave it 5 starts because I knew that was a problem already so I had already bought the fabric tape.

I ended up fitting much better in the small and didn’t have the problem of my shoulders falling down so often and the bust fit me much better, I think it’s meant to just be tight fitting. I have bigger arms and both gave me ample room in the arm and the pleating around the stomach is very flattering for those of us with a little belly. The material has a lot of give and it’s a very nice weight, the design is cute. If you’re having issues with the lining poking out and the bust dropping too low you can fix it with some iron on hemming tape and a small stay stitch at the desired place for the bust or if you don’t like sewing you could use some garment tape. Super cute I’ll be getting more from them soon! 🙂",87

At first I thought it was too snug because I needed a bit of assistance with the zipper but after getting zipped and arranging and fixing the dress properly it wasn’t too snug at all. It fit just right. My girls aren’t spilling out and it all just has such a classy vintage feel to it. The material has stretch to it so it kind of just hugs you in the right places and hides some of that mommy pooch.  I purchased the black one for an April wedding in a few weeks. Love this dress!!!,26
Alicia Thornton,"Cute, but fit a little weird.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NOZNIG71LY6R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D448ZSHS,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 17, 2021",Size: SmallColor: Merlot,Verified Purchase,"I wore this to a wedding, and the fit was great, except in the shoulders. As you can see in the photo, I had trouble all night with the shoulders of the dress falling down. I don't have a large bust, and I have pretty narrow shoulders, so this may not be a problem for most people. Overall, the dress was a good quality material, but easily wrinkled. I ironed it a little before the wedding and parts of it were still wrinkled. Good stretch and easy to move in.",4

This is the first dress from this brand that was too small. I own 6 to 7 other dress in the same size and they fit very nicely. I am very sad. Will have to return,

jacque halpert,Nice dress BUT,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGNHGTK4TZFNG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D448ZSHS,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 28, 2020",Size: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,The material is nice and overall it’s a nice dress. It also fits pretty well in terms of overall size. There are a few things though: it is too large in the shoulders which makes it uncomfortable because it makes the bust too large and fabric doesn’t sit at your arms properly and the flap of fabric at the front keeps folding up due to this.  I’m still deciding if I want to keep this dress or return it. I might end up hemming the shoulders myself to fix this problem.,3
