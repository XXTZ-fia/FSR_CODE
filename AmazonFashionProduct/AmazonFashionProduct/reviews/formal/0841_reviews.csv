The fit is a bit slim, so if you have a larger build, it may not fit well. Overall, it's a decent option for casual occasions, but don't expect exceptional quality.",

I bought it a few weeks before the wedding, since I wasn't sure of the quality you get with a $99 suite....just in case I needed to buy something else. But, no need. The suite is lightweight, linen material, perfect for the outdoor wedding we attended. It fits well, looks sharp and I got a few compliments even from my wife who doubted my purchase. I told my good friends it only cost $99, and they thought I was kidding. Only downside, it doesn't have belt loops, only a string, which is OK since when buttoned no one can see it. I thought this might be a ""one and done"" suite, but I'll keep it for any other events, especially if it's hot or outside.",2

(a miracle) So make sure you follow the measurements closely. I needed a suit for a wedding, and this was stylish without making me look too boxy. I wish there was a lapel pocket so I could have added a touch of flair there. Missed opportunity. I did have to spend a great deal of time steaming out the wrinkles when I opened the suit, but it handled that well and looked great afterwards. Another complaint is that I wanted more of a 'gray' color, and this definitely looked more tan than gray. So the color wasn't 100% what I thought I was getting.

The pants from both sets are more consistent in the way they feel on the body, and they fit well; after years of wearing belts with pants, I don't miss their restrictions and got quite used to the stretch and rope tie combo.

If you're not familiar, linen is a lightweight material, ideal for semi-casual wear and is especially at home in warmer climes. It can crumple quite easily but apparently, according to my better dressed friends, that is part of the look.  I liked the chalky blue color though the suit comes in a variety of shades if that's not your thing.  Overall this worked for me. The fit was good. It's on the slim side, particularly if you associate linen with a ""baggy"" look but I found it very comfortable for my size and shape.

It offers exceptional breathability and comfort. There is no stretch to the fabric itself, but the added elastic at the back of the pants means that there is plenty of flexibility at the waistline.  The fit is a little odd. I ordered this in the size medium and while the jacket fits very well, the pants are somewhat huge at the waist.

Neutral Points: While the suit offers great value, there are a few neutral aspects to consider. Firstly, the color options, while classic, could be expanded to cater to a broader range of preferences. Providing a more extensive color palette would allow customers to choose suits that align with their personal style.  Additionally, while the suit is easy to wash, it's advisable to follow the care instructions diligently to maintain its quality over time. Like any well-made garment, proper care is essential for longevity, and customers should be aware of the recommended washing methods and guidelines provided by the manufacturer.
