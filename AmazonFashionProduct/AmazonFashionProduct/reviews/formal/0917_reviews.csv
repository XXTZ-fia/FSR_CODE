I was pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price! Definitely feels and looks like a $300 suit. I love the color. It is exactly like the picture. It slightly brighter than a Kelly green. It runs true to size and the fit feels tailored like an expensive suit. There’s just enough stretch in the material to be able to bend and snap. I was able to wear this suit for 8+ hours because it was so comfortable. It’s a medium weight material with lining in the jacket. I wore a fitted body suit underneath but you could also wear a looser blouse. I paired it with ankle boots but a medium heel would be great for this length pant.,12

The material is soft and has just the right amount of stretch, allowing me to move comfortably throughout the day. The blazer drapes beautifully and adds an elegant touch to any outfit. The fit is true to size, and the tailoring gives a flattering silhouette without being too tight.  I also appreciate the quality of the stitching and the overall construction. The set looks and feels much more expensive than it is, which is a huge plus. I’ve received so many compliments whenever I wear it!  This 2 piece suit set is a must-have for anyone looking to add a touch of sophistication to their fall wardrobe. Highly recommend it for anyone who wants to look polished and put-together with minimal effort!",10
