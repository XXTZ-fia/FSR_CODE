I bought 3 sizes, because then I could return whichever one didn't fit.  My son is 5'8, 118 lbs, and very skinny.  The 20 fit him fine.  Just a little extra room in pants which was perfect and jacket was good.  I don't really like the support in the coat shoulders, but it looks fine.  The length is perfect for jacket- not much room for growth, but it's an inexpensive suit he'll probably only wear once or twice this year.  The pants definitely are slim fit on bottom part.  Luckily, he is very skinny.  Ironically, the 18 pants were huge and the jacket fit the same.  So weird the 18 pants are so big, but the 20 pants fit well.  This suit is definitely hit or miss depending on your child's size and the suit size.  I would ordered a few different sizes since it's free returns.",

Talking about is the length for my 6’ son. Also only size 18 came with tags, none of the other suits had a tag and to return they are asking if I kept the tag on? What tag. Also the pants and coats have loose threads. Worst quality than the year before. I’m done with this brand.  I have a 17 y/o 5’5 123lbs this suit is navy. The coat fit a bit too boxy for my slim child. Pants are very long they would need to be adjusted. Quality seems ok! Better than the other one we got.
