It was an amazing price, fabric, and fit. I wore it diligently for years before a zipper malfunction ended a successful run. The price had gone up so I hesitated about getting another one but finally cracked. I am so disappointed I wasted my time. The fabric is completely different, some weird shiny material that is thinner. The cut isn’t the same, the same size is way off, the area where the belt goes has some weird strip. I couldn’t even wear it. Immediately returning and on the hunt once again for the perfect jumpsuit or a tailor who can restructure a zipper for a worthwhile price.",3
