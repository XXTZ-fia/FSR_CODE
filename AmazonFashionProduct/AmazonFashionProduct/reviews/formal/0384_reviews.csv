Well, what I got was a very tight fitting shirt that I could barely button, and it fit like a glove. My size is 15.5, 34-35, and most medium shirts and even slim-fit shirts fit me very comfortably. The collar size, sleeve length, and cuffs were ok, and the material felt thick. Being a 60/40 cotton blend, this shirt will probably shrink further, so I can't image what it will look like after a wash. I also received the shirt in the clear store display sleeve with the shipping label stuck over it. I get that we should use less packaging, but I thought that was really odd, and wondered what the vendor would do if you shipped a return in that manner and the shirt was damaged during shipping. Maybe the larger sizes fit better, as this product had high reviews, which is why I got it. Look elsewhere if you wear a medium size.",
