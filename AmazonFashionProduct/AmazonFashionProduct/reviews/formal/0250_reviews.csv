It will, however, be perfect for the 2 weddings I will be attending next month. My only complaint is that where the materials stretches around my bra line on my back, the fabric noticeably lightens. I want to emphasize that it isn’t see through at all, but the lightening effect gives the impression that it could be. I could probably fix this by going up a size, but it’s not that bad and I don’t want any extra length. It’s still beautiful and comfortable. Emphasizes the bump too.

A lot of chest room Fits in all the right places Has pockets Simple and can be worn on many occasions. Has long sleeves to hide my chunky arms.

I have tried other dresses and I was afraid I was going to have a wardrobe malfunction: this dress was not that way. The chest area has room to grow but still looks flattering!  Cons: I wish the sleeves were a little longer. I have long arms. Kind of a stiff cotton tee shirt material?
