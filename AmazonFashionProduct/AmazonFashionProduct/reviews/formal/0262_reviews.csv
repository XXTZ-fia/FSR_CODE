Again at Thanksgiving but chose something else. Finally purchased for a party - and I am so disappointed. The material is cheap. The snap closure in the front doesn't sit flat. The color/design is the worst part! The navy is very dark. The florals - there are no white flowers - they are pink and muted. All the colors are muted. The yellow is sad.

The main part of the dress is two layers while the sleeves are more see-through colored mesh. It was exactly as advertised in my opinion. I would buy again or from the same brand. The only thing is the neckline closes with a small snap which has popped open a few times with regular movement. So i may sew or pin that closed. It’s generally fine though as long as i don’t reach too far back. Other than this flaw, it is a nice dress and comfortable. I have gotten several compliments in the times wearing it so far.",

The length felt shorter than it looked because of the liner but I stayed covered. Will definitely ride up when you life you arms over your head (see unflattering second photo of me trying to catch my hat lol).  My only complaint is that the boob snap does not stay closed. Other reviews said the same too. Even trying to sit up straight with my shoulders back popped that bad boy. I gave up trying to keep it closed because it was a wedding but for a professional or more reserved setting use caution. It won't be as modest as you think.  Overall I love the dress and will be ordering more but in a size up so I can use them for work and have a bit of extra length and chest security.",2
