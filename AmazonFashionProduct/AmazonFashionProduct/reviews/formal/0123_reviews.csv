Ljd1978,Gorgeous and flowy - my 8 year olds new favorite dress.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRF7SXTYQSQZ5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLNXH8SV,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 13, 2023",Size: 10-11 YearsColor: A Light Blue,,"I'm going to get right to the point - my 8yo daughter loves this dress SO much that I've washed it 3 days in a row so she coudl wear it continuously.  The material is light and flowy, so be careful because the back is prone to snagging because it's so thin.Overall, the dress is beautiful.  The design is almost princess like with the long layer in the back being so light and airy, almost like a train (my daughter compared it to the Frozen II dress). I'd say it runs true to size for the most part. I ordered a size 10-11 for my 8yo who is wearing size 10 clothing and it fit nicely with some room to grow. I washed it in a delicated bag due to the light sheerness of part of the dress and hung it to dry. We're about 2 weeks into wearing this dress multiple times in a row and it's holding up decently well considering the feel of the fabric. You definitely don't need to save it for formal occasions as I can guarantee that most girls would love to wear it as an everyday dress.",2
