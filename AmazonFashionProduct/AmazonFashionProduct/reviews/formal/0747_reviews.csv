They are nice enough. I was looking for something black with a splash of color, and that is what I got. What I got that I didnt want, is all the loose threads. Buttons, seams, cuff, collar, all have threads coming out of them. These shirts will probably start to come apart eventually. Besides that , they are nice enough, and comfortable enough. They do have double buttons so it takes longer to put on but it kind of looks nice. The color is only on the cuff not the entire inside, SO, you cant ROLL your sleeves up. You can only push them up. This means they are constantly sliding back down.",3

It’s very soft and thin breathable material. Looks really nice. Only issue I have really is that the shirt is designed to be a flip cuff style, but the sleeves are a little big, so if you do the flip cuff and then try to pull them up a little to be more like 3/4 length, they just fall back down. It may just be the XL is a little big for me, but not sure. I will try the L and see if it fits a little better. But overall for the price, it’s a pretty nice shirt",3
