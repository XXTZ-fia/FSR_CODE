The other is a long sleeve shirt.  Let me lead with this comment. This FITS a guy with Long arms!! I am 6'4"", 208# with long legs and arms. According to how they measure, I have a 44"" chest, about 20"" shoulders and 29"" arms. For a dress shirt I would measure from my spine and then my ""sleeve"" would be 38"".  This Sweater says the XXL is a 48.3"" Bust (chest?) 19.4"" Shoulders and 26.4"" arm. Both in reality and as you can see from the pictures, it fits me well. I think it is very possible that I could have gotten just an XL and it would then have been a Trim fit but STILL fit in the arms. I am not sure though.  I got this sweater just before I went to Ireland for a vacation, so I chose a couple real life photos instead of posed ones. As you can see, the sleeves are the perfect length and the fit is good and not real baggy even though this is the XXL. As far as feel, weight, quality, and fabric, it is all really good. I have washed the sweater a couple times and it has held up fine. It felt nice without an undershirt, and fit fine with one as well. Now that I have even more experience with this brand, I am even more confident that I DO recommend this sweater, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another. I might even buy the XL and see how it fits...",2
