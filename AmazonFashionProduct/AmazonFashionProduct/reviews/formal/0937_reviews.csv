I have a good 4 extra inches of material around my waist and the fabric goes down to mid-calf. I wish the company (or companies) who sell these styles would make them in a size XS, as even the small requires a minimum height of 5'7"" and a larger build in order to make them form-fitting. The material is really nice and comfortable, the collars are a bit stiff though and sit kind of awkwardly if you unbutton a few top buttons. If these fit I would order them in several colors, but alas, I will have to do without until they start making a smaller size.",

It’s a great dress for dressing up or down, and I received several compliments when I first wore it.  Unfortunately, after just two washes, the dress started to show significant pilling, which was really disappointing. The fabric doesn’t look nearly as fresh or polished anymore, and I feel like it’s lost that “new” look much faster than expected. It’s still wearable, but it’s not the kind of piece I’ll reach for when I want to look polished or put-together. I’ll probably get a couple more uses out of it, but it definitely didn’t hold up as well as I’d hoped.  Overall, while it’s a stylish piece and looks great initially, the fabric quality could be better. I’d recommend it if you’re okay with it being more of a short-term wardrobe addition.",

Amazon Customer,Nice for the fall weather,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L35JW4DMR4TA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB1RXNMB,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 22, 2024",Color: WhiteSize: Medium,,"The MEROKEETY Women's Long sleeve sweater dress arrived rather creased from being vacuum sealed. I washed it (cool water) and dried on a low setting until mostly dry, then hung up to completely dry and that seemed to take care of the creases. The material is nice and soft and the dress has maintained its shape and softness after several washes. It seems like it would be reasonably versatile - it has a relatively flirty, swingy silhouette while also being perfectly suitable to wear to the office. You can pair it with boots for a more casual fall look but can also dress it up with heels for a more polished look and a bit of va-voom. Because of the slim fit/flared skirt I believe it will be more flattering on someone with a bit of an hour-glass figure. I got this in white and, while it's not so thin that you can see through it, it doesn't support wearing shape wear beneath it, so if you have a little pooch, this may not be the most flattering dress for you.",

However, I was disappointed that a button had popped off during the day and I didn’t even know it until I looked in the mirror! There definitely needs to be more stitching to keep the buttons in place for a long time.  Otherwise, I don’t have any major complaints. The fit is pretty good… I followed the size chart and didn’t have any issues with fit. Also, it’s listed as a mini dress, but the length actually fell to right above my knee- which is great for me because it made the dress more appropriate to wear to work (I’m 5’6”).  The material is really soft and comfy! I love the ribbed knit… it was very cozy to wear in fall temperatures. And the pleating just gives the overall look a little dimension. I also liked the fact that the dress was form fitting at the top and the skirt flared at the bottom; it created a very flattering silhouette.  And I do like the button-up design at the top, especially how the white buttons and lines play off of the brown dress and really pop. I just wish the buttons wouldn’t pop off the dress is all!  Overall, I think this is a fine purchase. If you have some sewing skills and can reinforce the sewing on these buttons, I’d highly recommend you do so before you wear it. Fortunately, it was just the top button that popped off for me… a button in the middle or at the bottom could have really caused a problem.",31
