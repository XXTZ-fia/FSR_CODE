The quality is very good, the material has a good weight to it and the stitching and buttons are good quality.  My only critique - I got the small size and it’s a very “generous” small - more like a large medium.  I will need to take the blazers to a skilled seamstress to shorten the sleeves and hopefully do a nip & tuck in some areas to make it more flattering.",2
