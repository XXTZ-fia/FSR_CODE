You can wear them with skirts or dress pants as shown, or also over dresses or with jeans. The only closed (buttoned) picture does not do it justice at all. It looks so much better on!  Mine (brown) just arrived and I tried it on with the last button closed with jeans and loved it so much that I immediately ordered both the white and the blue!  If you wear them closed they hug your figure and show off your waist line.  If you wear them open, you can could camouflage the lack of a waistline.  Awesome material, awesome cut, and awesome price!  I am a huge fan - THANK YOU to the manufacturers!There is only one problem.  They come badly wrinkled with no instructions for getting the wrinkles out.  So far spraying them with water and drying does not work.  Will revise this review (and change to five stars) if I find a way to get the wrinkles out, but if not I will leave the review up and send them back.",

Very nice texture and thick.  I live in Florida, so, the thicker fabric is perfect for Fall/Winter here as it adds a nice warmth.  I have several black blazers as I wear blazers all the time.

To make sure I wasn’t losing it, I put it back on the couch where I first opened it, took another pic, and yep—still gray.

The jackets I found before this one were polyester and looked so cheap, and the buttons were shiny plastic. THIS jacket is not either of those things.  The fabric of this jacket is a heavy tweed texture and looks lux. This double breasted jacket is fully lined, has two front pockets with flaps, as well as two mock-pockets with flaps. The buttons are metal with a yellow gold finish. I steamed out the wrinkles with no problems.  I am 5'7"", a 38C, have broad 17.5"" wide shoulders, long arms, and wear a US size 14/L or 16/XL depending on the manufacturer. I have an hourglass figure with my waist being smaller than my hips. I ordered an XL and it fit me loosely across my shoulders, and the sleeves hit me a little past my wrists, which was great since I often feel like sleeves on jackets are too short. I can button the jacket just fine and can likely wear it over a light sweater with no problem. However, I do think it looks best when worn unbuttoned. It looked great and very polished when I wore it with a white and black striped boatneck fitted t-shirt, dark blue jeans, and black adidas sneakers. I also felt great wearing it!  While the gold buttons are metal and a nice heavy quality, they are too yellow for my liking as I don't wear gold very often. I also found the three sleeve buttons a little bothersome when sitting at my desk working. They clanked a bit on the desk and I felt like I was scratching the surface as well as the buttons. Not a deal breaker by any means but I did purchased antiqued silver buttons to replace all the buttons and only plan to put one button on each sleeve.  Overall, this is a SOLID good value purchase that I can recommend. I'm even thinking of purchasing it in gray.",20

The measurements description for the waist is completely wrong… there was at least 3 inches from being able to button the blazer at all so I had to walk around with the blazer open… now that I’ve lost weight, my measurements are 43” bust, 29” waist and 46” hips and the blazer buttons perfectly. There is zero stretch so please remember to size up. The waist for the Large is definitely fits only if your waist is smaller than 30”.
