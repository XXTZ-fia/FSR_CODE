I have a larger frame and find that this V neck style is flattering.  The elastic waist is generous, providing a nice silhouette without feeling too stuffy.  The ruffle makes this dress look more stylish, making it appropriate for either a nice dinner or occasion.  This dress washes nicely, you are able to put it in the dryer without fading or stretching out.  I recommend hanging it up immediately from the dryer and it looks incredible.",

It's a little thin and a bit sheer, so if you're going to be in an area with bright lights, consider a slip or bodysuit underneath for modesty.  Seaming is well-done, and the garment seems well designed.My only gripe is that there is nothing in the bust area to accommodate people who can't fill it out properly.  Instead, the fabric just flops if you don't have the bustline to fill it out, and it doesn't look good.  You can sort of accommodate this with a wide elastic belt by tucking the excess bust fabric under the belt, but it does make the dress extremely low-cut to do that.",

It fits incredibly well too. It is a tiny bit large in the bust area, but as a cross over top it doesn't gape open too much, even if it's big. It's not silk, but feels as soft and silky as the real thing. The color is a nice deep evergreen. It's super comfortable on too.

ReviewingQueen,For larger chests; thin material with no stretch,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RC104PS5M0MB6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D66MJ6PT,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 12, 2024",Color: Emerald GreenSize: 4X-Large Plus,,"Overall, I would say that this is an average dress, which is why I am giving it an average 3-star rating.  The first thing I noticed was that the color is more of a green than an emerald green.  I was hoping the color would be a bit darker for a fall/winter wedding.  The second thing I noticed is that the material is thin, so you can definitely see through it in the light.  As a result, you will likely need to wear a slip or something underneath this.  Although the material is thin, it doesn't have any stretch to it.  There is stretch to the elastic waist, but not to the material itself.  So it's not super comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  In terms of fit, I sized up (I typically wear a 3X and ordered the 4X).  I'm glad I did that because of the non-stretch material, however the chest area is quite large.  I'm going to have to stitch it so it does not hang loose (I'm a C cup).  Finally, the style does pretty much look as pictured, however I would say the bottom has more of a high/low effect.  The photos make it look like the slit goes quite high, but thankfully it is only right above the knee so it is still tasteful for a wedding guest dress.  The length of the dress is a bit awkward, but I'm also tall (5'11"").  It hits me right above the ankles, so it's not really full length or cocktail length.  For all these reasons, I would say this is an average dress.",

Create With Joy,Great Dress But Long On Petite Frames,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZB6Y1BCLTQ2U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D66MJ6PT,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 11, 2024",Color: Lake BlueSize: XX-Large Plus,,"This pretty and feminine dress is great for women who like flowing dresses. The cut is generous – although this fits I should have ordered a size down from my normal size. My main problem with the dress is that at 5”4, this is a floor length dress on me (it does not appear that long in the photos). It is still very lovely and very wearable, but not as versatile as I had hoped for.",
M,Such a pretty dress but runs big,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X2SNV3J0MPTE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D66MJ6PT,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 7, 2024",Color: Lake BlueSize: X-Large Plus,,"Ok, the first thing to note is that this dress is specifically for plus sized individuals and that is def my case, but, it assumes that the people wearing these dresses also have very large chests, and that may be true of many people, but apparently, it is not true for me. As a D cup, I thought I may be ok there, but the chest area is large enough that I’ll need to either wear something under the dress, or will need to clip it so I keep things inside.  The rest of the dress fits great. It is pretty flexible in terms of elasticity, so even if I gained some weight the waist would fit great. I am 5’3” and this fits almost to my ankles, so, unless you’re pretty tall, the length of this dress will not be as the model in the ad.  The sleeves are super pretty and the slit on the side isn’t so high that I fear exposure. Overall, this dress is a great addition to my summer/ fall wardrobe and I can’t recommend it enough.",8
