The ""Apricot - Black Floral"" looks white in the photo, but the actual shirt is more cream/off-white.  It also appears to be more of a wide V-neck, and the actual shirt has a much narrower V.  In hindsight, I also wish I had ordered a solid color because I know that after a few washings of this shirt, the black will fade and it will not be as attractive as it looks now because it is knit.  I was expecting more of a chiffon-like, flowing material because that's what the shirt looks like in the listing.All that aside, the fit is wonderful.  The knit is soft and comfortable.  I hope I can get lots of wear from it because it is perfect for work.",

It's a great weight for warmth in the cooler months or layering in the cold months.  It's not tight through the shoulders, back, or armpits. Plenty of flexibility. Very comfortable and soft. And the length is perfect in both the front and back.  Only drawback is that it wrinkles easily. However, the wrinkles aren't severe.  I'd buy this again in a variety of colors and patterns.

My wife likes the size, which she says is full, meaning that there’s no need to add or subtract, the fabric which is very light and has a great tactile feeling (60% Polyester, 35% Cotton, 5% Spandex), and the finish. No run away stitching, well finished, and the V-like collar is exactly centered. My wife likes it. I am happy.",2
