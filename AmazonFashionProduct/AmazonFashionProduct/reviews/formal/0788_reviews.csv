Amy Elizabeth,Incredible value; looks and feels expensive,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13GGRZJFVRRTB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CZGHNB7R,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Size: 10Color: Cassis,Verified Purchase,Fit like a glove. Fabric weight and quality are nice; not too heavy and doesn’t feel “cheap”. Dress hangs straight but isn’t “clingy” and flows nicely as you walk. Silhouette very flattering. Strapless bra easily hidden by cut of armholes. Only needed to trim tulle for length. Hand beading beautiful. A couple of minor beading pulls but my tailor easily fixed. Highly recommended. I may never buy black tie anywhere else and I have purchased a lot of expensive black tie dresses over the years.,

I believe the quality is excellent for the price.  As far as the so-so side of it, the sequins are literally all over the dress.  Therefore one has to be careful.  Still, moving around through a wedding and reception with it including getting in and out of the car, there were no issues with the sequins, which to me were secure.  Extra sequins had been provided to sew on, should there ever be a need.  I would gladly recommend it.",4

AJ,Beautiful dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33EF7BJOKM8CT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CZGHNB7R,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 2, 2024",Size: 6Color: Blush,Verified Purchase,"As some of the reviews have said, beads fall off. It arrived with about 3 inches of beads missing. However since I was wearing it to a wedding sooner than later and this dress fit amazing on, I decided I could use the package of beads (yes numerous beads) that came shipped with the dress and do a little diy myself. I did not pay full price for the dress, it was 2/3 the original price, so doing a little repair was fine by me. I can sew a little, I am NOT a seamstress by any stretch of the imagination. My diy on the beads turned out great.  The waist measures exactly as defined. Beware if you have larger than average hips or bum. This dress was snug in that area on me. If you are even 1/2 inch larger than the measure for waist, size up. It is slim fit arm holes, slim fit waist, hips and upper thighs. If you are average bust, or small bust you are golden. That said I imagine if you are more well endowed that the top might be a bit snug as well.  I am average build and height, more natural pear than anything.  This dress is made with thousands of beautiful beads. Lots and lots and lots of beads. The beads make it heavier than most other dresses I own. I have had two beaded dresses in recent years, both have been noticeably heavy. Not bad, just aware kind of thing. The good is that the wind did its best to lift the dress and the dress ignored the wind.  This dress has two layers of fabric. One under the fabrics with beads. This is good as it means the skin under is protected by a nice feeling fabrics away from beads.  This also means, I would personally not wear this dress to a 100 degree outside wearing for any length of time, unless I was okay sweating a few pounds. Seriously while it is sleeveless…. It is not a summer dress.  I received numerous compliments. I ordered the pink dress, and the pink is a soft light pink…hard to describe the shade of pink. The beads are a mix of pink, rose, silverish colors, and from afar can change the appearance of the color of dress.  When I looked at pictures online I had a hard time deciding if I should wear silver, pink/rose gold or yellow gold jewelry. Answer: any. In my opinion the dress works well with any color of jewelry. You do not need a necklace, as the neckline is high. It would work with stud earrings or dangle earrings. I have short hair and did not have any issues with my hair getting caught in the beads. I can see how long hair or a hairdo with hanging hair might catch on the beads. I will say I did notice the beads on my bum when I sat in a hard chair, but less noticed when I sat in a soft chair. Wearing the dress for a few hours was comfortable. I personally do not think I would want to wear this for a long car ride to an event, or for several hours if I had to sit the whole time (for example a musical/play or ballet). I wore it to a wearing and only sat during the vows and was sitting only a little, then standing or dancing the rest of the night. The dress was perfect for me for that occasion.",7
