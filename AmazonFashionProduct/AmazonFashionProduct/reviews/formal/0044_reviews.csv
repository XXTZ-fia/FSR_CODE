Amazon Customer Penny,LOVE this dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SB9MF8WNJJJN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQY849FX,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 17, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Needed a dress for my nephew's formal wedding. I ordered many dresses and returned them. I was just about to give up, until this dress arrived. It fit perfectly except that it was a few inches too long- it required a simple hem. The dress was very comfortable as well. It was not too low cut- I didn't have to worry about my bra straps showing or have to keep constantly adjusting anything. The slit in the leg was cut so that I could sit easily without showing too much skin. This dress hit the sweet spot of being appropriate for a church wedding, with glamour, class and a bit of sex appeal. Perfect dress for a formal wedding. Highly recommend!",

Some small adjustments like hem because I’m on the short side. Sleeves could be a little tight if your arms are on the thicker side, but I picked a good size for myself and it fits ok. I think this makes a great ballroom dress or even wedding event dress. The material is actually a little stretchy, enough to get yourself in and if your hips are wide, it shouldn’t be too tight a fit. Looks nice, and I’m keeping it for when I’ve got a ball event.",

J. Fraser,Very nice long dress ideal for an evening party.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YESZ49XPN0AR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQY849FX,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 1, 2024",Size: LargeColor: A-navy Blue,,"So, I ordered this MISSMAY women's elegant sequin V-neck evening dress on a whim because I needed a “cocktail attire” outfit for an evening beach wedding in June, in NC. Who orders a fancy dress online? I liked the various reviews and since I am the aunt, the review which stated that this was a modest gorgeous dress made me say…. why not? I also liked that there are sleeves with this to help camouflage some of my mature woman (not so pleasing) features. Well, I am very pleased. Also, I ordered the size large because one reviewer smaller than me ordered the medium and it fit her. I usually wear a size 10, and my measurement went with the large, and it fits like a glove. I am 5’4”, 35 inch bust and 145 lbs. The navy is perfect as it’s a beach color, and not too formal. I love how form-fitting this is, and yet so different because of the side leg slit and the sequined top. This dress is very comfortable, and the length with heels is perfect. I am very happy with this dress.  Positives: • Exactly like pictures • True to size/measurements • Elegant • Sexy side leg slit • Sleeves • Well made • Length is appropriate to the dress size  Negatives: • Only comes in 3 colors  5 stars",12

This dress was the one I thought I’d like the least, because waist/hip ruffles don’t usually look good on me. Unexpectedly, this one is the winner! It looks sooo much better on than I expected, and flows as I walk! The sequins definitely make it stand out, but aren’t so sparkly that I’ll steal the bride’s thunder.  I’m 5’6” and the slit goes to *just* above my knee. You can wear a bra with this, so no tape is needed. It slims me where I need slimming, and even though parts of it are form fitting, it doesn’t accentuate my trouble areas at all.",3

Price is good for a one time wear event. This is not something I would ear at a very formal wedding mother of the bride, but is great for a prom or a social event when one does not want to spend a ton of money on a formal.  I am 5.2 and 117# got a small and it  is skin tight, as it described and looks like in the pictures. Good for someone younger than me and ok on me, It hides my arms which is what I was after and will be worn at a fund raiser.",
Amazon Customer,Modest gorgeous dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VNP45OGLCXNZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQY849FX,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 23, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,True to the size. I’m 5’2; 125 lbs and got M. The length worked okay with high heels. It was wrinkled when I received it so I ironed it with low heat even if it said no iron… I needed a modest formal dress so it was perfect. I got lots of compliments.,5

It fit nicely everywhere but around where your hips and waist meet. It was a little baggy there around the zipper. The sequins are nice, the slit isnt uneven and the fabric is soft. The color is spot on to the picture. I ordered an XL and probably could have gotten a Large with how loose it is, there is little stretch so keep that in mind though and dont go too small.",2
