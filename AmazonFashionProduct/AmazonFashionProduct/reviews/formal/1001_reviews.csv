Marge S.,"not too low cut, and looks nice on a short torso",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31FQIRL6LFGEL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS6VKDRG,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 5, 2025",Color: Floral PinkSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I am short waisted and usually wear a petite size large. At 5'1' and a 38B, the Large fit well. I thought it was flattering - the sleeves are not too long and the length was perfect in my opinion. The drape is very nice.  It does require a cool iron if you don't take it out of the dryer quick enough. (hence the slight wrinkles in the picture) and I liked that the neck line was not too low.  This is on deck as a my Easter top for this year.  It is cool and has a nice feel next to the body so I expect I will wear it to work a lot as well.",
