I wore it to a holiday party and people called me the sparkle princess. It’s very flattering and the sequins look nice and not cheap. It did get a little bit itchy around the arm holes but nowhere near as bad as other sequined dresses I’ve worn. I washed it inside out in a lingerie bag on the delicate cycle and I didn’t see any sequins in the bag and I hung it to dry and it looks great still. I think one do the best things was that I didn’t have to pin it across my chest. Usually with dresses like this the top gaps too much and I have to pin it but this one was perfect.,

I believe they have upgraded the design to include a tulle material around the arm holes so there is no issue with the sequins rubbing as others have commented. I liked the front of the dress very much, but felt the back of the dress was very straight and flat without any pleats or gathering and I just didn't like that so I will be returning it.",3

The coverage was good- not too revealing in the chest, and the length was short enough to be fun, but still appropriate for a conservative person. The sequins were multi-colored and flat to the dress and looked great. However, the person this was purchased for is extremely sensitive and did not like the way they felt, so I had to return this. Overall, this dress is a great option, and a good value for the cost, but sequins can be a risk for a hypersensitive person.",3

Great fit with a tad of stretch. Lays pretty over the hips. Runs true to size but would recommend sizing up one size if your busty. I put a couple of small stitches on the top to keep it closed. Because it is a surplus style top/neckline… it will show too much if your big busted. I naught it in green sequins color. It sparkles and looks nice for a simi formal event.

I expected to lose a sequin here or there, and did. No biggie. But the dress is now SHEDDING these tiny black bits of what resemble eraser shavings. When the dress moves, it sheds. Wet or dry. Even after I used a lint roller to remove whatever it is that’s sloughing off. It’s exceedingly puzzling, and I’m not sure if I’ll wear it if this persists. But it does fit beautifully, perfect swing in the skirt, and the iridescent look of the sequins is mesmerizing! If you do opt to buy this, I think I’d recommend dry cleaning or hand washing. It seems too fragile for regular washing even on Delicate.",17
