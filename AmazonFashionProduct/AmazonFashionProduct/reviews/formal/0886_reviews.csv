It’s perfect for a long workday, and I still feel polished when I go out afterward.  The shirt has a nice balance of being formal enough for business meetings but casual enough to rock without a tie on a night out. I’ve worn it with a suit jacket for a more professional look and even dressed it down with jeans. Either way, it looks great. The stitching is neat, the buttons are sturdy, and the spread collar gives it a clean, classic appearance.  It’s machine washable too, so maintenance is easy. I’ve already tossed it in the wash a couple of times, and it still looks like new. For under $25, it’s a steal, and I might just grab a few more colors. If you're looking for a sharp, comfortable shirt that works for pretty much any occasion, this one’s definitely worth it!",

It looks exactly the photos, the color matches the pics, the fit is very good, and it can be dressed up or down as needed. I've honestly never owned a more versatile shirt.  It can be worn open-neck, of course. But it accepts a necktie quite well, even though the collar has only a small amount of stiffening, and no collar stays. Sleeves can be worn down or rolled up with equal comfort. The fabric has the tiniest bit of a sheen to it, more similar to a polished cotton (though it's a polyester/spandex blend) than to silk. So it doesn't hit as a ""shiny shirt"" at all, but more like a dress shirt that was just paid a compliment and is grinning a little bit. The spandex does give it some stretch, though I was pleased to note that this isn't (and didn't appear intended to be) a muscle shirt that hugs the torso. I ain't got that kind of torso, so I appreciate the drape and cut of this design that looks a little tapered and flattering without shouting ""gym-bro"" to passersby.  Hard to find anything wrong with this shirt, but if pressured I would say that the sleeves below the elbow are a touch blousy. If it's warm enough, I'll wear the sleeves rolled up. If it's cool enough to wear the sleeves down, I'd probably wear a sweater or jacket over them. I don't care much for even the hint of a blousy ""pirate"" sleeve. This isn't that bad, by any stretch--just be aware that the sleeve will likely be looser around the wrist than on a more structured chambray style business shirt.",4

He must dress conservatively and needs long-wearing, quality shirts in his wardrobe. This option had a good price point, a Spandex blend for some stretch, and easy sizing. The shirt just arrived, so I cannot write of how well it launders (it states it can be thrown in the laundry at home) or the longevity of the shirt, but we are optimistic. At this time, I recommend.",
