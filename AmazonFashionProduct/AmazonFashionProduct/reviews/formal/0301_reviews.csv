Maybe a 3 inches above her ankle. The color wa a nice rich deep purple and the chiffon covering helps to hide anything you don't want seen. My mom is typically between a 16W/18W. I went with thr 18W and it was a great fit. Not to big or to small, but just right. Would definitely recommend and would order again in a different color.
