I immediately imagined all the ways I could style it up or wear it casually. The material quality is great, and tailoring has no immediate issues I noted. I put it in the dry cleaner to be pressed and it looked even better after! I added a wide belt with it, and it looked fabulous. The fit is perfect...nothing not to like about this dress. For reference, I am 5'5"", 173-175 lbs and the sleeves were not tight, and the length was just right.",

The pockets are what first attracted me to getting the dress. It is easy to dress up or down, depending on your accessories. However, because of the mixed and lower-quality fabric, it has become a more casual dress for me to wear with sneakers or boots. I have washed it a few times and retained the dark black color. It is so comfortable and can be worn throughout the whole year.",

The top fabric feels lovely and lays well. It's like a thick, smooth jersey. The skirt is broadcloth. It's okay. I was surprised on the loudness of the fabric when I moved about the room. This is not a dress for a ninja. The pricepoint for me means this dress is a special occasion dress. The look and feel of this dress is more like an everyday dress. You can definitely dress it up and dress it down. The mixed media is very evident in the photos and in person. Overall, it's a meh for me. I'll wear it, but it's not my go-to black dress.",

NB,Nice everyday dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1K6SNXG0EWWN9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDQH4YX4,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 12, 2024",Size: X-SmallColor: Black,,"The upper part of this dress looks like a T-shirt (knitted) while the base is broadcloth. Even though the materials are different, they match nicely in the black version of the dress. The fit of the dress is good and according to size. What would improve this dress, however, is a belt. Without a belt, it doesn't look as nice. Adding a belt really makes a big difference and elevates the style. All in all, this is a simple, everyday dress. I wouldn't wear it on a fancy occasion, but it works for going to the store and for a picnic. It is very easy to put on and take off and is very comfortable to wear.",

The fabric of the skirt holds its shape nicely and the length is great on me. For reference, I'M 6 feet tall, 139 lbs, wearing a size Large. I belted it because the bodice is a little short for me, but I Love it belted.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because as it hung front and center in my walk-in closet, it collected a lot of lint. So I expect it will do the same when I wear it :(",

Heliotrope Bouquet,Mixed Media? More Like Mismatched Media. Sorry. Not a Fan of the Way This Dress Looks or Fits.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNULWMQ7NWFDB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDQH4YX4,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 9, 2024",Size: 2XColor: Black,,"I thought this dress had potential. It seemed like it would be a good basic look that could be dressed up or down. But, in reality, it is just ""off."" The material for the bodice is a nice stretchy knit - almost like a t-shirt on top. That part isn't so bad. But, the waist hits at an awkward point, and is not flattering. For one thing, the black on the skirt doesn't match the top. The contrast in fabric textures creates a prominent line right across the middle, which accentuates the problematic fit, and adds width. The skirt is made of a stiff poplin-type fabric that doesn't have good drape, so it stands out from your body and adds yet more width. Also WORST OF ALL, it is NOISY. It makes noise when you move. Swoosh swoosh swoosh. UGH. If only the skirt was made of the same fabric as the top, I think it would be so much better. This dress might be cuter on a smaller person, but for a plus size, it just doesn't work.",
Customer,Unflattering Due to High Waist,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37ZLUG24IJHP1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDQH4YX4,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 3, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"I like the two contrasting materials and tones of black, but this dress is unflattering. The issue is that the waist band is very high, starting midway between my bra band and my natural waist. It starts to flow out from that point and it adds unflattering bulk and pounds to the waist and hips, even with shapewear.  A very wide belt can help cinch at the natural waist as long as it works for where the seam aligns on you. I really like the skirt a lot, so I am thinking about just making this just a skirt with a waist band out of the stretchy material.  The top material is a stretchy material that feels nice on, is comfortable and could fit a range of sizes up top. The skirt part is pretty and flowing but prone to wrinkling.  I ordered by the measurements in the size chart and think its fits. The length is great. Due to the stretchy top material, I might have even been able to size down.",
Michelle L. Beck,Love this but runs big!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X8CPVWSAVVKT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDQH4YX4,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 2, 2024",Size: 2XColor: Burnt Henna,,"I really like this dress. I love the color, which is a cinnamon/rust, perfect for the fall. It is made of two fabrics: the top is spandex and the bottom, cotton. The style reminds me of a ballerina: the top is fitted, with short sleeves, and the bottom (with pockets) flare. All you need to do is add some fabulous jewelry and a jacket or cardigan.  There are two things I would warn you about: 1. This dress does run big. So don’t order up like I did. 2. It is long, mid calf (I’m short) so you might consider, as I have, cutting and hemming it. Overall, I am happy about this dress and plan to get a lot of wear out of it.",

I have larger upper arms, and the sleeves of this were cutting into my arms so badly I had to take it off. I'll probably try to fix that sleeve issue later, but oof they hurt. The skirt looks like a wrinkled mess straight out of the bag, but I'm sure could be better with some steaming. I did like the design of this dress! It's good if you need a more modest outfit, say for the office or other such places. It fully covers the chest up to the collarbone, and the stretchy fabric of the top half doesn't squish the girls. However, this dress looks a bit cheap. It looks like I could have picked it up at Target for $25 bucks, which isn't great.",

It is also quite long.  This is built for women who want a large skirt. And, it is also fashioned for women who are around 6 feet tall. It hit just above the ankles of our daughter-in-law who is 6' tall. And, she liked it very much. It's nice to see clothes that accommodate taller women, but can also be worn by those shorter. And, I like the color. Recommended.",

Amazon Customer,"Comfortable, classic style... but fabric is meh",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R213QULVBJF6JS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDQH4YX4,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 25, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"THE GOOD: The top half is a stretch knit in matte black, so not only will it conform to a variety of bodies, it's actually quite comfortable, like wearing a fitted T-shirt. The style is versatile and could be dressed up to formal or down to semi-formal with different accessories. I loved the way it looked with a simple belt as a focal point (pictured). It also has pockets!!  THE BAD: The skirt fabric is very disappointing. It's basically a cotton/poly broadcloth, which looks cheap and wrinkles easily. It's such an odd choice for skirt material, and I have to assume it was chosen because it's extremely inexpensive, but unfortunately it *looks* inexpensive -- more like a $30 dress than an $80 one. I'd hoped this dress would be good for travel, but the skirt wrinkles so badly that it will require steaming or ironing before wearing, so it is probably not suitcase-friendly.  ALSO NOTE: The top is opaque, but the knit is so stretchy that it can show bra bulges, so select your undergarments with care. Also, the sleeves seemed a bit longer on me than on the model. While I like having some sleeve to cover my squishy upper arms, I would have preferred them a couple of inches shorter, since they come down almost to the waist and end up making the silhouette look a bit boxy.  OVERALL: It's a nice enough dress if comfort is a priority and you're willing to iron/steam it before wearing. It has a fair amount of versatility, and the pockets are a big plus. However, I'm really not pleased with the skirt fabric, and I think that limits where I would be willing to wear it.  OFF-LABEL USE: While examining the skirt, I thought, ""What if the wrinkles just weren't visible?"" so I threw on a maxi skirt to see if I could use the dress as a kind of petticoat to fluff it out. It actually worked pretty well, with the knit top looking kind of like the bodysuits that this type of skirt is meant to be worn with. It might still require some ironing to get the big creases out, but I think I could make it work!  SIZING: For reference, I'm 5'4"", 150 lbs., 34G bust (40"" midbust) and I'm wearing a size Large.",9
