Possibly an XS would have worked much better if they had that size, but the Small fits closer to a size 6. Unfortately the cut runs large and so it won't work for thinner petite women who have smaller chests. The neck part is very loose and the top feels like I'm wearing a sack. So not super flattering for me. The waist is stretchable so if you need some room this definitely has it, but unfortunately no amount of tightening with the belt helps as it starts looking bunched up.  Not sure if I will return since I do like how it could look once adjusted. I may have to do a bit of alterations to get it to fit properly. Also the torso runs long as well, so for shorter petite women this may not work for you.",2
