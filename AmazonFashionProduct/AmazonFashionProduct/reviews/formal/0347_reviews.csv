The Good. - Nice weight. Not too heavy and the fabric feels good. - Nice fit. I'm a 16.5"" neck and the large fit me well with not a lot of loose fabric. - Good color on the light blue.  Why I'm sending them back. - The collar is unstructured. It has no collar stays and the edge of collar isn't well defined. - With a tie on, the collar is wrinkled and does not hold its shape. - Under a suit coat, the collar rolls and is wrinkled. - I'm not a fan of the hidden buttons.  Bottom line. - This is a nice long sleeved sport shirt but doesn't work well as a dress shirt if you need to wear a coat and/or tie.",9

Most important to me--the shirt came out of the dryer without wrinkles.  I could not tell for sure in the ad whether the shirt was wrinkle resistant or wrinkle free--I am very happy it's the latter.My only complaint (that missing fifth star) is that the fabric is very light.  I use long sleeve shirts in the winter, and I like a heavier fabric to keep me a little warmer.  This is strictly a personal opinion, so if light material doesn't bother you or you plan to wear it under a jacket or sweater when it's cold, this is a great shirt to consider.",

I got this Men's dress shirt from Coofandy in ""purple"" medium. It fits me well. It's a little loose in the neck and shoulders, and has a little stretch to it which helps cover my not-so-medium middle. I got this because of the ""invisible button"" style (the flap that covers the buttons.) It has a modest collar length.  This is a unique color. It's purple, but... almost more maroon than straight purple.  It has a light feel and resists wrinkling which is helpful. It's 63% polyester, 34% viscose, and 3% spandex and safe for machine wash. They recommend line dry, but I've run it through the dryer without issues.  It has a fabric brand tag high on the collar, which I will probably cut off since I don't like things rubbing on my neck. the sleeves have a usual pair of buttons for loose or tight cuff fit.  I'm happy with this shirt. My wife likes it (thought not with jeans) on me as well. It's a bit on the loose side, which is what I like. If you're between sizes, definitely order down.",6

The purple color is like a ""dusty maroon"" - pretty much like the photos show. The material is soft and lightweight. it's a good quality and hubby liked the hidden button front, because he rarely wears a tie and this makes for a more professional look when wearing with slacks. It also makes this shirt great for wearing with a suit, but can easily be dressed down with jeans, too.  The medium fit him well, the arms a bit long, but his reach is shorter than ""average"" so this is expected. it's also not as fitted in the waist as he usually prefers, but it's not real baggy so it works well for him.
