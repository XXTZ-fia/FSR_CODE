Sabrina Calypso,"Longer than pictured, but that is a good thing.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AUI5FKVG67Z1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7HWB1NB,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Color: Bright RedSize: 10,Verified Purchase,"This is a very nice dress for the money. As many reviewers have said, it is longer than pictured, but that is a good thing because ""midi"" length looks bad on everyone and should not be a thing anyone wears, unless they want to look short and fat. My issue was with the color. I picked the true red, but upon arrival it is clearly magenta. Not red. That means this one had to go back as I really needed red for my event.",

It’s quite stretchy and soft, and the ruching allows you to cover up those areas in your stomach that might be a bit more showy (if that makes you uncomfortable). The cowl neck doesn’t show anything which makes this dress great if you want something a bit more covered. I ate a LOT in this dress and it still looked amazing on me after the end of the night, and it didn’t feel tight, which is incredible. I will admit that I don’t know how long this dress will hold up, so if it falls apart I will adjust the review accordingly, but so far, 5 stars! I did wear a coat over the dress after another lovely lady on here said that the dress can get messed up when driving in the car. I’d advise you do the same just in case. But yeah, great dress!",6

Im really glad I ordered it. It had to travel in my suitcase and this fabric was fabulous for that. Came out of the suitcase ready to wear. The fabric is soft and comfortable and not too hot.

The weight of the material was excellent and the fit was flattering.  The cowl neck draped nicely with minimal fussing, and the length hit me just above the ankles.  Design-wise I would have liked side slits on both sides, but that certainly wasn't a deal breaker, just a personal preference.  Luckily the material had a good amount of stretch because I couldn't get the zipper to work (hence only 4 stars) so I had to slip it on over my head.

The party invitation said cocktail/formal and masquerade party. I have been to these parties for many, many years and always see a spectrum of attire. I wanted something different and holiday-ish and not too over the top - and this dress was perfect! I've recently been a size 10 but have lost weight this year and am down to a 6. Because I was uncertain, I actual bought this dress in too different sizes - purchased the bright red in Medium and the wine red/burgundy in Small. The Medium fight perfectly - couldn't have asked for better! And FYI, the tag in the Medium actually says 8 - go figure.  The velvet fabric was soft on the outside and smooth on the inside, which actually flowed nicely against my pantyhose (did NOT cling to the pantyhose or get stuck, like sometimes happens). And the dress wasn't an overly heavy weight, either - it was perfect. The cowl neck laid very nice as well - not too much, and didn't droop low like they sometimes did. I'd wear this again and would certainly buy in different colors if I had the need!",
