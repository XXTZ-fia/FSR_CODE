Annie Aquino,Pleased,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R288RN1TFGB704/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4Z1HQ7J,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 31, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I recently added a black satin long sleeve shirt to my wardrobe, and it has quickly become one of my go-to pieces for both day and night wear. The shirt boasts a sleek and elegant design that exudes sophistication, making it a versatile choice for a variety of occasions. The satin material gives it a luxurious feel and a subtle sheen that catches the eye, enhancing the overall appeal of the garment.During the day, this shirt pairs beautifully with jeans or casual trousers for a chic, effortless look. Transitioning to evening wear is a breeze; it looks fantastic with dressier pants or skirts, making it perfect for dinners out or more formal events. The long sleeves add a touch of class and are ideal for cooler evenings, providing both style and comfort.The reason I'm giving this shirt a 4-star review, despite its versatility and style, is that it requires a bit of extra care to maintain its appearance. The satin material can be prone to wrinkling and needs to be handled gently, especially when washing and ironing. This isn't a major drawback, but it's something to consider if you're looking for low-maintenance clothing.Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase. It's a beautiful, high-quality shirt that elevates any outfit, whether you're aiming for a casual daytime look or something more elegant for the evening. With the right care, it's a piece that can last and remain a staple in your wardrobe for a long time.",48

I took a moment to contemplate what to do and impulsively thought, “screw it, it’s just a shirt” and went to pin on the name tag. My boss bent closer to me and said, “Don’t do it” right before I made the poke. He was watching this dilemma the whole time and I’m so glad he stopped me. The name tag was not worth the shirt.

I would order the large but the sizing would would be a sloppy fit (2-4 inches larger in the bust!).  However, I will keep it.
