T. Gehman,"Very pretty, should be packaged differently.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HCYH0RSH4JSQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKDVR6FT,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 27, 2025",Color: Grey BlueSize: Small,,"Overall, I am happy with this dress. The fabric is very pretty and has great coverage, so no need for a slip. This would be adorable with a denim jacket for a casual date, or you could dress it up for church or a wedding. The sizing seems pretty accurate, but the top is smocked so you could possibly be in between sizes. I got a small which fits well, but I think I could have also gone up to a medium without it looking too big. If you're in between, I would probably size up. My only complaint is how it was folded in the packaging. There was a fold right across the middle of the bust, which left a pretty distinct crease line. Since it is smocked, it will take some work to get the crease out. But that is a minor detail for what is a very pretty dress!",

The cut is nice, and the dress is well made. It fits as I would expect it to, and while I'm on the larger side, it still does a nice job of keeping it flattering looking. The length is modest, but the fabric isn't super heavy so it will do well in the spring weather. It might be a little heavy for summer, but we'll see how that goes. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.",

Heather,I'm torn about this,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16IA0DA6K6758/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKDVR6FT,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",Color: Wine RedSize: Small,,"I'm torn about this, on one hand I love the wine color and the fluttery sleeves and the length is great, its flowy and lightweight and fitted in the right places, but I feel like the fabric sheen mixed with the design of the fabric in general makes me feel like I'm wearing my grandmas drapes almost. So I go back and forth between feeling like I'm cute or I'm a window treatment. I'm definitely going to have to ask some friends opinions on this. I got a small and I'm 5'5 ,120 pounds, pear shape",
Hogg Wyld,Almost Perfect...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26PLYQRKVJSTL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKDVR6FT,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2025",Color: PinkSize: XX-Large,,"The obvious merits of this dress make it close to perfect!  It is well sewn of quality materials.  The fabric is pleasant against your skin, comfortable, and stretchy.  I love the unique texture that has a reflective, incandescent sheen.  However, I removed one star for two reasons: 1) the pink is ""flat"" and darker in tone rather than pastel and cheery, and 2) the panel below the waist is long, so if you have a tummy, it is more noticeable across that fitted panel.  Add it to the pockets that don't lie completely flat, and you have added visual girth on top of it.  Not the best choice!  Either shorten the panel with pockets, or eliminate the pockets if keeping a longer panel for a more slimming profile.  Still, the dress is pretty and unique.  The size chart is also accurate.  I'm kind of sad that it's so close but not quite in getting it right!",

There is a button on the back for closure and an extra button is provided.  Most of the Pretty Garden clothing I have has a quality to them for reasonable price.  This one is a good piece for church or casual wear.  I will need to hem or wear with heels because it is long.  The dress is 100% polyester and machine washed and dried with no problems.  The manufacturer size chart was accurate for me.  Well done.",

The bodice also felt to large at the same time bc it didn't cinch anything. I really wanted to like this but I'll have to return it.,2

The material seems like a linen finish with pleated layers and slightly ruffled sleeves. Very attractive dress for the price.",
