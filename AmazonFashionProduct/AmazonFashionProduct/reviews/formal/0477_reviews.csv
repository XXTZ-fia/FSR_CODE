Alejandra C.,Runs bigger,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTFR94AI2GOTK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXS7HCB,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Dark Green,Verified Purchase,"Bought a size small. I’m 4’11” and 125 lbs. The green color was beautiful, but when I saw it, I couldn’t stop thinking about Fiona from “Shrek”. The material felt nice, but once I tried it on, it looked and fit me like a dress I could wear to a Renaissance Faire and not to a wedding.",
LJO,"I loved this, but was worried I would be too hot",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCVTU8FQHMQ9Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXS7HCB,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Navy,Verified Purchase,"I loved the look and fit of this dress. I am between a M and L and after reading other reviews and about the fit, I decided to go with a L. I loved the look, but the fabric seemed like it would make me really hot. I live in Georgia and it rarely gets cold enough for me to reasonably wear it, so I returned.",

KinDeborah,Beautiful color and material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RY6EZN7QSCN1H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXS7HCB,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 8, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Navy,Verified Purchase,"What I liked about the dress first off was the color, the ""V"" neckline and that it had long sleeves. It fit well. I'm 5'6, 150 lbs. Also, great party length. You could also wear a tulle skirt under it. What I didn't like about the dress is that it isn't really form fitting like the photo. I have a small waist and what I did was bunch the material up around the waist and used a large rhinestone pin. It looked really cute. The fabric was a little thin and I was afraid of ripping it, But it worked fine.",

It fits her beautifully and has become her go-to choice for networking events. The fabric feels luxurious, and the deep color really stands out in a crowd. She appreciates how it strikes the right balance between professional and stylish. It's always nice to see her feeling confident and comfortable.",
KCA,"Cute dress, cheap material",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R301829OOVAJGK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXS7HCB,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 12, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Burgundy,,"This is a very cute dress for dressier occasions in fall/winter.  I ordered this in the dark red color and it's so pretty. It fits true to size and even has a decent bit of stretch to it.  It's a little on the thin side and i would recommend wearing a slip with it. For this price I would expect a slightly higher quality material. It really does feel cheap.  It's very cute, but seems like a dress you could get for half this price.",3
Lorraine,"Super soft dress, length isn't the most flattering on me",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AOMU1P1RFO35/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXS7HCB,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 10, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Burgundy,,"This dress is so soft and comfortable! It'll definitely keep you warm on a slightly chilly fall or winter night. It's a little shapeless, but nothing that a belt can't fix. I normally wear a 12/14 dress and my measurements are 42""/35""/42"". The dress is pretty stretchy, so the XL fits just fine as expected based on the size chart. I don't know that I'd wear this dress to a holiday party because it kind of reads more victorian nightgown than festive to me. Maybe if it was a full length dress or knee length then it would look better on me, haha. I'm 5'4"" and the dress hits me mid-calf. My husband mentioned that it could make a good Mother Gothel cosplay though. :)",7
K Hancock,Very fashionable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R177BN9YCAWVRO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXS7HCB,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 7, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Peacock Blue,,"This dress fits perfectly and is very pretty.  The velvet fabric makes it fancy, and it is very comfortable to wear.  I ordered it to wear on an upcoming cruise and it doesn't wrinkle much when packed.  This dress is very nice and suitable for most dressy occasions, including church.  It is also quite slimming, so I'm comfortable wearing it.  The fabric is high quality and the construction is excellent.",2
kc10squared,Pretty Peacock,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KFUMUFBDELNL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXS7HCB,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 6, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Peacock Blue,,"This color is really pretty and true to the stock photos. I am 5'9"" and usually wear a size 6/small in most dresses. I am tall, but have a relatively petite/narrow frame. Based on the size chart I ordered a size medium. The medium fits me. Given the fabric I could have probably gone with a small, but the sleeves are just barely long enough and I'm glad I have the slight extra length from the size medium. The dress is not lined, the seams are neat, and the smocked waist and cuffs are comfortable.",3
