Trinity Monroe,Loved it!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV3N555V1BSKU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5HB3GKN,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Darkgreen,Verified Purchase,"I loved this dress so much. I ordered it in I think a size XL and it fit perfectly. The color all around was a very lovely shade of green that looked great. It was a little bit lighter than what was shown in the picture but that worked out great. I loved the look of the bottom of the dress with its lace handkerchief hem. I had bought this dress for my homecoming dance and I do not regret it. The dress popped even when the background in the photo was green as well. It was a very comfortable dress to wear, although it was a little hard to zip up and unzip by yourself so make sure you have a friend to help you with that. Overall I would totally recommend this dress to anyone whether it’s for a dance, wedding, date, or even just to go out.",

But this is not to take anything away from this dress. It's really a quality dress for the money. The fabric is surprisingly soft and flowy. I loved the asymmetrical hem, too. I found the fit true to size and very flattering on my petite but pear-shaped body. It was a bit longer on me than on the women featured in the pictures, but I didn't mind that since the skirt is not voluminous.",

I got it in white as my wedding Reception dress since it was a HOT August wedding, it was nice to change into this cocktail dress as the dancing kicked up and the sun set. It stretchy, so very comfortable, flowy and fun, and there are no issues with wearing a regular bra. Or, very little - yes, the sleeves are lace so you can see through them technically, but it's so hard to  notice. My wedding color was navy blue, so I simply asked my sisters to wear any dress they liked in a blue color - one of my sisters bough this same dress in navy and and also loved how comfy it is. Highly recommend!",5

However, I was very disappointed to receive an obviously used dress with no tag, potentially machine-washed, because it has threads sticking out and there are snags on the skirt part (see the pictures). It also is very flimsy, I expected the lace to be more sturdy. I am not sure if the quality was bad from the beginning, or if I received someone else's returned order in such a poor condition. In any case, the dress as I have it is unusable and extremely disappointing. There should be some quality control either when they make it or when someone returns it, because this is really unacceptable. The color is true to the pictures and very beautiful. It also runs really big: I am in no way the smallest person alive, but I ordered XS and it was a bit wide and long for me. I'd rather have it smaller, but I could work with the current size if the dress itself was not in such a poor condition.",2
