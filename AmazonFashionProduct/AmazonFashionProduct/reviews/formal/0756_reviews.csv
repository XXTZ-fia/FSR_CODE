The caftan was even more sparkly in person, and the hidden belt allows you to define a waistline inside the flowy outfit.  I’m only 5’1” and, as I’d expected, the gown was a little too long on me. However, tightening the belt kept the front from dragging the floor and wearing platform shoes minimized the drag of the back. I wore this on an extremely cold day and so wore a black undershirt underneath, which worked fine. The gown would be quite comfortable in summer, though, as it’s very lightweight.  The color was a vivid deep blue, just as pictured.",27
