He just started wearing 18 month clothes and the 12-18 month fit him perfectly (he's about 29 inches long and 20 lbs).  The onesie itself was very soft and he didn't seem uncomfortable at all. I had him in it all day and he didn't sweat from being overly hot or whine from discomfort. I did not use the vest since he was given a bib by family that would have covered it, but the vest was a different material than the onesie (probably polyester). It's smooth but it doesn't seem breathable. Pants were cute too, but I don't think it was the same material as the onesie. It felt a little more coarse, similar to men's suit pants and was probably more of a polyester/cotton blend (completely guessing, but it definitely wasn't as soft as the onesie). Definitely great outfit for spring weather.  The only (very minor) complaint I have is that it was more of a off white, maybe cream color, than bright white. I had bright white shoes and socks which looked whiter than the suit. It ended up looking mismatched together and I didn't use the shoes and socks, but my baby doesn't walk yet so him being barefoot didn't look out of place at least. Still really cute and unless you have something that is really white right next to it, it's not something noticeable. I didn't think anything of it until I put my baby in his whole outfit right before his baptism.",2
