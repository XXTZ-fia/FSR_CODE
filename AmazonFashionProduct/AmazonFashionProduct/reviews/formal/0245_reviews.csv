The ad tells you to size up one level for a looser fit.  However, these clearly run very small.  I sized up from a 2XL to a 3XL.  The 2XL claims to support a 52"" chest, which is what I wear in Suits and Sport Coats.  However, given that this was a foreign item, I took their warning and sized up to the 3XL which is supposedly a 55"" chest.

A. H.,Blazer Fits Okay,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UVRK8JUPK80K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXRW3KD,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 30, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"This blazer fits okay but not perfect. It’s a little small in that when I raise my arms it rides up with me and looks a little short. When I stand still, it looks like it fits okay. It buttons well, sits across my shoulders and the length is good. I think it’s probably a little tight across the shoulders but if I went larger it would be too big other places. The blazer itself is nice looking. I like the way it falls and feels. It was delivered without any wrinkles so I could wear it right away. It’s a nice blazer, I just wish it fit me better.",
LoganFam,Very nice love the color and quality wry good choice,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R65H1FWK64KWU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXRW3KD,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 30, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Wine,,I love the look of this very good quality jacket. It’s light which was a shock because it’s got strong deep rich color and feels very comfortable and of high quality. The fit is also almost perfect for my tall and fit husband that’s 6’3. The stitching is very well done and this jacket is for sure a very good value and choice for a nice outing or special occasions.,

I'd recommend sizing up 1 size for a better fit.",
James M.,The one-button closure gives it a modern look.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGPR6OFNR9QEL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXRW3KD,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 24, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Light Gray,,"I'm impressed with the COOFANDY Men's Casual Blazer. The slim fit is perfect for my build and it looks fantastic on. The fabric feels high-quality and it's surprisingly lightweight, making it comfortable to wear even on warmer days. The one-button closure gives it a modern look, and the pockets are well-placed and deep enough to hold essentials. Whether I'm dressing it up for a business casual event or pairing it with jeans for a night out, this blazer always looks sharp.  I'm so glad I received this blazer to review. It's exceeded my expectations in terms of style, comfort, and overall quality. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile and stylish blazer to add to their wardrobe.",
