She picked it out for me.  It was beautiful!  It fit so well, very comfortable, looked so pretty and made me feel beautiful.  The quality was top notch.  It was stretchy enough for movement and comfort and the material and lining was made well enough that I didn’t need to wear a slip.  I’m so happy with this dress and happy that my daughter chose it.",4

This was an amazing value and I felt great when I wore it. The jacket is just ok but still nice (you can substitute a shawl or just wear the dress). The sequins did not fall off. True to size (medium) and very flattering. I bought a top from the same manufacturer and was equally pleased. In total, less the $100 for both!",

It was dressy, fit very well, and I felt pretty wearing it.  As other reviewers have noted, the sequins started to come off. One other thing, is that the shrug was very wrinkly when I got it and it took some doing to get the wrinkles out. I believe that’s very good value for the money. The zipper was very easy to use, and the item is good quality.",6

It had just the right amount of sparkle and the option of the light cover was spot on.  Sadly, I had to return it as the gold was more of a champagne gold, not the more metallic bright gold I needed (specified for a themed party).  Still wanted to keep it, but I don't think I would have any occasion to wear it.  I would definitely recommend if you are looking for this type of dress.",

On the last day ṭo order and receive before the big day, I chose this dress.  It fit perfect, it forms to your body comfortably and smooths fatty areas (Lol). I was very nervous and felt out of place ( this is only the 2 dress worn in my adult life). I arrived at the venue and several of the other guests complimented on how beautiful the dress is. Even though I'll probably never wear it again, it will hang in my closet forever. Material is stretchy and lightweight.",

Don't country on ""ready to wear"". Steaming didn't seem to work. It needs a low, low heat iron, with A DAMP PRESSING CLOTH between the garment and the iron.  You don't want to melt the sequins.  Purchased in the darker grey, and the jacket appear almost violet in some light, but is the appropriate grey in other light. It just depends. Fits true to size.  It is lovely, will wear for New Year's Eve Party.",
JJ,Nice dress but only ok “jacket”,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RV21ZOPT05/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8NBQPPR,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 22, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black Silver,Verified Purchase,"The dress is really nice. Good quality w/zipper in the back. The second piece that I’ll call the jacket for lack of a better word, gets easily wrinkled. So it gives an overall frumpy look especially in front where it needs to be more slick in order to keep the tapered look desired. The material just tends to flop around the chest area w/out any real form. Other than that. It’s a good 4 stars",4

Love how shiny it is. I’m 5’4” and this hit just below knee rather than above as shown on the model. 140lbs so ordered the large. I think I may be able to size down. Jacket is very cute from the front, I feel it’s a little boxy from the side and back. Sheer with matching sparkle on the sleeve cuffs. Purchased for a Mother of the Groom dress. Undecided whether I will wear for the wedding or not, but keeping it anyway as I like it so much and the price is definitely right! Much less expensive than other dresses of similar quality. Has a little stretch and is much more comfortable than other dresses with sequins. Not itchy or scratchy at all as it is fully lined.",15

AB,Pretty sequin dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXJZBFJID8VFG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8NBQPPR,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 17, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Purple,Verified Purchase,"I bought the burgundy sequin dress in XL. I usually wear a 14 dress as I'm about 5'4""+ and 160 lbs with a large chest (40D). The XL was fairly roomy and there is some stretch to the fabric. The dress is comfortable except for under the arms. Without the jacket on, the sequins scratch my sensitive skin on the arms. The length of the dress is just right, falling just at my knee. The jacket is very nice-- fairly sheer but adds a good look and a bit of warmth. The sequins on the cuffs of the jacket are a perfect touch. The jacket even has darts for shaping. I wish I could buy the jacket by itself! The zipper works very smoothly and I could zip it myself because there is enough stretch. The pattern of the sequins is quite pretty. If the lining fabric was a bit stiffer or thicker I think it would be more smoothing for lumpy bodies. My photos were taken without any fancy under garments. I would recommend something smoothing underneath if you're shaped like me.",56

Jean,Beautiful,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19R5SHNAASNVM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8NBQPPR,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 22, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Silver,Verified Purchase,This is a beautiful well made outfit. I purchased it for my son’s wedding in April “24”. I bought the silver because I felt it looked sophisticated but not too over the top. I am very pleased with this dress and jacket.  The dress fits beautifully and is filled with small sequins. It actually hides my flaws. I purchased a medium and a large and found the large to be the better fit. I like looser comfortable clothes so my purchases are based on the comfy fit.  The jacket is a very light weight sheer material with 3/4 sleeve with matching dress pattern on the end. Very pretty.  The only con I see is the jacket color is not the same as the dress. You can actually see it in the pictures if you pinch your phone screen big. It still looks beautiful tho. I also bought a facintor hat that arrives tomorrow. I bought a silver one that is simple and elegant and will add a pretty touch for my son’s wedding. I am happy with my purchase. I would recommend this dress for the look and price point.  One last thing…I am 5”1 and weigh between 125 and 130. I have the dreaded belly that fluctuates in size from eating habits. I also have small back bulge. This dress hides your little flaws.,37

The dress itself was comfortable and had plenty of stretch,. It was also lined and required no special undergarments.  I ordered up a size so it wouldn't be clingy. The jacket really wasn't my style so I ordered an inexpensive chiffon shawl to wear with it.There were a couple of times that sequins would get hooked together near the hem, but it was easily fixed.  I also noticed a few sequins on the floor when I took it off,  but there were no noticeable bare spots where it lost them.",5

I ordered a 16. I am only five feet tall and 173 lbs. I am not very chesty and have a thick waist, but the dress was still flattering. I received several compliments on it at my niece's wedding.  It might be too casual for the mother-of-the-bride, but if you're a guest of a wedding and looking for comfort while dancing, you might be happy with this purchase. The jacket drapes nicely and helps hide things a little, but in this picture part of the jacket is tucked behind my brother so you get a fuller view of my stomach. I still wanted to post a picture even though I feel it does not do the dress justice. One more thing, I ordered a pink dress. In person the dress was more of a rose gold, especially the sequences. The sheer portion of the dress is a pinkish/light salmon which I loved. I wore rhinestone shoes and rhinestone earrings which looked lovely with the rose gold hue of this dress.",23
