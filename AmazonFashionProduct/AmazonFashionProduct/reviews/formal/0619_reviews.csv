I have to admit, I have never owned a knitted polo shirt, and the feel of this one when I put it on felt a bit odd. The sizing was good, which is a plus. The tag says it is 95% viscose (rayon) and 5% polyester. I guess I have become so accustomed to the feel of my traditional cotton or cotton blend polo shirts that this combination of materials seems kind of foreign to me. The large knit tends to make the material sag somewhat giving it a bit of a sloppy feel.

I ordered a size Large, it fit pretty well, so if you're in between sizes I'd recommend getting the size larger instead. I do think the silhouette could be a bit better shaping, like bring in the shoulders and waste a bit to create a more muscled look on the arms and shaping out the torso without making you look fat. Small critique aside, I really like the polo. I found no loose stitching, weird marks, damage of any kind and I 100% plan to make this a fun shirt to wear on daylight dates with my girlfriend.",

JellyBeans,Stylish knit shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRBLIUDFL49G1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9H4NV7J,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 13, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Turquoise,,"I like textured solid color shirts that have subtle design and this shirt has a very nice knit design that makes it stand out. My husband likes blue color although it is little more brighter and bold than I was expecting. He is 5'10"" and 195 pounds and wears large and this shirt in large size fits him very well. I usually get him 44-45 bust size and the size chart was mapping to XL but I still got large and it fits great.  The shirt is stitched well and design is striking. The fabric however does not feel soft and comfortable for long day wear. I was hoping that washing it would soften the fabric but unfortunately it did not. My husband prefers wearing this with white undershirt which gives a nice contrast and also prevents fabric touching the skin. This will be a nice shirt for party and casual wear.",
Orion Winder,"This is one great shirt, and it'll be perfect for our hot summers down here in the Deep South",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QRTCW270AGMH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9H4NV7J,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 13, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Turquoise,,"I've never been one to normally buy clothing online, as I normally like to feel the fabric, try it on for fit before I buy such. Since on VINE I've gotten a few things to try, and mostly been quite pleased with the results. This shirt is PERFECT, for my tastes, feel and style. I love it! It's very comfortable, I really like the knit feel which breathes great for our summer heat, and the fit was right on; even with what I'm told is wide shoulders. I'm 6', about 185 give or take a few depending on the day, and the large fit perfectly. And I really like the vibrant blue color of the shirt; though I'd call it more of a dark turquoise myself. It's seems extremely nice for the price, when I compare it to others similar that I have, that I paid much more for. I've no qualms about giving this 5 stars, and that will only change if something affecting the wear or other flaws shows up. Right now, after a good wash it's great. And it does have the extra button that normally comes with my nicer shirts.",
Sara,Great Fit But VERY Uncomfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXUSZ8OLFIPGM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9H4NV7J,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 10, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Turquoise,,"The color is more of a Caribbean Blue which is lighter than a normal blue. Not easily wearable as a professional shirt but definitely can pass for a nicer party shirt or for a nice dinner. The fit was perfect and true to size. The bottom of the shirt is stretchy and cuffed so it doesn't ride up which is what you want in a more fitted polo. The sleeves are a perfect length. Having said all this, I'm not a fan of the design pattern or the quality of the fabric. The design pattern looks good, however the holes go all the way through the shirt so if you look closely you can see your skin through the shirt where it stretches on your body. I wasn't a fan of that. Additionally, the feel of the shirt on my body felt VERY uncomfortable, almost a scratchy feeling. It definitely wasn't the soft feel you crave in a shirt that stretches. All in all the color, fit, and look was good but the hole design and quality took away from it.",

I appreciate that it's soft, comfortable, and stretchy. Certainly, it's a shirt that could be worn year-round but it emits a sort of summer feel with its breezy presentation. The color is dynamite. I seldom see this type of aquamarine color in a shirt. Glad I discovered this gem!",

That's not a great color for me and after trying it on I didn't think it was for me.  That said if you like bright colors like that this would stand out and on the right skin color could look great.  My pale European skin washes me out with this color.However, it did fit well and the material was nice and felt good.  It was a comfortable fit and appeared to be well made.  As a short sleeve shirt you can wear through the spring, summer and autumn and I'd be happy to do so if I felt the color was more my style.  I may try and see if i can get it in a different color but only this one was available at the time of selection.",
