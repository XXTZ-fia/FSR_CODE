Beetle girl,For great and lots of compliments,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XCDYJTAE1V5N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4L7N3SZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 4, 2024",,Verified Purchase,I’m 5 ft and was 165lb (36DD) at the time. I got an XL in the olive green color and it fit great. It’s a stretchy material so I had plenty of room and it still looked fitted. It was easy to iron and I loved the pockets. I didn’t even need to wear shapewear with it. Would buy again in another color for another event. Was very flattering on.,5
GBM,Love this dress!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24OA9RAJ2A26N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4L7N3SZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 21, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Navy Blue,Verified Purchase,"This dress exceeded my expectations! I receive so many compliments every time I wear it. The fabric is structured but has stretch. The dress is true to size,  accentuated my curves, is very comfortable, and is professional.

JoJo,Still Out on This Dress but Husband Loves It.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34VKSD9U2UNJT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4L7N3SZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 12, 2020",,Verified Purchase,"I am still out on this dress.  I think my problem is that I do not have the correct under garments to wear with it.  The zipper works just fine without me in it, but there seems to be a problem when it is on.  It really is not too tight in the waist but rather it seems that the seam around the waist, which the zipper has to pull through, is difficult to get zipped up when it is on.  Ladies this is a put on the dress before you do any makeup as it goes on over your head.  There is a moment when I think this is not going to fit while going over my head and trying to get my arms into it, but then once that happens it slips on down with no problem.  I would much rather have seen the zipper for this dress placed in the back.  What is up with the side zipper?  By this I mean it does not go all the way up so to help in anyway.  The zipper is just placed in the middle of the side.  Therefore, I really don't see its function.  The material is thick and the tie on it is cute.  Once on, it looks rather smart, but you run the risk of getting makeup on it if you do your makeup first before getting it on over your head.  I usually do my makeup first and then dress.  If you have your hair all done before you put the dress on, it is really going to be a mess by the time you get it on over your head.  There is a slight give to the material.  The navy blue is a solid navy.  It is comfortable after you get it on, but I would suggest to have a great shape wear ready to try on with it.  Mine is on order but has not arrived, so I have not taken a photo of me in it yet.  My husband loved it the moment I came out of the bathroom when trying it on, although he too had a problem helping me get past the waist seam with the zipper.  This is a very form fitting dress showing all your curves.  I am 5 feet 5 inches and weigh around 180 pounds and bought the xxl.  I do not have a problem in my stomach area or hip to speak of.  My waist is 34, my hips are 42 and my bust is 44.  It is has been so long since I bought a dress instead of a skirt that  I am not sure what size in a dress I usually wear but I would say a 14.  My problem is up top.  I am stuffed into a 38DD bra.  I usually wear a 12 in pants depending on the brand.  The length of the dress just covers my knees.  I don't think I will be putting this dress in a dryer anytime soon.  It came quickly and was packaged well.  You can wear this material fall and winter for sure and probably summer if you are in air conditioning.  Sleeves are 3/4.  It is a great dress to have in your closet for a funeral, church, the office, or any special occasion.  Jewelry really shows up nicely on the Navy color.  It looks like a very simple design, but the dress takes on a more formal look when on, especially with heels.  I wish this dress came in even larger sizes to accommodate for any shrinkage.  I will update with a photo as soon as I get the correct under garment of shape wear to put on beneath it.  Hope this review helps.",33
Joann Granata,xXL 5’7 188 LBS,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSQW1TPKZ8CSL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4L7N3SZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 11, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: Hot Pink,Verified Purchase,"Beautiful dress, It doesn’t look cheap unless you make it look cheap 🤣.. I have it in black too  same size . If you’re short and you get it tight , if it rides up ( I was 210 pounds when I first wore my black dress) I was tugging it down a lot ( not elegant) .. I’m 5’7 so it wasn’t falling in that sweet spot below the knee  If You are short, you can get away with it being tight because it will still be long and not uncomfortable . I’d say if your big busted don’t worry about the top , it stretches and the girls are covered up & it looks FANTASTIC on curvy girls , Big hips , Big legs , Big tummy .. doesn’t matter it covers a world of sins this dress .. If your thin with not a ton of shape I’d say size down ,way down !!the dress  is not flattering when it’s too baggy  on that body type  . In my opinion it looks frumpy . Now we are all beautiful darlings .. BUT id say if you get this dress super tight & your a big girl ( I was 215 when I wore my black dress in xxl)  , It loses its charm , it’s a throwback to the Jackie O & the pinup era ..If you’re going for Jackie don’t stuff yourself in .. If you wanna be painted on the side of a WW11 plane get it Snug .. Google Joan Holloway from madmen for some inspiration ! Elegant princess kate .. This dress can do both .. Take the time to Hem it if you think it’s too long !  Believe me it’s worth it  This review is long as hell - I hope it made sense I have ADHD lol …bottom line I’m 189 in this video , it could be tighter but I’m wearing it to church & light colors or bright colors have a tendency to look bad if it’s tight .. I wore same dress in black at 215 ish pounds same size XXL - pick a size depending on your shape and purpose of the dress .. people complimented me , a lot .. My husband when I put it in said WOW!!! He never gets that enthusiastic lol .. very genuine reaction",66

I’m 5 foot 6 inches, 140#, curvy, ordered a medium (which is my usual size) and it was very very tight and did not look good or professional as a result and I can’t wear it to work.  This is not a good look if you are curvy unless you love having your caboose stick out like a sore thumb.  I’m sadly going to have to return it.  I think even a large would be far too snug at the waist, hips, and behind.  The top was snug but fit fine. But it looked really bad from the waist down and also rode up on me.",4

I was in love with this dress.  The material was nice and sturdy,  it fits great, looks good, hugs your curves nicely. To get into the dress is a fight for dear life, but I loved it so much.  So when it got stretched out I purchased two more recently and the material is not as sturdy.  It is thinner than the first time I purchased it.  I still love how the dress fits because I am a plus size person and I like when I can find a dress that agrees with my body type, but the material is thinner and my fear is that it will get stretched out even faster this time because there is no zipper at the back, only at the side under the arm which does not help the fight.  I hope maybe the makers can do some sort of adjustment in the future to make the dress a little easier to get into.  I wear size 40 DD bra, I have a size 38 high waist line and size 55 hips.

Figure hugging without being tight or tacky. Very 'Mad Men' style, fantastic color, reminiscent of late 1950s American fashion. Stylish little tie at neck. Nice fabric, though may have a tendency to hold onto wrinkles. (Was not ironed before photos.) Sleeve length is terrific for upper arms of a certain age.""  Additional observations: ""I recommend it be worn with a smoothing undergarment or slip to keep it from riding up or clinging to underwear. Pointless pockets: I plan to remove them. They are unnecessary and are visible underneath the garment.""  Large fits her well. She is 5'7"", 151 lbs, 36DD, 40-29-40. This will be essentially a work dress for her and also a dress she'll wear for presentations and introductions on stage. It's not an especially sexy dress, but it's a feminine and trim dress that reminds me of the days long gone when women and men both looked great in the office. It hits a great note blending femininity and professionalism. For that purpose, 5 stars.  EDIT: We bought two more in Merlot and UPS Brown (see additional photos). The Merlot is lovely. The Brown was her idea, and I can't say I've warmed much to it, but the great style of the dress comes through anyway.  Reviewing these photos, I think the look seems to recall a classic stewardess style. Also, the tie arrives loose, which allows for either a bow (shown with green dress) or knotted with loose ends (merlot and brown). I prefer the latter, because it breaks up the bustline.",55

I don’t think I have ever bought a dress in this material. It is very much stretchy like mostly spandex so it will hug your curves. If you are a curvy woman you might want to get a larger size as the pockets might not stay closed. It is well made. The material is thick and stretchy. No slit on back but bc of stretch it’s not necessary and it has a hidden side zipper. It is hand wash and dry.  I would love this dress in a ponte material. Def would buy in other colors. Again very well made and beautiful color. I received many compliments on the dress. I recommend it and will purchase another style from this company. Dark green as I expected. Buying clothes on Amazon can be tricky. Hope this helps if you are thinking of purchasing the dress.,17
