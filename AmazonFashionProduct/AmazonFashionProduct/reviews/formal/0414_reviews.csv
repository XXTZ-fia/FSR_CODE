It’s a little hard to pull over the head if you’re busty so I suggest stepping into it then pulling it up over the hips. Why I ordered it is because I have been missing the natural waistline in dresses for years now and finally found a dress that has a waist for an hourglass figure - no more empire waist which doesn’t suit anyone busty as the false waist often intrudes on the chest and doesn’t highlight the natural hour glass figure. I hope to order other colors and am happy with the elegant and ladylike look of this . Also, long sleeves are beautiful and just what my dermatologist suggested since I’ve had skin cancer and can’t show arms in the hot summer sun ! Covers up nicely and delicately, this is perfect !",5
