Without the jacket, it reads like my middle-school show choir dress (which, thinking back, might have had a similar cut). With the jacket it’s better, but still not really chic. The style isn’t for every body type, I guess! (For comparison, I’m 5’1”, I have broad shoulders for my proportions, an average-length torso, and my measurements hover around 32/27/33.) I’m not taking a star off just because the style doesn’t suit me, though, since everyone will wear it differently.  The dress does seem to be made well out of good materials, and if you like the style, it’s very pretty! The skirt is flowy and both the skirt and the bodice are lined. The sequined top and jacket feel slightly heavy in a good way, like I expect of clothes with beaded embroidery. The sequins look nice quality, not at all like cheap costume sequins that break and get everywhere. This dress manages to combine a feeling of celebration with a demure attitude, so the “mother of the bride” label in the product title makes complete sense.",

It looks good with the jacket or without. Overall, I’m pleased.  I normally wear a medium or large (size 10 top, size 12 bottom). I’m giving it 4 stars because it is definitely snug at the torso.

It's very modest but still with a beautiful drape and flow. The top is sparkly but not overly much. It's the perfect blend of pretty but not taking the spotlight. It's really light and flowy but maintains a good structure which can be hard to find in a dress. As someone that generally runs really hot I appreciate that aspect maybe more than anything else. I love that there's a separate little cardigan. It gives options and the extra layer brings dimension it might otherwise be missing. Overall I love it and would buy it again if the occasion arose.,

The sequences are organized in a scale-like pattern, which may not look good with some colors but complements the peacock blue of my dress beautifully.  My biggest concern for this dress is the fact that it runs on the small end, and the way the sequins are sewn on, means the dress has little stretch to compensate for fact it runs on the small end.

I do like this style and material a lot because they are forgiving and the fabric travels well. Still, for the price point of nearly $100, I expected the quality to be higher. I ordered a small, and it runs a tad big, in my opinion.",

The blue is akin to a midnight blue, very elegant. Well-made, comfy, soft, true to size but not overly tight (medium, 5'1, 135lbs). Looks nice with and without the jacket. Price seems fine, given it can be worn to most anything, from wedding to date night, etc. The sequins do make zipping a tad tedious, as it gets caught up in the decor, but it's only a minor nuisance.",
Donna,A beautiful Dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35P4OENUPWBA3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8YJ5L99,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 25, 2024",Color: Dark PurpleSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"I wasn’t sure what to expect because at the time of purchase there was only one other review but I have bought from this company before and it was a nice quality product. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this dress was and seems like good quality. I was also very happy to find that the top is somewhat stretchy and the jacket is as well so there’s plenty of give to it but still retains its shape. The bottom is sheer but with there’s an inner panel for most of the length so only a small section is sheer.  I ordered a 2XL because often these dresses from China tend to run small and I am happy with the fit for me. I normally fit a size 14 and on the model is shows a different length but I am shorter so it comes down much longer on my legs but I am okay with that. Overall, it’s perfect for what I needed in a short time and I received it in 2 days with Amazon Prime, it’s a beautiful color, quality and fit. If the price had been a little lower I would have considered buying a 2nd one in another color because I have 2 weddings to attend. However, I would buy this again in the future in another color, If needed.",9
Stephanie H.,Good quality dressy dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SLW0WIRM9WY8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8YJ5L99,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 22, 2024",Color: BlackSize: XX-Large,,"I got this dress intending to use it on a cruise for a dressy dinner. So many dressy dresses look too ""mother of the bride"", and I wanted something dressy, but versatile. I do like the midi length, the lined flare skirt and the sequimed top and jacket. The dress and jacket are both lined and feel like good quality. Since it is a little stretchy, I just pulled it over my head to put it on, but it does have a full back zipper. The black dress is appropriate for a cocktail party, dinner or any dress-up event. I think that the jacket will also  be nice to use with dressy slacks or a different skirt. I ordered this in XXL which seemed like an appropriate choice. Although I can wear it, the top and jacket are snug. I would feel more comfortable with a little looser fit. I do have to say that in spite of the snug top, it looks really great with another dressy shawl that I already own. If you are considering this dress and the measurements are close, I'd recommend sizing up for more comfort.",

It is perfect for a wedding guest.  Ordered a size 12 and it fit perfectly.  No alterations needed.  So many of these types of dresses come with a see through jacket but this one is not see through and that is exactly what I was looking for.  Nice quality.  Sparkly jacket/top.,2
