There is, however, a little snap at the neckline of the dress to keep the girls mostly hidden. I'm sure this would be a different for larger bust measurements.

On the X-Large the sleeves were humongous and too long. Also no matter what I did I could not get the wrinkles out of the pleated area so I had to take it to the cleaners. To me the pleats need to be a little more defined, but overall I chose the turquoise and  received plenty of compliments.",5
