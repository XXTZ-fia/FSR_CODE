This dress is LONG and stretchy and sooo comfortable. I love that the sleeves actually go to my wrist, the hem kisses the floor when I'm in flats, and the neckline is modest without making me feel choked. Since it's so stretchy it doesn't really need the side-zipper, but I suppose that's good to have in case I gain weight and can't slide it on with the ease I currently can. Just needs pockets to be perfect.",2

Great price for such a nice dress! The material is good quality and hangs nicely. It has kind of a stretchy, smooth, nylon-y feel, which is relatively heavy. I haven't worn it around much, but I anticipate the fabric will be at least somewhat wrinkle resistant. Comfortable.  The fit is perfect. For reference, I'm about 5'8 and 120 lbs, and I got a SMALL (I'm not sure why Amazon is saying I got an X-large--that's not correct). So happy to find a dress that's actually long enough!  I didn't notice the side zipper at first, which made it unnecessarily difficult to get on. But with the zipper, it's very easy. No more difficult back zippers from my previous temple dresses!  Keep in mind that this dress is not lined. The material is decently thick, so it's certainly not transparent, but you'll still probably need a slip underneath to mask underwear lines. The only real downside to this dress is NO POCKETS. so keep that in mind if you're using this as a temple dress like me (thankfully, I have a pocket in my slip).",6
