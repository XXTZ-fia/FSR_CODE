Mom to Many,"Very nice dress, soft and comfortable with lots of fullness",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21JX8GS383KA1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7TS7GGK,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 13, 2024",Color: Blue - Daisy TulleSize: 4-5,,"I am really impressed with this dress for the price. It is really lovely and unlike many dresses that have a tulle overlay, this one really is as full and pretty as the picture shows it to be. It comes in lots of pretty color choices, both solid colored and with pretty little daisies on the tulle. The knit under dress is a nice weight and really well sewn. It is soft, stretchy and comfortable. The daisies give this such a pretty look and my daughter (who tends to be sensitive to scratchy material) loves the sleeves (which are overlaid with tulle to match the skirt of the dress but have the knit inside them, keeping the dress both soft and warm)  This does run very large so you may want to consider sizing down. My daughter typically wears a 4/5 and that is what we ordered but this dress is really large on her- more of a 6/6X and she will need to grow into it.  This dress is really lovely and full, well constructed and soft at a really reasonable price point. We will be ordering this in other colors to wear this winter. It is beautiful enough for special occasions but comfortable enough to be worn to school if you have a child who really likes a dressy look.",
