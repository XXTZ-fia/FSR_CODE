There was nothing formal about the dress! It was pretty and fit well, but cheaply made.  I would wear this for a night at a lounge or club but not for any type of upscale formal event. It is going back!",
Luisanna Granillo,Love the emerald color!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21FZQFIJ9XLES/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXJKPK2,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 27, 2024",Color: GreenSize: Large,,"I used this dress for my brother’s backyard wedding. It was really comfortable and the one sleeve stayed in place, I worry with designs like this that they will slip off but it stayed. I also really liked how there was an opening in the leg area, it made it more elegant. The material of the dress was a bit thin, I wish it was a bit thicker so that it fit better. It was easy to wash it and take care of it.",

It is thin and ribbed and seems like a casual material so it is not stiff and formal feeling (even though the style of the dress is kind of sexy and a little more formal.  So its like you are dressing up but not really because the material is more casual. The medium is good for me - I am 5'7"" AND 150 lbs.  Nice slit, comfortable and looks good.",
Penelope,Order your normal size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZZZSD44XUBFI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXJKPK2,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 20, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Small,,This is a bit loose.  But the concept is very nice.  Material is ribbed and the slit in the front is conservative so this makes a nice going out dinner dress which I love.  Soft and the off the shoulder is nice and sits well on the shoulder.,
