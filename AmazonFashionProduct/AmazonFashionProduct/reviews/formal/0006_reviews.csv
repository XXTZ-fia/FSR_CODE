For the price, I feel it is a nice suit.  One issue we ran into is with the sizing of the pants. The XS has an elastic waistband and while they fit her, an extra 1” would be better. We tried a size S as well, but the pants were huge in the waist. No elastic and no belt loops so there was nothing we could do short of using a safety pin. I ordered a second set in a size small thinking maybe it was a fluke with the first pair; however, the pants once again did not have elastic and were too big in the waist. We wound up returning the smalls and kept the XS. She is happy with the suit so that’s good enough for me.  For reference, she is 5’8, 124 lbs, 28” waist, 28DD",

What many have already said, I agree with. This is a pretty nice suit for the price. Its polyester. Jacket is lined. Pants are not.  There are no pockets on the pants. It is a SLIM cut.  It is also oddly or dare I say mis-sized.  The pants and jacket don’t match size wise.  The pants are too big while the jacket is too small.  The arms of the jacket are too tight and you can barely raise your arms.  While the pants are literally fall off and dragging the floor.  I am 5”6 175lbs.  I typically wear a solid size 10. (Target,,Old Navy).  I wear size Large shirts.  Bust is ample size 36 DD.  I first purchased a Large. It did not work.  It can be worn. But very uncomfortable.  Jacket was so tight I can’t raise my arms properly. Arms too tight and the pants thigh area are too tight.  Then I purchased XL. With this the jacket fits better but the arms and shoulder is still tight.  The pants are falling down.  This is unfortunate because its a good value for the money.  Sadly, this will be a return.  Hopefully the seller or Amazon would actually care to read some of these reviews.  Sizing is typical of Asian sellers…..they often get it wrong.  If you can get the size to fit. Great.
