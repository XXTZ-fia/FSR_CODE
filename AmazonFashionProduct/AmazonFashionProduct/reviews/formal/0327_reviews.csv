Very nice heavy fabric, not cheap or flimsy looking. The suit was well made. Runs a little larger as do most expensive suits, however this suit is not expensive at all. The packaging is great. I received several compliments. I purchased two from this company and looking for another one to purchase. Very satisfied customer.",3

Unfortunately, it fit as if Stevie Wonder sewed this suit using combined pattern from 3 different sizes. I understand that the jacket is supposed to have an asymmetrical hem, but the left and right side of the blazer we’re completely different; being especially noticeable in the arm area as one presented with an almost exaggerated shoulder line and the other barely reaching the width of the opposite shoulder. In hopes of at least getting a decent pair of slack out of the deal, I unfolded the pants to find that they were perfectly tailored for someone ten sizes bigger. 😂 The pants would have actually been great if they were my size but they accidentally put a 12 in the bag when I ordered a 2. Overall I wound up returning it, of course, but I’m not completely done with this store either. I’ll take this one as one of those random effups and probably give ‘em another try on a different product later down the line.",21
