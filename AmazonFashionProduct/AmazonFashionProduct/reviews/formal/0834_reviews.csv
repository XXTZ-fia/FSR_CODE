It is very sparkly and has a wonderful twirly skirt. For a sequined dress, this is fairly soft and my daughter said it doesn't feel itchy. The big issue here is that the way this is packaged in a plastic bag really messes up the pleats in the skirt and there is no real way to steam or iron this to get the pleats back in place without ruining the dress.  This unfortunately affects the way the dress hangs and looks. My daughter doesn't care and loves the sparkly purple and the ""twirl factor"" but I don't like the fact that the skirt is off.

I also don't like the sequence on the tie. It makes it difficult to tie it nicely. It also causes the sequence to start falling off. Speaking of falling off, if you plan on having this dress worn more than once I don't foresee this washing well over the long term. I have washed it twice, inside out and hung it up to dry, and there were a lot of sequence left in the washer after the second wash. Not enough to notice any missing on the dress, but given that it was only washed twice, once when it came, and once after being worn, that the sequence have already started to com off.
