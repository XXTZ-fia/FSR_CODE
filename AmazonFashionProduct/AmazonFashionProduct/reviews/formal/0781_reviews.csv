It’s definitely a stylish look, but I can’t justify the price. For over $40, I expected much better quality; the fabric feels really itchy and cheap, and it’s made in China with low-quality materials. If it were priced lower, I'd probably give it a higher rating, but at this price point, it’s just not worth it.  I can't stress how itchy it is. I've never had such an itchy shirt in my life. Washing it will probably help, but the material is already shedding threads and I'm worried it will fall apart if I wash it. Just trying to make it last through one vacation.",

After wearing this linen outfit, however, I've started dabbling more aggressively in linen clothes, mostly pants.  I have to say, I'm really not a huge fan of button-down shorts, but I ended up buying a lot of linen pants after trying these ones on, as COOFANDY makes a pretty wide variety of them, and they're all very comfy. I do like the button-down shirt that comes with these, and the fact that I can leave some of the buttons unbuttoned allows me to maximize comfort, but this outfit ended up pushing me toward v-necks as far as shirts go. I'm definitely pleased with this linen outfit and the other COOFANDY linen pants I bought, though, so I'd suggest checking these out if you want some great clothes to wear on your off days or on vacation.",

It's your favorite Amazon reviewer, Sean 'The Tester' Chao, back again with a new product! Today we're looking at COOFANDY’s Linen Set Outfit. For our test, we used an an adult male with an average/medium figure and average weight.  - Build: This product is well-made. The product is made of a cotton and linen blend. During our inspection, we did not identify any manufacturer defect or design flaw. We note that the product components are put together seamlessly. In our test, we performed a 0.5-pound pull test for 30 seconds and did not notice any deformation or other damage in our post-test analysis. We assess that this product will last 2+ years with regular use, and when handled with care. - Price: At the time of writing, this product is priced comparably to similar products on the market. The clothing niche is a highly saturated market, and we observed comparable products generally at lower and higher price points. However, this product differentiates itself with quality fabric materials, a full outfit (top and bottom), and a unique aesthetic. For these reasons, we consider this a good value. - Function: This product works as intended. In our test, the tester was able to have a full range of motion while wearing the product. The fit of the product was ""perfect,"" according to the tester. Additionally, the feel against the skin was also noted as pleasant, comfortable, and breathable. - Aesthetics: The product looks great – we would argue that it looks better in person than the photos would suggest. Our tester notes that it compliments the body well, while at the same time allowing for full range of motion.  Bottom line: We like this product. It presents a unique aesthetic, is well-made, and is priced competitively. We therefore recommend this to anyone looking for this type of product.  This product earns the 'Sean's Supreme Seal.'  **Seals are rated on this scale** Poor: No Seal Average: 'Sean's Satisfactory Seal' Good: ""Sean's Superior Seal' Excellent: ""Sean's Supreme Seal'",

He would rather not wear matching colors like this but because the shorts are solid and the top has a design to it so he was ok with wearing them together. He has also mixed and matched with other clothes and they still looked great. Great casual look and also can be dressed up. Wear to the beach or out to eat and anything in between. It really does look high end. Great value.,

The shirt is button-up with a collar.  The shorts are fairly long, coming just above the knees.  The shorts have a rear pocket, and two deeper side pockets. The side pockets are deep enough to hold a cell phone.  There is about a 2-inch width of elastic at the waist, with an additional string tie that goes 360° around the waist band. The string tie is removable.  All in all, I really like this set. It allows me to “upgrade” my husband’s wardrobe in a way that gives no “affront” to his manhood by being a matching set.
