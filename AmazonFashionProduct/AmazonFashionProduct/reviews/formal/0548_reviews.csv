A few loose threads, hear and there. Pocket square is sown in (and is a bit crooked, rakish even, but not very “funeral”) and cannot be removed.  Jacket fit like a glove. Vest is a bit too large but is adjustable. Pant wast is “adjustable” as there is elastic in the waste band for some stretch. Pant leg is a smidge too long but not that you’d notice unless you knew what to look for. Overall, for the cost, an absolute steal but it’s not a suit I would expect to last for years.  Make sure to measure yourself before you buy. My measurements had changed so much that I went to Men’s Wearhouse to get updated measurements. It helped a lot when I selected my suit size.",

This helps out so you don’t purchase the wrong size.  Also, I have seen people post reviews that the pockets are sewn shut. If you’ve ever bought a new suit or dress slacks, you've noticed some pockets are sewn. The reason for this is purely aesthetic. You can easily remove the single stitch from the pockets using a thread puller or scissors.  Hope this helps.",3

When it arrived I was pleased with the quality of the fabric and sewing in it… it looked and feels like it would cost more. Then I tried it on. The pants are only describable as skinny. For anyone with more then chicken legs, they will make you feel constricted and on able to sit without your thighs and calves being strangled. The jacket and vest are sport cut…. That’s not the bad part. The sport cut differential is huge in this jacket. My chest is larger then my belly, by a decent “dad bod/ex-regular gym guy” amount but the cut on this jacket made me think I need to wear a corset with the suit. As a guy who has lost weight (yes, I dropped belly weight) this suit made me feel like I hadn’t accomplished anything.",

He's 6' and measured 42. Bought the 42 and 44 but ultimately his size of 42 fit. Would recommend despite the low cost compared typical suits.,

I normally wear a size 46 regular coat, and 40/32 in dress pants. The XXL fits more like a 44 Regular Coat, and the pants are more like 38/32, but they do have some stretch to them so they were comfortable,  but tight around the legs and calves. I am guessing they were made to be slim fit even though the title didnt mention it. Too tight for me to wear and like the appearance.  Quality-wise, it wasn't too bad for the price, I was pleasantly surprised.  The pants were a little thinner than most department store brands as well. The vest was tighter than I would like as well, I can't say how it compared to any other sizing because I don't normally wear a vest, but it was snug. Below is how I estimate size compared to say a suit from Kohl's or JC Penny.Cloudstyle XXL = 44 Regular Coat - 38/32 Pants",2

Pants were very tight and this was classic fit. My son's are black with muscular bodies. They do have muscular thighs and butts.  I bought two suits and I was able to fit the jacket and vest to my younger son but had to purchase slacks to his suit. I am sending the gray suit back. I would have returned the black suit but I didn't have the time. It was more cost conducive to buy slacks for that suit so I will donate the black slacks to my local thrift store. The jacket and  vest fit snug but not to tight. The suit I bought to replace suit was navy blue and cost 186.00. I was trying to prevent such a costly purchase since my boys would have little need for a dress up suit.  They just wear long sleeve shirts khakis and and ties for church.  I measured carefully and bought suits that were recommended for weight and height of my son's.,

I will say the material and question of suit was very nice though. I wish it had fit. Company needs to work on sizing for sure. Also make sure entire 3 pieces of pant suit is sent.
