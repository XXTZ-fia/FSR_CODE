These seams help shape the dress. Even though I’m obese, it actually looks very good on me! (I don’t say that often.)  There are pockets! And they’re deep enough to be useful. Putting my hand in the pocket, the lower seam hits just above my wrist, so maybe 8” deep? Definitely big enough to hold my iPhone.  Size run small but accurate to their listed size guide. I usually wear a size XL top but ordered a 3XL based on their size guide and it fits very well.  The material is not as thin as most of these cheaper dresses on Amazon. 3/4 length sleeves. It is a bit wrinkled out of the package, but I think if I make the effort to fold it carefully, it shouldn’t wrinkle much and I’ll be able to travel with this dress.  I’m off now to buy more colors. I bought the deep sky blue and love that color.",6

I got this dress to wear to a funeral. Now sadly I've worn it to 3. I've worn it with sandals and boots. It's comfortable and flattering. The material isn't too thin. It isn't that awful shiny material some are made of. And has just the right amount of stretch. Wrinkles come out with a quick toss in the dryer for a few minutes. It's a great little dress. I might buy it in more colors but I don't wear dresses much. I actually have two sizes in black. I bought the XL and wore it once and felt it was a little big. So I got the L and felt it fit better. That says a lot about liking the dress.",14

You never know with these things. So, it you order one, get the size you usually wear.  It will probably shrink a bit, so I might have it dry cleaned.  It's so handy to have a ""little black dress.""Hope you don't have troubles with the seller, as I did.  I ordered way ahead of time because, if you really need something, there will usually be a problem.  I received an email telling me when it would arrive.  Then I received an email telling me it would arrive a few days late.  I received another email on that date telling me it would be a bit later.  Nice apologies.  On the next due date I get an email telling me that I HAD CANCELED THE ORDER.  I don't think so.  I never even answered their late notices!  With less than 1 week to go, I wrote them an all caps letter telling them I had most certainly NOT canceled the order and I had !#%$& well better get it asap.  The dress came a few days later!
