The cuffs are a nice thick material with good elasticity too.  The material/fabric has a nice ""worn in"" feel to it, not super soft, but not rigid either. The color I ordered (Grey) had a nice fade to it, which is consistent throughout the sweatshirt.  I ordered a XX-Large, it does not seem to be oversized, I personally would describe it as true to size. Perhaps it is wider in some areas around the waist, but in my opinion the XX-Large seems to be true to size.  The sweatshirt did shrink a little bit after its first wash, but that is to be expected from 100% cotton clothing.  TL;DR Comfortable sweatshirt that I wear all the time, definitely recommended!",

Pros:  Comfortable Fit: The oversized design is incredibly comfortable and perfect for lounging or casual outings. It feels relaxed without being shapeless.  Stylish Aesthetic: The vintage look adds a unique flair that sets it apart from standard hoodies, making it easy to pair with jeans or joggers.  Soft Fabric: The material is soft and cozy, providing warmth without being too heavy. It’s great for layering during colder months.  Durability: The quality of the fabric is impressive, holding up well after multiple washes without losing shape or color.  Cons:  Sizing Variability: The oversized fit can vary between styles, so it’s good to check the size guide to ensure you get the right fit.  Limited Color Options: Some designs have a limited color palette, which may not appeal to everyone’s taste.  Overall, these men's vintage oversized hoodies are a fantastic addition for anyone looking to blend comfort with style. They offer a relaxed vibe that’s perfect for everyday wear. Highly recommended!",

Once it was freed from it's bag I waited for it to ""explode"" into shape because it's advertised as ""heavyweight"", and it was heavy. No explosion. It did expand, but the material is not as thick as I pictured, being 100% cotton, and ""heavyweight"". Thing is....this hoodie IS heavyweight, and soft, and one of the most comfortable hoodies I've ever worn ! And I wear a LOT of hoodies. The material is deceiving, because it's rather thin in your hand, but it's nice, and heavy when you hold it, and feels incredible wearing it. I have hoodies 1/2"" thick that aren't as warm and cozy as this one. It has a fleece-like lining inside which may be the reason it's so thick, and warm. The beauty doesn't end there though. The ""acid wash"" on this hoodie is pretty awesome, and it looks like I've been wearing it for the last 10 years. I got the gray color and it has the perfect ""worn hoodie"" look, like that old one you just can't part with. I will never part with this one. It is over sized which means plenty of room, though it's true to size and my usual XL fit me perfectly. It has a good size ""kangaroo pocket"" in front that can hold quite a bit. This hoodie is outstanding, and if I could give it 10 stars, I would ! Take it from a hoodie addict.....this is great stuff !! HIGHLY recommend !!",

This bleeds a lot of color in the wash and you can expect a load of pink clothes if you don’t be careful. It’s still bleeding after several washes so be careful.
