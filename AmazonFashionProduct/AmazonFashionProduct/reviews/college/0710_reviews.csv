Sindy Funakoshi,VERY SPACIOUS/ USED AS DIAPER BAG,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EQ5UHIMY4EVZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C5HGNFB1,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 4, 2024",Color: Black & BrownSize: 15.6 Inch,Verified Purchase,"My husband and I love, love, love this bag! We use is as a diaper bag and intend to also use it as a travel bag next year and it is perfect. it has plenty of pockets for anything. We carry snacks, water bottles, drink cups for the baby, diapers, wipes, extra clothes for us and the baby, bibs, etc and it all fits perfectly and we still have plenty of room left in it. I love the tiny back pocket for my wallet and keys. Material is thick, does not feel cheap at all. My husbands loves that the zipper hooks to itself for extra protection. Such a good buy... We are still on the hunt for a second travel bag so myself and Im considering getting the cream colored one. :) Can't go wrong.",

Michelle Dupray,Best pre-trip purchase!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14QGJLQIBPW0G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C5HGNFB1,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 9, 2024",Color: Beige & CoffeeSize: 15.6 Inch,Verified Purchase,"I never write reviews, but here I am! Let me start off by saying this bag is not for one looking for something sleek and small. This backpack is a monster in the absolute best way possible - I called it the Monster Backpack for a reason. I took it on a trip to Japan for two weeks and it was easily one of the best pre-trip purchases I made. There’s five very spacious pockets - to give an idea, when I carried it on to the plane, I had a rain jacket, regular jacket, Nintendo switch, my Kindle (great purchase especially for travel, 10/10 recommend for readers), over the ear headphones in their huge case, a couple pairs of earbuds, a makeup bag and a container for makeup brushes, Owala water bottle, wet wipes, a first aid kit, and many, many other things. And it fit under the airplane seat no problem! I obviously took out some of the heavier stuff for walking around days, leaving in the important things like first aid kid, rain jacket, and umbrella and fan I acquired while I was there. But this bag never budged. The seams never gave out, the zippers never complained, I was continually putting more and more into it like a true Mary Poppins bag with no issues at all. I loved the port on the outside to allow you to plug your phone into a power bank, too. I bought three foot cables and had occasional moments where the cord would disconnect from the bag, but that’s my fault for not getting the appropriate length cable. While the bag can get large, it remains easy to carry and was a sturdy, steadfast travel companion. I recommend it fully and I’m so happy with the purchase I made!!",

Ever. It's so pretty, comfortable to carry, a good price, and good quality, I can use it for school or travel, and there are so many pockets!! It has three main sections for easy organization (I can fit anything inside) and the anti-theft pocket is very useful too. The water bottle pockets are stretchy so it can hold a large water bottle. It also has a place to put a power bank. My only concern is that it will get dirty/stained over time, but it looks like it would wipe clean. I would definitely buy from loveook again.",
