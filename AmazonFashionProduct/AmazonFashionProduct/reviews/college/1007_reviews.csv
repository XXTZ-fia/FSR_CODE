I'm 6'1 and I usually order an XL so I went ahead and ordered a size up. It fits, but it's a pretty snug fit which I know some people might like, and if you're that person go ahead and size up once. I on the other hand personally prefer my jackets to be a bit more on the loose end, and if you're the same way then I'd advice going 2 sizes up. Other than that, great product and I absolutely recommend it to any Hotline Miami fan!",

Sales tax sent it above $80. I was pretty worried, especially since buying these generic-brand clothes on Amazon tends to be a risky gamble. I can sum it up here, though: *get this one.* I saw a few reviews saying the sleeves were itchy, but there's sleek fabric inside the sleeves that prevent any itchiness. It's thick and warm, and the stitching is nice and durable. The buttons are sturdy, I couldn't find any loose threads, and there are interior pockets! I got extra large since it was the same price and I love oversized clothing. I'm 5'2"", and I'm swimming in it. Goes great with a rooster mask.",

For one, the jackets sleeves are wildly itchy: I washed it pretty much as soon as I got it to see if it would make the sleeves more comfortable but it didn't change it at all. The other problem is the buttons are quite weak and tend to snap in two, this is easily fixable by simply pushing them back together, but it is likely to occur more than once so I suggest keeping an eye out for pieces of button until you fix it permanently with some sort of extra strength glue. Despite these issues, I would heavily recommend this jacket, especially for fans of hotline miami.",4
