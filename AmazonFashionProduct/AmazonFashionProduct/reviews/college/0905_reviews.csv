BeachGirl710,Very cute and a great size.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1144NPBBIGA5Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ6PQ7F2,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2025",Color: Black,,"This backpack purse is very nice and I was definitely impressed by the quality. The bag itself has a textured coloring to it to provide visual interest and is sleek enough to match almost any outfit.  The seams and stitching feels very durable and I have not had any issues with the bag after using it daily for a month. There are plenty of compartments making it able to hold all your daily necessities, a few extra items, and even a couple books for whatever the day holds.  The bottle holders on the sides are large enough to hold the chunkier water bottles, but the slender bottles fit more comfortably. They are also not elastic, so you won't have to worry about the bottle holders getting stretched out over time and becoming unusable.  The removable buckle strap is a nice idea, but the functionality of it is a bit odd, so I can't imagine many getting use out of it. If you are wanting a backpack purse, this is nice, but not as a shoulder bag.  The only complaint I have about the bag is that the straps are not padded and are rather thin, so if you overload the bag, the straps dig into your shoulders. But considering this is intended to be a purse, overloading shouldn't be a common issue. If you are thinking about this for school though, you might want to look for a padded strap bag.",

Honestly Speaking,Exceptionally well-made – total quality. I’m very impressed!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34JBCAM45CU8C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ6PQ7F2,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Color: Black,,"I would say this is a mix between a big, beautiful, classy purse, lined and everything, and a small, functional, handy backpack. The best of both worlds! It has pockets galore and many ways to organize your items within. There is even a padded section in the back to protect a laptop or tablet.  The creamy satin lining (reminiscent of an expensive purse) is soft and gorgeous and also makes it easy to see and find things inside. I can carry it by the short handle, or a longer adjustable strap over one shoulder, or wear it like a backpack on my back. The backpack shoulder straps are not padded like a traditional backpack, so I wouldn’t wear it that way for a long time, but at least I have that option when I want to go hands-free.  It's an exceptionally well-made backpack with thick, sturdy, waterproof PU Leather that really looks and feels like a nice distressed leather. Incredible quality. The zippers are sturdy and all of the hooks and other design elements are all in silver, which dresses it up with a super classy look. I’m just totally impressed with this product! It would make a lovely statement if given as a gift, as well!",

I seen this bag and thought about using it for my laptop but once I got it in and realized just how nice it was, I switched everything out for this to be my diaper bag/purse.  It’s not too big but not small, and it’s not bulky at all… There is even a zipper pocket on the back to hide personal items. It fits my wallet and cell phone… I love that it has a ton of seperate hidden compartments along with pockets. It’s not the type of pockets that are so big that they mix halfway into the middle of the bag, so all you really see is a pile of pockets that you’re digging through.  This is definitely well made, as well as the zippers. There is padding and it doesn’t hurt when I carry it like a bookbag or on my shoulder for a bag. It’s functional and highly durable. I love the material as it looks super professional, elegant, it’s so versatile that it can be used for any occasion. I highly recommend this bag and when an if it ever breaks, I will be ordering another to use although I don’t foresee that happening.",

I love all the pockets, I still used an insert but I’m glad I have the extra compartments. The straps have been comfortable so far and most importantly for me- they don’t move! No uncomfortable sliding of straps or where they come undone and loosen. Also, the material is lovely and smooth to the touch. Love this backpack, it’s roomy and sleek looking.

Crystal,Finally Found the Perfect Backpack Purse!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37FJ6G232ALM9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ6PQ7F2,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: Black,,"I’m so happy I found this! I prefer a backpack-style purse, and it’s taken me ages to find one I truly like. The suede-like material has a subtle, stone-washed look that I wasn’t sure about online, but I’m so glad I gave it a chance—it’s perfect.  This bag has more pockets and compartments than my previous favorite backpack purse, making it so much more functional. It also comes with a long strap, but I probably won’t use it since I prefer carrying it by one of the backpack straps. What really sets this bag apart is the design of the straps: the front matches the suede-like material, but the back side is nylon with a bit of grip. This keeps it from sliding off my shoulder as most do—such a thoughtful touch!  The interior is a tan color, which makes it easier to see what’s inside, though I wish it were made with a prettier material. The straps are thicker than most backpack purses, and the bag itself is slightly larger than the average. It’s somewhere between a purse and a regular backpack in size—big enough to fit an iPad, lunch, drink, phone, wallet, and more, without feeling awkwardly oversized.  Style-wise, it leans casual but still works for dressing up, like a dinner date or an event. Another unexpected bonus: it smells good! I think they treated it to avoid the usual manufacturing odors, which don’t bother me much, but it’s a nice surprise.  Overall, it feels rugged and well-made, and I can see it lasting for years. With its thoughtful design and practicality, this might just be my new favorite bag!",

Right out of the box, I noticed the quality of material, it feels like a luxurious mix of suede and leather. It's a nice weight too, feels well made, and not too heavy. I've never been a backpack person, but this one may just change me. It's the perfect size – not too big or too small – with ample pockets to keep everything organized. I can fit my wallet, phone, keys, makeup, and even a small tablet with room to spare. Even my husband, who's Mr. Backpack America, was impressed! He loved the look and feel of it and commented on the material and roominess. 😉 Highly recommend this to anyone looking for stylish and functional, likes everything in their purse to have a place, and likes extra room for those day to day 'extras' you may need to carry.",

In the main large compartment there is a zipper pocket and then a couple of open organizer pockets. on the front there is a snap enclosure which could easily carry a phone. There are 2 additional zipper pockets on the front with the lower one having an additional clip ring that you could attach your keys to. Its the perfect  go to bag for school/work when you need to carry a small laptop. It does have a removeable shoulder strap as well if you do not wish to carry it as a backpack and it has a handle on top to be able to quickly grab it. The only real negative (which is why I took a star off) are the width of the straps. Being around 1 1/4 "" wide I would think that they would start to dig into your shoulders if you loaded down the backpack and had to carry it any great distance.  It's a really nice bag if you are carrying it short distances or if you are keeping it light.",

PU Leather fades, cracks, chips, and scratches rather easily so this bag is not made to last. Its too small and poorly compartmentalized to be a decent backpack. Its too big to be a usable purse. Having this hang on your side or as a cross bag is just too bulky and feels weird. The outside pocket flap on the back has a magnetic clasp.

For all your needs like a hair comb A brush 2 pockets on the outside for water bottles. The front has pockets for your phone or an iPad/tablet, it's nicely lined inside with a copper colored silkish lining. It stands up on its own. It's not what I was expecting. It's way better than anticipated. It's extremely detailed. It feels like canvas a soft leather feel & that's what it says it's made from.  The zippers are well made. They have some kind of heavy duty bottom where it stands up on its own. It's not heavy bag. It's lightweight, so you can throw it over your shoulder. Or you can carry it like a backpack. It's probably about the size of a bit bigger than a 70 page notebook. Perfect size purse. I definitely recommend it.  One of the nicest things i've purchased in a while!
