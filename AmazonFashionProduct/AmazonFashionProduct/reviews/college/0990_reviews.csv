Compression Socks,Short on compartments,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UBR28MYPQTMV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4152SK4,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Color: Dark Brown Leather Travel Laptop Backpack,Verified Purchase,"Solid backpack that easily handles my laptop, tablet and accessories with plenty room left over for anything ekse. It would get 5 for durability, looks, quality of zrppers and seams and quality of leather.  It lacks multiple compartments inside the main bag.  It has an open pouch for laptop or tablet plus 2 side by side much smaller pouches on the opposite side that don't serve much purpose since they are open and whatever you put in there will be out onto the large body of the bag. There are 3 covered pouches on the outside, a half size pouch in front with magnetics snaps that is suitable for a phone and wallet and 2 small pouches on either side with magnetic snaps.  I don't think you can go wrong with this large backpack it does everything advertised though I found it to be short on compartments.  It's definitely a good value for the money.",

Arnold C.,"It's okay. Fake leather, hidden in the product description.

It has the distinct PU look, which isn't necessarily bad, but you have to be okay with a shiny black. The material feels thin, but all of the zippers work fine and it's roomy inside.",

It looks looks nice, it is big and zippers are sturdy! The quality of the inside is what you expect from a laptop back pack and the best part of it, it is that it doesn't have any huge logos or anything. I have added a patch to it and man it just blends into it perfectly !  Gorgeous Items, i will 100% get this item once again !  The back is definitely not made from real leather for sure, it is made from the fake one, strap are thin and they dont feel string but they have been holding on very well, no issue as of Now :D",

Has a dark, rich chocolate color and looks like real leather, but is on the thinner side. It also turned out to be a bit smaller than I was expecting (about medium sized) but still fairly spacious.  Lots of pockets on the inside and outside of the bag. The main compartment zips up top, as well as snaps close in the front. The snaps are pretty secure— they actually stay closed once you snap them in place. The padded straps make it comfortable to carry.  All in all, very satisfied with the look and performance of this bag.",

It's smooth to the touch. Size-wise, it can fit a small laptop, up to 15 inches. The belt-strap style also gives it a nice, rugged and vintage look to it. The outer edges of the backpack straps have these dark brown outlines, giving the straps a cool and stylish look. Zippers work smoothly thus far. I love the overall design and color.",

It's not too big yet small enough that you can carry it on a plane and put it under the seat in front of you.  It has plenty of room on the inside to hold your purse, make up bag, and other things you might want to carry rather than pack in your suitcase.  There are the attached straps to carry it over your back plus an extra strap that will allow you to carry it like a purse.  I like the denim-like color and I feel it's reasonably priced and good quality.",
