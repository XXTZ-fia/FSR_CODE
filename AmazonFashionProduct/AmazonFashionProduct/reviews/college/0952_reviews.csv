It has an adjustable string, but it can only be adjusted to make it smaller and not to expand the waistband bigger. My weight tends to fluctuate 5lbs and it is still too tight even when I'm closer to 130lbs rather than 135lbs. Also, the material is pilling on both top and bottoms, and I've only had these pajamas for about 60 days. I regret buying these pajamas and don't recommend them.",

Perfect for summer. The pockets are deeper than I expected too which is great and my phone doesn’t fall out of them. The waist band has the perfect amount of elasticity and the strings are thick and stay tied but aren’t bulky if you just leave them hanging.  The shirt could be better though. It’s smaller than expected and doesn’t seem to match the quality of the pants. It’s thin and shows everything. I’m not sure if it’s because of my larger chest but the shirt is definitely snug. The sleeves don’t stretch out very much either. I’ll likely wear the pants with a different top or add a hoodie when wearing the top.  The color is nice though and it washes well. I didn’t put either in the dryer and just hung them up to dry. They dried quickly.,10
