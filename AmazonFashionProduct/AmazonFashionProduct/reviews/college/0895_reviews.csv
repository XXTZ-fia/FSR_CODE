It's thin and a bit oversized, so looks good over various tops, but I have a couple of other shackets and the material of this one is nowhere near similar. I do love it and wear it often, but want to make it clear for others that may be looking for something on the thicker side.",
Amy Hart,Not “shacket” material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16N09GE46EU3Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCBMBKM6,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 9, 2024",Color: Dark PurpleSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"It’s soft and comfortable but bought to wear as a shacket style top over other shirts and it’s thinner than expected.

Color is same as shown in the picture, same design. But it is way too big. I understand it has a loose fitting, but loose doesn't mean BIG. I had to give it to my aunt and she uses M/L, and even to her it had a loose fit. But fabric is soft, feels good to the skin. Style is chic and casual. Good for fall... Washed it in cold water and delicate and came out alright. No loose strings, or anything similar. My aunt likes it, and don't get me wrong, i do too, but i just think this is not the right sizing.",

Very soft fabric but easy to snag. I wouldn't say this sweater is the most flattering but it is so comfortable that I still find myself reaching for it. The only thing that drives me nuts is that the collar keeps flopping inward and I constantly need to fix it. Other than the collar this is a nice lightweight, casual, and very soft sweater. I love the soft color and texture. Nice item but know it is supposed to be oversized.",2
