Era un regalo para mi novia y le encantó. (Los colores son más vivos que en las fotos y video) Es una maleta grande, a tener en cuenta, se ve pequeña, pero es de gran capacidad.  Tiene muchos espacios y bolsillos, adicional que viene con un cable para cargar el teléfono, por supuesto que hay que comprar un power bank, pero es una opción versátil.  Recomiendo esta maleta, tiene buena capacidad y sus materiales son de excelente calidad, muy gruesa. 👍🏼",5

I was able to condense a work out bag, a heavy laptop bag and a lunch bag into this one backpack! I admit it’s large once packed but it’s better than carrying several bags and being bogged down and disorganized. Once on, it is comfortable with great weight distribution with the straps. Highly recommended for the price and quality.",5
