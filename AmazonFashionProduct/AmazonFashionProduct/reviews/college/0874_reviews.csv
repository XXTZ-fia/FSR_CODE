Anonymous,"A classic, easy fit college logo shirt",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2771JVCEH2I66/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKYYG4SS,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 26, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Washington Huskies - Fall Heather,,"The university logos on these shirts are literally old school and as classic as they come. The shirt has a lot of ease in the fit for women, likely because it is unisex. The fabric is soft and light-to-midweight. I chose my alma mater, but I like the classic logos so much I think I'll get a couple more for some of the lesser known schools with clever mascots.",
Gcat,"Nice fabric, accurate design",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OF4WW1VBRKL8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKYYG4SS,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Michigan Wolverines - Fall Heather,,I have the Michigan version and the maize and blue colors are accurate along with the block M logo. The fabric is very soft with the nice cotton/poly blend. Sizing is accurate.  The heathered appearance is more pronounced in real life compared to the picture. Not a bad thing as the heathered variations look good.,
