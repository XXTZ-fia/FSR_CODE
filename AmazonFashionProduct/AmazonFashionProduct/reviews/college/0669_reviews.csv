I have been able to leave my litigation bag behind (heavy to carry up and down subway steps due to the wheels). I have had it for 13 months and use it EVERY DAY because I carry it daily as a handbag (pocketbook)!! It is still going STRONG and im back today to buy 2 more - a different color for myself and one for my sister who hasn't found a good bag to carry around her 3-years-old's and her stuff. I bought the Black & white bag. I got a similar-looking one from Temu first, but on Day 1, my pens were dropping out from the bottom of the side pocket as I walked, due to thin material and stitching.  Note: The look when carrying it is not squared out, but bulges according to what you have in it. Also, it will droop when carrying it on your shoulder full and heavy, because the only long straps for that are the backpack straps, so either use it fully as a backpack or manage it lopsided toting it around with one backpack strap. You have choices and even one strap is sturdy enough for the whole bag. BUY IT!!",

I didn't expect the bag to last years but I did expect it to last more than a couple of months. I'm really disappointed because this bag has a lot of great features and is very attractive and comfortable, but the fabric is just subpar.

This backpack fits her 16"" LG Gram laptop perfectly, with room for plenty of books and supplies. She loves all the pockets and the appearance of the backpack. The stitching is fine with my defects anywhere. She's very happy with it so far. I'll try to update this review in 6 months after she's put some wear and tear on the backpack.",
