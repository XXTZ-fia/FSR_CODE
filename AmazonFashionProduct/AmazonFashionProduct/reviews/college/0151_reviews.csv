I wanted a more snug fit, the jacket is fine for what your buying, good quality dupe but for the most part looks good. Could be warm with additional sweater depending on weather, the fit was where i wanted it to be, and the color and overall detail is a close enough match to the original.",

The elastic/ stretchy parts on the cuffs and bottom are pretty thick and feel quality. The leather isnt the highest quality or super thick but looks fine and isnt super noticeable. The bones and B are on there pretty good and feel kinda cheap but for the price it isnt bad at all. It was kinda tight when buttoned up but im fat so if your belly isnt too big you'll be fine. I would suggest going up a size bigger than usual though.,6

The rivets that the buttons clasp on to were falling out of the collar and bottom hem of the jacket. The sleeves are made of a pleather material and the body is a felt like material that wind cuts right through yet it says 100% polyester..... someone mentioned they got something similar off of sheen for much cheaper and I believe it, you can buy jewelry for literally pennies. Some products made in China are completely fine, some are great, these seem more like dressed up industrial leftovers (or waste if you prefer) that are smelly and horrible quality but, they look nice I guess.",
