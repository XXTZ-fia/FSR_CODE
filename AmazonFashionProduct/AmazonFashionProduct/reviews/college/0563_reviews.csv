Jordan,Good except for the zipper,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OFCDJ088WX1I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C65LMZFW,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 31, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Does a good just holding your things well and looking aesthetic. However, the zipper gets stuck on itself all the time and it’s super annoying to fix. The zipper itself is good quality metal but it zips on the insisted of the bag entirely too much. You have to be pretty cautious about that everytime you zip and unzip. Other than that it’s a good, durable product.",
