Alicia S,"Beautiful dress, but not for large busts",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PUZ32WG1TYBP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRZ96S14,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Pink Floral,,"I got this dress to wear as a guest to a spring, floral wedding. First off, the pattern is even more beautiful in person, and the quality is surprisingly good. I reaaaally wanted it to work! Unfortunately, the bust is sewn in a way that is not flattering for large busts. For reference, I’m a 32F bra size, and got a small. I will try a larger size to see if that helps the fit. I love the feel of the material, although it doesn’t stretch. It’s definitely worth the price. I love the flow of it, and it would be perfect for the occasion, or just to wear out and about.",

Visi,"Ohhhh, I LOVE This Dress!!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1V79ONQZHPEUW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRZ96S14,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",,,"I am so glad I bought this dress!  Belle Poque is one of my favorite clothing brands and I own a variety of their garments from blouses to skirts, belts, cardigans, and all different types of dresses.  When I saw the great price on this one ($16.99) and the beautiful colors and pattern, I HAD to get it. After the promotions offered and a discount I had, I spent $9.20 on this dress and its worth every single penny. Its worth the $16.99 and more, honestly.  There were no weird smells when I opened the package and the garment itself doesnt have any negative odors.  The material is so soft and light and flowy and its COMFORTABLE.  I can see myself wearing this with a cardigan in cooler weather and I think it will be perfect as-is in warm weather too.  The style of this dress is very complimentary for my figure. Its cut in a way that hides my loose abdominal and stomach skin, which I LOVE.  It hits me at a nice place on my calf (below knee) that doesnt make my legs look bigger than they are. (hard for me to find!)  There is a nice stretchy smocked area between the shoulder blades in back that helps lend a bit of give to the garment. This helps when putting it on and taking it off. (relieves stress on the garment)  This company sells true to size, American sized clothes and this dress is no different.  I haven't washed it yet bc it just arrived today but I will be washing it on cold delicate cycle in a delicates bag and then hang to air dry, followed by a light ironing. I believe that will help extend the life of the dress, but it seems to be very well made. A quality garment from the seams to the stitches and everything in between.  Nothing hangs wrong or looks funky on this dress. Nothing bulges weird.  My ONLY issue with this dress is the two vertical ruffles in front. I wish the company had chosen to use material with print on both sides, instead of using material that only had the pattern printed on one side.  If the ruffles werent the way they are, Id have given this dress an easy 5 stars. Because of them cutting corners with single sided ruffle print, I docked a star.  I cant wait til I have a place to wear this lovely dress!  FYI: I am 5ft3, 36D, 157 pounds and shortwaisted with 28 inch inseam.",

The way this dress is made it has the outline for your breats, so if your breats do not fit in it, the dress does not fit you. There is hardly any give or stretch to the dress as well, so Im basically out of luck. I wish they could make a dress just like this, but big chest friendly.",

The material is so soft and the waist looks small but its super stretchy so it’s really flattering on you. The zipper is actually on the side, I honestly love that because it makes it a lot easier to take on and off, it’s also more discrete. The ruffles along the dress look amazing, they blend so well! Amazing quality overall, the dress is very comfortable. I will say though it didn’t come with pockets which I thought it said somewhere in the description it would, but the dress is still great. Another thing is I’m a 36DD so the chest underlining was a bit off, but not super noticeable so I don’t mind it. Material thickness is perfect in my opinion, perfectly thick so that it’s not see-through at all but not TOO thick that it makes you sweat just standing in it. Worth buying!",3

The green is a beautiful sage color that I feel like would compliment any skin tone. The ruffles are so fun and not too much that it's awkward. I wish there was a bit more support in the chest area, but the straps are adjustable which is a bit plus on these kinds of dresses. It was an outdoor wedding in August so it was a bit warm out but this dress was relatively breathable so I was never uncomfortable in it. Definitely recommend for a nice date night, a walk on the town, or a summer wedding.",

I got my usual Belle Poque size of XXL and it's a little snug on my size 18/20 body, but it the elastic stretch material on the back allows me to adjust and fit it. It also has adjustable straps which help immensely. Once I got everything all adjusted and situation, I was so happy with what I saw in the mirror!  The dress is very flattering on most every figure - the way it hangs (not clings) and flows is so beautiful, like a flower swaying in the wind. I was at first skeptical about the ruffles down the sides but once it's on, they offer a beautiful silhouette and movement that makes you look like a soft Spring breeze. It's a very graceful and classy dress while still being young, fresh and flirty.  I got the green color and it reminds me so much of Spring and summer. There is a light lining on the inside that prevents the dress from being see-through. Despite the polyester, this dress was thoughtfully crafted and it shows in how it wears. It's beautiful and i'm very happy with this dress.",7

The bust is too high, made for perky tits that have never breastfed. The fabric has no give or stretch in it, so I could barely zip it up around my postpartum belly and nursing breasts. There are adjustable straps, but they don't adjust long enough for me. I had to wear a strapless, push-up bra to get my boobs to fit right in the dress. Even then, it is not a perfect fit. I am 125 lbs, 5'4"" and 2 months postpartum, and I ordered small. I wish I ordered medium. I hope this dress fits me better as I lose more baby weight and stop nursing.

When she got it on, it was just breathtaking. I was a little iffy on how the side pieces would look in real life, but they absolutely belong on the dress. The pattern is stunning- it’s definitely got an older world feel to it. The cut of the bust is a little weird- I do suggest wearing a strapless that shapes you the way you want to be shaped, my daughter did this and it made all the difference in the world.  The material is so flowy and twirlable, and you’re not going to be able to resist spinning in it! It’s the perfect length. Paired with some navy heeled sandals and her pearls, this dress literally made her boyfriend of several years gasp- along with everyone else. It’s so delightfully lovely. I would love to have it in my size!  This dress is so beautiful and anyone lucky enough to see you in it will absolutely be glad they did.

It looks and fits beautifully! It's my second dress from this seller and I must say that, although I am not a big fan of the fabrics, the designs are fabulous and the fit is always spot on. As I zipped this particular dress, it really felt like it was tailored just for me. It's absolutely perfect fit-wise and I am sure that the thin, but double layer fabric, and the elastic in the back will give many ladies this same feeling. For reference, I am 5'5, 130 lbs and got an S. In terms of the fabric, it does feel like polyester and not even the type that tries to imitate a cotton blend. However, it is very soft and it has zero static issues, which surprised me and it's definitely a plus. In fact, I believe that it's because of this fabric that the dress falls/flows so beautifully. I chose the white with blue flowers pattern because it makes the dress look a bit more casual and I'll get to wear it more often. Happy with my choice, as I'm really excited to wear this dress as soon as it gets warm! :) I definitely recommend it; I think the price is excellent for a dress that is as beautiful and flattering as this.",9
