However i wish for it to be a little larger. it did fit all my items but that was it no extra room couldn't add anything to it. I also wish the straps were a little longer because after carrying it around for a while one side of the strap came off. It was easily fix and went about my day. overall i did like using this backpack for what i needed to use it for.,
Sammy,Good back pack with lots of room,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HAT8EYKB4IPA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BYYM4X9G,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 11, 2023",Color: Blue,,"The cables for the headphone and USB port are removable, making it easy to wash. it has lots of room and nice internal pockets. Mine is mounted to the tail seat on my motorcycle where it gets riding gear, pop bottles, and stuff from the store absolutely rammed into it. I have had to sit on it before to get it to close with all the stuff I put in there. that said, the seams/zippers/webbing are all holding up excellent. I am able to fit a small luggage lock through the zippers (theft deterrent). overall this bag is holding up very well for the abuse I'm putting it through.",
G. THOMAS,"Pretty good vacation backpack, fits a lot of stuff and pockets are useful",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35KLLGA7HAJM3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BYYM4X9G,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 9, 2023",Color: Blue,,"We just went on a 8 day vacation and I tried out this new backpack. There are lots of useful pockets for things; I'll admit I didn't use all the features (like the charging port), but overall I was impressed with how much it held and kept things organized. For those of you with teens that use Jansport backpacks for school and traveling, you know what I'm talking about.  This isn't just a bottomless pit one-compartment backpack. There are carefully thought out slots for things inside:  -Padded flat area for your laptop (keep in mind that 14"" is prob the max size laptop you'd want to bring) -One more flat slot for paperwork and folders (handy for travel documents) -Zipper interior pockets, one of which we used to hide passports securely -Smaller pockets for pens, and other easy-to-lose items -Extra ""open area"" room for a rolled up jacket or sweatshirt  On the outside, you have some nice features as well including:  -Standard outer pouch zippered pocket where you can put things for easy reach like hand sanitizer and pens -An open flap pocket with magnetic button closure to put things like a cell phone that you want to keep taking in and out of your bag during flight -Water bottle holder (smaller is better, maybe 20 oz max bottle that isn't too tall)  I also appreciated and liked the top handles when you want to carry the backpack with your hands instead of on your back. That part was one of my favorite features. The handles are well made and strong, not like the nylon loop that most school backpacks come with.  As far as the cons, I am taking away 1 star just because it CAN be a little uncomfortable on a long day out. We had a half day of walking around Seattle, each one of us with a backpack on. Walking around with a full backpack showed that the backpack straps and overall comfort were not designed for this kind of use. Hiking backpacks and sport backpacks have curved straps for better fit over your shoulders and back. This backpack just has straight straps from top to bottom. It eventually caught up to me and was not comfortable. Again, this is after walking around for 30 minutes with a fairly heavy load. Normally we wouldn't be doing this kind of walking with backpacks on, but we had 6 hours to kill after a cruise and had already checked our luggage with the airline.  Finally, I wasn't thrilled with the gold hardware on the baby blue color, but I think it did make it a little unique since you don't see that every day. All the hardware is in the gold so it's a little overwhelming when you first look at it. I would have preferred brushed stainless steel or graphite gray hardware on the baby blue backpack.",
Flippin' RV,Not really made for carrying laptop plus several travel items,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FTIP8K9N3YDF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BYYM4X9G,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 6, 2023",,,"Looks -  It’s not unattractive but it is really more for people looking for a functional backpack than its looks.  The gold zippers give it a little more elegant look but that’s about as far as attractiveness as I see it.Functionality - There truly is a lot going on with this backpack. The front compartment has an interior open pocket and a built-in retractable keychain.  That is a great design.  As for the side pockets - one side is for large water bottle while the other side it’s designed to place a small tissue box in or napkins that has an opening for easy access. There’s also access to USB and headphone jacks on left side of backpack, which is a good design but are not for fast charging and most people now do bluetooth phone connection.  The main compartment also has many inside pockets and 1 with mesh pocket with zipper.  The back compartment also has enough pocket to put in a laptop and large tablet.  The padding, however, seems to be pretty thin, especially on the bottom and in between the laptop and tablet.  The straps are also fairly thin and not well padded.  Realistically, the bag itself is already fairly hefty.  When the backpack is fully loaded with a lightweight plastic water bottle that is half full, a laptop, laptop power adapter, a set of clothes and some toiletries, the bag is super heavy; but the most concerning part is if it will hold up in the long haul.  I think it might be better off to be used as a light carry backpack without heavy electronics around town instead of a travel backpack as I had hoped.Overall - 3/5 stars; if there was more padding on the bottom and had better support in key areas, it would have a higher rating.",

Almost like there had been a sticker on a few different places. I’m still trying to get the stickiness off. The straps are nicely padded and comfortable. The backpack came with the cords to connect an extra charging bank and also headphones from inside the bag to the connection outside the bag.

There are dedicated pouches for a laptop and a tablet, as well as a completely separate pocket large enough to carry several thick textbooks. This layout makes this bag perfect for a college student.  We picked this bag up for our daughter who is a new college student, and expect it will hold up very well to the abuse that students can dish out.  The pass-through feature of a USB plug and a microphone jack means she can keep a small power bank in the laptop to be able to easily charge her phone on the go.

eventer,Capacious and well-made  grown-up backpack,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32NC3FNB6YB2M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BYYM4X9G,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 20, 2023",,,"This pack will find a multitude of uses. It's very well-made with all-metal hardware and strong stitching. It's stylish, lined throughout with a nifty striped fabric. The contrasting gold-colored hardware adds a glamorous touch. It has many pockets; I will probably lose things in it there are so many, but there's a place for everything. The straps are decently padded. The ""beige"" fabric is really a cream color but is slick enough that most soil will likely wipe away easily. I hove the fact that it has (sturdy!) top carry handles and a webbing band on the back so that it can be slid over the handle of your rolling suitcase. I find the ""napkin"" (probably tissue) pocket to be a useless affectation, but others might find it useful. The water bottle pocket will fit taller and slimmer bottles but not the common wider bottles; I'd estimate 3-3.5"" as its maximum diameter.  Still, a very well-made and useful pack that is more grown-up and elegant than an ordinary backpack.",

I was looking for something a bit less “utilitarian” than the normal backpack I use on a daily basis. During the winter I work in a mountain resort ED/Urgent Care facility. I used a regular Burton backpack for that because it gets placed on the ground under the registration des and often encounters mud, ice, water, and sometimes even bodily fluids. Now that I’m working in a family practice setting I didn’t need something as tough. I wanted something classier and more suited for a professional office setting. Yes, I’m a bit worried about the color and the bag getting dirty. But I let my dog paw it after going on a walk on mountain trails. I used a baby wipe and the dirt came off easily and you can’t tell it was dirty.  It also seems a little small but as you can see from the photos, it fits absolutely everything I need. I included a photo of my lunch bento which is NOT small. It fits perfectly. A 24 ounce water bottle also fits in the pocket next to my bento. I was too lazy to run down to my car to get it though. The front zipper pocket holds my inhaler, keys, 4 tubes of lip gloss/balm, two pens and a small tube of lotion.  My 15” laptop fits nicely in the back padded pocket. I can fit everything I need on a daily basis in this backpack. I haven’t used the charger yet but I’ll try it out tomorrow and update my review. I posted a photo of the bag full, and zipped up. Doesn’t look packed to the gills and as if the zipper is about to burst. The straps are comfortable too.  While I haven’t had the bag long enough to attest to its long-term durability, I’ll update this review when some time has passed.",

For example, there is a hidden zippered compartment on the back right under the shoulder carrying straps where she can put her passport, boarding pass, and wallet for safekeeping. Pickpockets can't get to it while it is strapped to her back, and it will be readily accessible as she goes through security and customs.  She loves her tablet and there is a compartment for that and for a laptop should she ever decide to buy one. They too are in quickly accessible compartments so they can be quickly removed when going through the x-ray machines at the security and TSA stations. Other compartments are also provided that make it easy to quickly get hold of items like a take on snack, notebook, medications, pens, and other items.  A very nice feature is the built in ports with wires connections. You can attach a music player on the inside jack to allow for an earphone or headphone to plug into an audio jack.
