Lucy Thompson,Love this top!! Great to show off your back :),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13UWW5TQ1PCIN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4TPLF6S,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"Grey Open Back Top ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) I’m obsessed with this grey open-back top! I wore it to the Dreamville Music Festival, and it was the perfect combination of comfy and stylish. The open back adds such a cool, breezy touch while keeping it casual and fun. The fabric is soft and breathable, so I stayed cool in the heat, and I got tons of compliments on the unique design. It’s super versatile too – I paired it with high-waisted shorts, but I can easily see it working with skirts or jeans. Perfect for any event where you want to look cute but still feel comfortable and free-spirited. Definitely a must-have for festival season!",

Rylee Williams,cute top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CBH1PO5LX632/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4TPLF6S,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 17, 2024",,Verified Purchase,It’s so cute but if you don’t want your nips showing you’ll have to wear sticky’s !,
Mal,Cute but could be better,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L1JDUTD4CQRT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4TPLF6S,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 5, 2024",,Verified Purchase,This top is very cute and flattering but what I dislike about it is that it always slips off. It doesn't have anything to hold with on the shoulders so it gets annoying always having to fix the sleeves when wearing this top.,
Lucy Gerstenschlager,different material than i thought,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3XGOKSC3SK1Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4TPLF6S,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 11, 2024",,Verified Purchase,it’s more of like a thick workout material so it’s pretty tight which is nice but also not what i was expecting. the arms are a little small and kind of fall down—they don’t feel super secure,
Vanessa,It’s okay,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SZ9JMZOGBA7M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4TPLF6S,"2.0 "," the United States "," May 8, 2024",,Verified Purchase,The top is really not practical- the sleeves will not stay up. I’m pretty fit and it just didn’t work.,
Riki Marlar,It bunches up at the neck and doesn’t sit right,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10V42FQAPMQ9E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4TPLF6S,"1.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2023",,Verified Purchase,Material is nice but the way the shirt was made it’s not wearable. Very awkward looking and doesn’t stay in place.,
Danielle,Worst free people dupe ever,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVJP36IHS9W5B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4TPLF6S,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2023",,Verified Purchase,This item is all wrong. Save your money and just buy the original. It slips off the shoulders and material is gross.,
