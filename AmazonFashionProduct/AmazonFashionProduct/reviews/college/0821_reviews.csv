Tedra1969@aol.com,Awesome sweatshirt zippers terrible three out of five were broken,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QZI6XCG8BTZR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09H3ZWV3S,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Sky Blue,Verified Purchase,I loved these sweatshirts that’s why I bought 5 of them. However 3 of the 5 had broken zippers. Amazon demanded I show them my drivers license I was confused and uncomfortable doing this. I contacted them within days of receiving them. Long story short Amazon will not help me with this issue they told me I had to contact the company I tried doing that nothing worked nothing I tried to find nor what Amazon provided. So I am now stuck with 3 expensive sweatshirts that I can’t use because Amazon was no help. I have been treated very unfairly by Amazon and I was hoping the company would replace them but no way to get a hold of the company. Buyer beware. It will cost me 30.00 or more to have the zippers replaced. I am very sad about this because I love the sweatshirts. If it weren’t for that I would have given them 10 stars. Shame on you Amazon If the selling company reads this please contact me to help thank you,

Thick enough to keep warm but not too thick to feel like I’m suffocating.

It’s the perfect size & I could probably even go with a small for the look I want. I’ll definitely be buying this in more colors as long as the quality remains the same after I wash it.",

When it arrived, I found myself looking at a light blue sweatshirt, but it was so soft and I like any blue, so I kept it, looking forward to wearing it as it got colder. I wore it a couple times and was so frustrated with the hood which just did not feel right. After its second wear, I inspected it closer. Something was clearly not right. The hood was not sewn right. There is so much material in the part folded on that it never lays right. I turned it inside out and looked at the hood. It laid so nicely. When I flipped it back though, the hood was not right again. It is as if the hood was sewn on backwards with more material in the inner hood  than the outer hood. I had passed the return date so could not return it. Fast forward to now, about a year later. I have only worn it three times, even thought I love how soft it is. The hood is too uncomfortable frustrating.",
