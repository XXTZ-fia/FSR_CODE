Elise,My new favorite backpack minus the logo,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28SQYS1BWCSB7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRHNJXDH,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 17, 2024",Color: Black,,"Firstly, I just want to mention how obnoxious the logo is on this. The thing is huge and it turns what could've been a stylish, minimalist backpack into an ad for a brand literally no one has ever heard of. I'm not sure why they decided to put such an ugly large font on the front of the bag but it drives me crazy and I hate it.  Other than that, this bag is great. Both a 12.9 inch iPad and a 13.6 inch MacBook can fit in here. It's spacious, it's handy, it's useful. Its comfortable. I love it. IIt could've been cute as well but...",

The only thing I find not so satisfying is the straps,
Rebekah,Stylish and functional!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZ5L21EEKDN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRHNJXDH,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 2, 2024",Color: Mint Green,,"This small backpack is well-designed! It's a bit bigger than your typical backpack purse but smaller than a regular medium-sized backpack, making it the perfect size for travel. It has tons of pockets for storing all your essentials, so everything has a place. Though the material of the bag is thin.  An interesting feature is the anti-theft design. Instead of a flap on top, you access the main compartment through the back of the bag. This adds an extra layer of security, which is great for crowded places or traveling.  Overall, this backpack is functional and stylish. It's ideal for day trips, commuting, or just as a casual everyday bag. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a compact but roomy backpack with great storage options and an anti-theft design!",
J. Robbins,Cute backpack with a spacious interior that will keep thieves at bay.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RWLN72FKOLX1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRHNJXDH,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 2, 2024",Color: Pink,,"I use a backpack as my purse whether in town or when traveling. It’ll be nice to have a backpack that is less accessible to pickpockets and thieves when I travel or when riding the subways in NYC. The only access to the large inner part of the backpack is from the back, so you have to remove it from your shoulders to get into the large interior of the bag.  The inner space is large enough to easily fit my ipad Air (4th gen), my Kindle, a library book, a wallet and other items…although it gets a bit heavy with all of that stuff in it. The outside of the backpack has a pocket on each side. The pocket size was big enough for a 16oz water bottle. There is a zippered pocket on each side of the backpack in front. While the zipper pulls are slightly recessed in a fold of fabric, they would still be accessible to thieves, so I wouldn’t put anything valuable there…maybe a map if you are traveling.  Inside the main part of the bag there is a large zippered pocket and two slip-in flat pockets, which would be good for pens or tall thin items. The interior of this bag is much more spacious than it appears on the outside. I don’t want to carry a huge backpack that extends down to my butt. Too many backpacks are made for men or very large people. I’m only 5’2” tall and this backpack is the perfect size.  The sewing and overall construction is strong and well-made. I tugged and pulled on the straps where they join the body and there was no problem with the seams, they held well. The fabric is soft to the touch but has enough structure to hold many items securely.  The straps are strong webbing, but I could have done without the huge name “MONICA MUSE” running up and down those straps. It was already on the front of the backpack and I think that’s enough name identification on a product. And it’s not like this fashion designer is a famous name that you want to show off.  Overall, I’m very happy with this backpack, especially for travel. I’ll be able to fit all my electronics, a drink, snacks and other important items safely inside.",3
Amy Lynn,Cute Little Bag,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDY311NX92REB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRHNJXDH,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 30, 2024",Color: Pink,,"Bag is light and has a nice design. Has a front compartment, a back and two slots on the side for bottles. It's made of a soft nylon feeling material and I like how the back compartment keeps everything nicely secure. It's small to medium size-  more of a mini pack- medium sized mini pack. Pink color is cute and it's easy to throw over your shoulder and take on the go. Recommended if you're looking for something light and cute.",
