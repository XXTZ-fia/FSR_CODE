I puts some duct tape in the corners in the hopes of extending the life of it, which did help some but now it has run its course. I am tempted to order another one but I really don’t want to waste my money on a bag that might rip under the weight of 4 16.9 ounce water bottles.  **Edit: a representative from the company reached out to me and not only offered but issued me a full refund for my purchase. I used that refund to purchase another bag because I really do like it!! I really appreciated the extra effort that was made in assuring that I was satisfied. That really means a lot to me as a customer!! I’ll do another update in a few months for the new bag I just received!! #Excellent customer service!!!  ***Edit: I am pleased to report that the new bag is holding up EXTREMELY WELL!! No rips or tears at all with this one so far 🤞🏽🤞🏽 I only use it for beverages and it definitely keeps my water and protein drinks extremely cold all day long!! I work from 6am-7pm and at the end of my work day my last water bottle is still ice cold!! I’m so happy the company reached out to me to give the bag another try!! They have excellent customer service!! I highly recommend this bag!!",4

It's made of nice, sturdy fabric, and feels and seems well made. I have not spilled anything in it, so I can't comment on it's ability to stop leaks.  I'm not sure why people are complaining that it's too small; maybe they need like three meals to make it through a day? It's big enough for lunch! The bottom is approximately 6x9 and it's around 10"" tall. It does have a zipper closure, which would be handy to keep things cold longer, but I just use it to bring lunch to my office where I put everything into the fridge, so I just use it to cart things back and forth from home to work and back.  I also love that it doesn't look like a purse because I often stop by the grocery store on my way home, so I don't want anyone to smash my window to grab it if I leave it sitting on the passenger seat while I'm in the store. I just make sure the top is open and people walking by can clearly see there's only dirty dishes inside.",5

It eventually dried, let the small water steam. I didn’t think anything of it at the time a few days ago, my coffee cup leak inside, and again the cloth got wet and when I looked inside the same seam of the liner was apart.  Not made properly obviously since the same problem happened again.",
