Also the straps don’t get small enough, I expect this is to make more room for the cross body option but it made the backpack option very uncomfortable.

It’s made of soft canvas/cotton and velvet with an embroidered design. I ordered it in Mulberry leaf grass. The colors are tones of beige, white, blue, and black. The silver zipper pulls are a teardrop shape with a cut-out of a leaf.  The front flap has a 3-D embroidery design and a magnetic snap closure. The interior is lined with tan/white herringbone nylon fabric and has a floating zipper pocket, an open pocket, and a side zipper pocket. While on the small side, there’s room for a tablet, eReader, cell phone, wallet, keys, notepad, tissue pack, sunglasses, and a few other items.  There’s a zipper pouch on the front for things you need easy access to.  Both sides have velour slip pockets for a water bottle or compact umbrella. The back of the pack has an anti-theft zipper pocket to protect your valuables.  To carry the bag, you can use the cute braided loop at the top to grab-and-go, or the convertible strap on the back. The strap has a zipper which allows you to zip it open to create two backpack straps. Or zip it closed and clip both straps to one d-loop and wear it over the shoulder or crossbody.  This is the cutest mini backpack purse I’ve seen and I can’t wait to show it off!",6

It is SO CUTE! I love the beads on it and the extra details that create a 3D effect. It feels very well-made, with a hefty fabric and sturdy stitching. The inside is roomier than I expected, with a few pockets for organization. My only complaint is that some of the beads are not stitched on very tightly and I worry that without reinforcement, they will fall off. Otherwise, I am so excited to carry it around and make use of it. So cute!",

I found it and put it back in the slots but it just wouldn’t stay there. Took it off and put it away so I wouldn’t loose it. :(  I don’t want to return it because This bag is full of space and the design is really cute. I spayed it with a fabric spray to help keep it clean because I used it to travel overseas. I will be using fabric glue to keep the girls hand in place as well as the green knit flower she is holding because it jumbles up and looks like a ball instead of a flower. I will Also attempt to glue the part of the magnetic closure back on. Hope it stays.  I’ll upload pictures.,6
