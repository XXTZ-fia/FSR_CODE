Aleia,Attractive,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AQYES3YOVJWU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CZ3WPNVP,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 7, 2024",,,I got this for my son’s high school graduation. It’s a very attractive bracelet and I love the fact that it’s adjustable. Often he has a hard time with bracelets as he has very large hands but relatively small wrists. This he can get over his hands easily and tighten up on his wrist. I wish the compass was a little darker on the metal but otherwise no complaints. The little message it has is also lovely.,
