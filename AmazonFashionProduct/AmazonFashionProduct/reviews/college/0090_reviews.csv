It’s also suuuuper cute! The only thing I haven’t liked about it is it doesn’t stay on the bag hook on changing tables very well but that’s so minor for me because it’s just suck a great size and has the perfect amount of pockets to stay organized.

This backpack has gold trim that really makes it look classy. The PU leather looks like real leather and is soft to the touch. The stitching has been done with care. The fabric on the inside is heavier than my smaller backpack purse. The front pocket has a zipper and has two divided compartments and a compartment that goes the full width of the compartment. The middle section has an inside zipper compartment that would be good for coins or pens. This backpack would make a great diaper bag, as it has two outside pockets on the sides that would be great for baby bottles, but also can hold water bottles. I use one for my cell phone. The shoulder straps are padded, but not bulky, and are adjustable. I’m thinking about using this as my everyday purse, since I often carry extras for my grandkids’ entertainment.",

I have seen backpack purses and they all run small.  My husband was looking at the pictures and reading up on it and said this one was bigger, so we decided to try it out.  I have been looking for a good size bag to put a big 3 ring binder in along with a few other things for a training class that I am taking.  A big bag would just help me to get that much more organized. Well, this backpack will definitely fit the bill!  There is not only one big opening, but two along with extra side pockets on the inside of one of them!  There is a very front zippered pocket that will open up a bit so I can use it as a purse.  The material on the outside is so soft and and very well done.  The stitching is solid and doesn't give the impression of pulling apart.  The zippers have a firm pull without being too hard, and they have a nice material hard piece to pull the zippers with.  There are two nice side pockets that you can slide a number of things in to.  Now, let me tell you about one of the most impressive parts of this bag. The shoulder straps are padded and feel great! Most of the backpacks that I have had do not have long enough shoulder straps because they are small backpack purses.  Because this is like the size of some regular backpacks, the shoulder straps are much longer and won't pull on you.  I can now wear this backpack and not have it pull on a heavy coat.  This really is big and I love it!  I can not rave enough about it!  I highly recommend it.",3
