We weren’t even sure how to adjust the sizing since it is a 2 pc set .. so since my daughter liked the top and I liked the bottom we decided to keep them she keep the top and I’ll wear the bottoms but I cut the excess material off for appropriate length and it worked out. We figured it could just be a mistake by the seller not sure but it ended up being a win win in the end. If they come mismatched in sizes that could definitely be a problem for others. And we did buy it as a set together, disappointed she couldn’t wear both but we adjusted! Giving 3 stars because it is comfortable to wear and keeps you warm but don’t wanna rate higher because of the mismatched sizing! Good luck! If I had known I wouldn't have ordered it!",

I have a bit of a gripe with the cost. Def would get more colors if the pricing was reasonable. In September this set was $30, but now it is $75 “discounted” to $53.

NOW the bottoms... :(  they are very unique looking, I just with the buckle was functional because I cannot get any of the three pairs of bottoms to stay up for the life of me.  They fit perfectly for about 5 minutes, but the fabric does not hold its shape and stretches the second I sit down or move the wrong way.  Maybe this would better fit a curvy body.  I am 5'3 and 140lbs and the bottoms float right at my ankles, so sort of a cross between high water and goucho? but with the design, I guess it works.  If I wear a fabric/elastic belt I don't mind wearing the bottoms to lounge around the house. but I rate this set highly because the jacket itself is worth it and the material is so soft and comfy to wear.",

The other reviews are right when they say that the pants bulge at the crotch so I had took my pants to the tailor for alterations and spent $30 to have them create another seam and take them in so they’re not baggy and stop that bulging- you could do the same. The top fits well for what it is but it’s weird how the top fits tight in the pants are loose. I might purchase again because they are very warm in the color is vibrant, but upset that I had to spend extra money because of bulging crotch issue. If you’re willing to spend around $80-$100(alterations included) for this set compared to the Frankies bikinis $300 set I’d say go for it.",29

The set consists of a top and bottoms, and overall, I am quite pleased with my purchase.  Let's start with the top. It fits me perfectly, hugging my body in all the right places. The knitted material feels soft against my skin, providing a cozy and warm sensation. The design is stylish, with a flattering neckline and well-fitted sleeves. I love how it effortlessly adds a touch of charm to my winter outfits.  Moving on to the bottoms, they have a slightly loose fitting, which I find quite comfortable. The relaxed fit allows for ease of movement and doesn't constrict my legs. Despite being a bit looser, the bottoms still manage to maintain a flattering shape, which is a pleasant surprise. The knitted fabric is just as cozy as the top, ensuring that I stay warm throughout the chilly winter days.  Together, the two pieces create a lovely coordinated look that is perfect for the winter season. The cute and comfy nature of this knitted set makes it an ideal choice for lounging at home or going out for a casual outing. It's versatile enough to be dressed up or down, depending on the occasion.  I have received numerous compliments whenever I wear this knitted set. Friends and family have commented on how adorable it looks while still being practical for the winter weather. It has quickly become one of my favorite go-to outfits for the season.  If you're in search of a cute and comfy winter ensemble, I highly recommend this two-piece knitted set. While the top fits perfectly, the slightly loose fitting of the bottoms still manages to remain flattering. It's the ideal combination of style and comfort, making it a must-have addition to your winter wardrobe.",21

When buying it I was skeptical about sizing. I’m 5’5, 185 lbs and I was going to get a XL at first but after reading reviews and videos I decided to go with a medium and I’m glad I did. The outfit is stretchy so it’s very forgiving with the sizing. However the bottoms are big in comparison with the top. I found it to be loose on my waist and having to pull them up every so often. And for me to be a typical size 8-10, I can’t imagine this outfit being able to fit someone that is on the thinner side, even with a size small. Which is unfortunate. However I will be repurchasing this outfit in more colors and I will probably size down to a small so that the pants fit a little better. But also I did order this outfit two weeks ago at $30 and now it is $46??? So I don’t understand the price jump especially considering that the sizing is definitely inaccurate and in my opinion not really petite girl friendly.

So before I wear them again I'll have to alter them and bring in the waist a few inches and hopefully that'll do the trick.
