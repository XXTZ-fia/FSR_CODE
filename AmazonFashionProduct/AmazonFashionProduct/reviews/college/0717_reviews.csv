The tassel included the current and previous year charm to change out if need be. Just be sure not to toss it out with the bag. It was well packaged and arrived in good condition. Trying to interpret the sizing chart was my only hangup. I ordered a size up because based on the chart sizes for arms, chest height etc, I was either going to order too short or too long, too long can be hemmed. The smaller size in my case likely would have worked. Though this one was longer than anticipated it doesn't drag so it works.",3

I attend commencement once a year, and I do own a few gowns. This gown is the least expensive gown in my closet. The fabric and the quality of the stitches are decent for the price. The fabric seems to be some sort of polyester. It has a sheen to it and is quite thin, allowing light to pass through during a bright sunny day. Considering the price and what you are getting, this is a bargain.",4

The fabric was relatively heavy - not cheap and flimsy like I might have been expecting.  The tailoring was as good as anything I've worn, and the stitching was everything it should be - no gaps or loose threads.  It was nicely hemmed at the edges, instead of just cut off.  The size was exactly what I hoped for.  The cap fit well, was properly-sized, and had some elastic on it so that it fit my head securely and comfortably.  The tassel came with last year's charm on it, but a charm for the current year was tossed into the bag.It all made me wish I really was getting some kind of fancy degree.I was very pleased.  Highly recommended.",
