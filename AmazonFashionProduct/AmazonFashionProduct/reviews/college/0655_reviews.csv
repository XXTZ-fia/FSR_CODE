I love the fact that it has zipper so that my things will not go flying out. It is big enough for me to keep my kindle in it as well as my small journal. The only problem I have with this bag is the straps. The material is too flimsy that it does not stay put and I can see that the material will mess up over time.,

Bekah Berndt,Hobo Tote Bag Purse (Color: Coffee)  …,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IN7TBAQKIPN2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CL8SCVKZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2024",Color: Coffee,,"I ordered this purse to match with my cowgirl boots and they’re almost the perfect color match so I was super excited about that. This purse is made of a different material than I had anticipated though it does state it is made of corduroy so Im not sure what I was expecting it to be. Nevertheless the fabric is soft and very smooth. Medium thickness. Nice lightweight tote bag. Inside it has the big main compartment with one small open side pocket. The shoulder strap feels comfortable and seems well made. The gold chain hoops on each side give it the perfect touch of classiness in my opinion. This tote bag is a nice average/medium size and I think it’s a really good value for money. It comes in three different colors so you can choose the one that fits you best. My one and only issue and really it is a personal preference I suppose more than anything, is that I am not a fan of how the zipper is made on this purse. I mean the zipper works well don’t get me wrong but if you look at my photos above you can see the zipper is only made to cover 3/4 of the opening. It just stops short at the last quarter of the bag and I’m really not sure if it’s supposed to be this way or if the zipper on the purse I received was sewn incorrectly,.. I just can’t understand why it wouldn’t be sewn across the entirety of the opening. The length of the zipper would match the length of the top opening too, but instead it is made to hang 1/4 over the one side and stops 1/4 short of covering the entire opening on the other side. Again I can’t make sense of it and personally I rather it be covering the opening completely and not hang over the side at all but this is the way it seems it was made for some reason. Someone else might like the zipper the way it is or maybe even understand why it is made this way but in my opinion I thought it was a little odd. Overall I still think it’s a really nice purse though.",5

Its a bag for casual weekends out with the girls for lunch or to shop. A few compliments from other women about the bag but nothing overboard. I would recommend it to anyone looking for style at a reasonable price",

It also has a very short strap. It was too small for me to wear on my shoulder, so it is a carrying bag.  With that being said, it is really soft and nice. I love the feel of the fabric. It looks really nice too. It would be great for carrying a notebook, folder, and a few other small things back and forth to work. I like the bag, it just did not suit my particular needs.",

And, don't get me wrong, I'm still excited, but a little let down at the same time. The sizing is a little smaller than I would like. However, I will still be using this one and often. It has a soft, suede like feel to the material. The brown coloring is a neutral color and I love it! It does hold a good bit of items, but I can't fit my iPad into as I would like, so that's why a little lower rating. But, overall I will still enjoy this totebag!",

To me it feels like it is made of suede despite being corduroy.  This lends it a brushed material look (vs shiny leather or quilted), that is a dressy casual.  The gold colored chains on the handles further it's dressy casual appeal.  This isn't the bag you bring to a formal event but for a day out shopping or having lunch with friends it is a perfect accessory.There is plenty of room in the bag but despite the ""tote"" statement it is not so massive you take an extra 10 minutes looking for your wallet.It is a comfortable over the shoulder wear.  The handles aren't very long, so a large winter coat might impede it being worn over the shoulder.",

I ordered the dark brown color and I really love the look of the bag.  The material is very soft and the bag itself is pretty spacious.  My favorite part of the bag are the handles, which are very elegant and pretty.  The reason I gave this bag only three stars is because the zipper does not go from edge to edge and close fully.  In other words, once the bag is fully zipped, there are two pretty big holes on each end, which would easily allow for things to fall out if the bag falls over.  I was a little baffled by this concept of the zipper not going all the way to the edge or even closer to the edge and kept trying to fix it and see why it wouldn't close all the way.  I could almost fit my fist through the hole on the end while the bag was fully zipped.  I think if there was no zipper at all and maybe just a button or clasp or if the zipper closed more, then this bag would be a fantastic bag. Overall, though, it is a nice medium size bag.",
