Holds a ton of stuff and bag itself is very light.  Went with navy blue and agree with other reviewer thar zips that match bag or are black would look better and more hi-end, but I can live with the gold.  But they do cheapen the overall look.  But I needed something to carry in and out of hospital each day visiting my spouse, so not that important to me at the time.  Main pockets have two zippers, a plus as you can grab both sides and pull closed much easier than single zip bags and be confident your stuff won't be falling out on you.  If you're thinking about this one. Buy it.  It's awesome.  Might work for preschool book bag but for me way too small for real book bag and heavy use with lots of books.  My notebook and a paper notebook and small hardbound book fit with no issues.  Cheers!",3

There are zippered pockets and pouches everywhere. Sometimes I couldn’t remember which secret pouch I’d stashed something in.  The smallest compartment is perfect for hand sanitizer, chapstick, tissues and small things.  The next pouch back I kept my pens in the pen slots and stored two of my tour’s Vox Box.  The third pouch was great for three of my books and my kindle. It also has a pouch for a battery pack with a cord to plug into it. Just bring a charge cable for your device and plug it into the USB attachment on the outside of the pack. 16oz water bottle would fit, no problem.  The back pouch was great for skinny items. I kept a Manila file full of travel docs in it.  My favorite zippered pouch was in the back of the backpack. We kept our RFID passport wallets in there. Because it rested firmly on my back I never worried someone was getting into the pouch. And I loved not needing a money belt!  The straps are adjustable and the bag is not cumbersome in size. It really is a small backpack that I took into all restaurants.  We used this on a 12 day tour of Germany. It stowed easily on the tour bus under the seat and in the narrow overhead storage. On the airplane I could stow under the seat in front of me and still have room for my feet. After 12 days of getting dragged and shoved everywhere the bag looks like new. It’s very sturdy and well made. This bag is my new favorite travel accessory.  UPDATE: Got my son’s Chromebook in the back pouch too! In addition to the books and everything mentioned above!
