I LOVE this purse. I still get compliments on it to this day. It was closer to $25 at the time (yay inflation!) but it is so worth the current cost. It’s held up great, even when I’m dropping it or tossing it around. I consider it my go-to purse. It matches everything, it holds everything, it cleans easily, and it’s a timeless look while still having a bit of personality. It’s got some puckering of the “leather” from age, and the strap has a string or two that have popped up. Both of those only if you look closely. But for nearly a decade of daily wear in all weather, from college parties and tiny lockers at minimum wage jobs, all the way to being worn into the office or out on date night with my husband- I’d say that this purse had held up beyond my expectations. I can not recommend this purse enough. Every time I go out to get a new purse, I’ll use the new purse for a few weeks before coming right back to this one. The size fits everything I could ever need and it’s so comfortable to carry. I fully expect it to last me another five years before I finally have to buy another. 5/5 stars!",

I prefer to carry it like a briefcase as opposed to over the shoulder but more often than not, I end up putting it over my shoulder anyways. But I digress. It's got a good amount of pockets and space. The front clasp isn't so easy to open and line up when closing with having to actually look down at it and watch what I'm doing.

I ordered another purse from them too that is slightly bigger. I use that one more in the winter since I have to carry around my gloves and hat in it. They will not fit in this purse. This one I am planning on using this one in colder months. I am hoping the clasp does not break on me again though and I just got a bad part. I rather not have to buy another purse for a while. I give the bag a 3-star rating because of this just because the bag so heavily relies on that clasp.  But other than that, the bag is super cute. It goes well with my rustic style.

THIS one is by far my favorite. While I have others that go with specific ensembles, this one can match both dressy and casual outfits, as well as jeans.  This purse is medium-small, which is really what I want. It's enough to hold everything I need, but definitely will not hold extra. It has 3 inside sections, a tight outside back pocket, and a front outside pocket. I put my wallet in the middle inside section, and some lipsticks and pressed powder in the other two. The back outside pocket is just a tight strip, so you can only fit a couple of business cards in it. In the front outside pocket, I put my phone. I can get to it without having to unzip the inside pockets.  I hang my keys on one of the metal loops on the sides, but the loops are also for the removable shoulder sash if you want to use it as a crossbody bag.  The material is real embossed leather, so it has some heft. I like that the style is a small version of an ""academic satchel bag"" carried by the stereotypical Ivy League professor in a wool jacket with patches on his sleeves. (Yes, that was the exact look I was going for!)  The quality is great. The leather is beautiful.
