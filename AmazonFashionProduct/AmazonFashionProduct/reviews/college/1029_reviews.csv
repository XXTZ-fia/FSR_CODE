Brenda Nelson,Paris T-shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OQ4ZEYC7K9LQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D442NB12,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 14, 2024",Color: BlackSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I wanted to have this T-shirt for so long and could not wait to receive it. When I was searching for the T-shirt, most of them were unisex and that is not what I was looking for as I do not have a straight up and down body, I am very curvy, especially on the bottom.  This particular T-shirt said it was a women’s T-shirt and so I ordered it. The size I would order in a regular women’s T-shirt. When I received it, it was a unisex T-shirt and I cannot wear it because it does not fit over the bottom of my body.  I do love it very much because I have been to Paris, but I will need to lose some weight before I’ll be able to wear it on my body.  The material is not as soft as I had anticipated. It is very crisp before washing and I have not washed it yet so I cannot comment on how it will be after washing, but the black is a beautiful deep color and the white on the front seems to be substantially put on.",
