Although it ""fit,"" there was no give to the material, so I should have ordered up a size.  Since there's no stretch, it was difficult to get both arms in the cardigan without pulling.  It did turn out cute, however if I'd had more time, I would have returned it and ordered a larger size.",

CBD,Low quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BTMV4YN3J562/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D44BDPMQ,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 25, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Lace Black,Verified Purchase,Bought this for a downtown/bar shirt and of course it came broken. The lace on the sleeves was torn. The sleeves were the right size but the top was much too big even for a girl with a larger chest so if you decide you want it size down. It’s being ripped already ruined it for me. I don’t recommend this item for its price since yours will likely come pre-ripped  or too large.,2
