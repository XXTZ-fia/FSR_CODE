PerezRD,Compact But Spacious,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2U6X018A2HSAZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CBK3NB7V,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 17, 2024",Color: Bp23st2-black,Verified Purchase,"The bag isn't very wide front-to-back, but I'm impressed with how much it holds. It also has a cushioned section in the back perfect for a small laptop, which I wasn't expecting. I love the handles so I can carry it like a bag instead of putting it on my back. I'm a digital nomad and I need good, usable bags for traveling; I can either pack this full and still have it not appear oversized, or I can use it for daily outings when I'm carrying less. At full capacity I can fit into this bag: one pair of thick denim leggings, 2 pairs of yoga shorts, 1 pair of yoga capris, 4 cotton dresses, 1 bathing suit, 2 lightweight long sleeve shirts, 1 oversized tank top, 1 pair of cotton drawstring pants, bras and underwear, 1 pair of flip flops, and various toiletries/travel necessities. (When I have it that full, I carry my computer in a separate bag.) Everything fits easily and it's small enough that it can easily be taken as a carry-on. Airlines are cracking down on size and weight of bags. No one is even stopping me to question how much it weighs because it appears small.  One thing: the straps are cotton and they rapidly start to fray. If you don't catch it right away the whole thing is going to unravel. Run a line of superglue over the end of the straps as soon as you open the package, and problem solved. I also feel like the cotton straps may slip right out of the buckle when I'm carrying it over my shoulder, and it may crash to the ground with my computer inside (this never actually happened). I put an oversized safety pin to hold the straps at my desired length.",

The Philosopher,Good backup but not very sturdy.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OCUYG8F6XNOL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CBK3NB7V,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 22, 2023",Color: Bp23st2-khaki,,"Firstly, I will say that the color is really nice.  It's a minimalist bag that's going to work with every outfit. It's very versatile, in terms of style.  It has a 14 inch laptop sleeve, which is really useful.  The issue I have is that the material is very thin. It doesn't seem durable or sturdy. Especially compared to other backpacks.  Another big con is the lack of pockets. There is not much room to store your things. Thus, it is limited compared to other backpacks.  Overall, while the backpack is a good value for money, I would honestly recommend you spend a bit more for something nicer and a bit sturdier.",

All lives matter,Useful smaller type backpack...or is it a handbag?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCQQ93QVII5SQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CBK3NB7V,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 18, 2023",,,"I got this backpack/handbag primarily as to use for the times I have a smaller load to carry and can't say I'm disappointed at all in this item. On the exterior, there are 3 pockets - 1 on the front, 1 on each side. The interior is divided, with a large pocket on the back part and then the space on the other side of the divider. Now the divider and the back side of the pack have about 1/4' foam in them, which provides the only cushioning in the pack. The odd part of the item is the fact that it has both back pack straps and the cloth handbag style handles - not really sure why. But I figured that, although I plan on primarily using it as a backpack, maybe there will be times it'll be easier to carry with the handbag handles...maybe? One last detail - the zipper handles are metal (not the usual plastic) and have holes in them large enough to put a lock through. Overall, given the affordable price, I'd say this is a good quality backpack that will prove useful for trips around the city.",
Chloe 🦇,Survived an international trip,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMC3WIS01TW2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CBK3NB7V,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 18, 2023",Color: Bp23st2-black,,"I used this black backpack as my personal bag on the plane for an international trip to Italy. I carried it around a long time on my back and wore it several days as we walked numerous miles, and it held up great and has no damage. It's very lightweight and did not irritate my shoulders or back even after wearing it all day.  Though it's a little on the small side, it was able to hold quite a lot -- I was able to stuff a purse, large water bottle, food, a book, and a change of clothes in it with plenty of room to spare. Make sure to read the measurements to see if it will suit your purposes. The straps are a little confusing to set up, but they never moved out of place once I adjusted them to fit me. It's probably safe to wash in the washing machine, which I will probably be testing soon as it got dirty. Overall, a very affordable and durable backpack.",

The only thing I find a bit annoying is that if you leave it a few days out it gets very dusty and it’s a bit annoying cleaning the dust out in that material, but other than that the backpack is great!",

It's smaller than your typical bookbag, but larger than a mini backpack. It's a good in-between size. A nice daypack for wandering around the city. Or for a casual hike. The fabric isn't rigid at all, so your back will be supporting the weight of everything inside. But for the size, you probably won't be carrying too large of a load. I like the handles up top that allow you to carry it like a tote as well. It's stylish and useful.",

I ordered her this and she likes it. I examined it and it is well made. I don't like the velcro attachments on the side pockets. The velcro is too strong and if you grab from the fabric rather than the velcro, I think it might rip off.  The back straps are thinner, which is fine because this is a dual purpose bag which can also be carried. I think it's a fun little bag, surprisingly well made (apart from that pocket velcro which I would change to a snap). It's also attractive and stylish.",

It is a lot lighter and softer than it looks. That means that I can scrunch it up when needed. The pockets on the side and in front are perfect for things like water bottles, bug spray, eye glasses, phones, note pad, etc. The hook-and-loop closures are much handier than zippers.

Especially if you are a person who wears many hats in the course of a day. This is perfect for my small laptop, and doubles as an excellent short hike backpack in the shoulder seasons when gloves, hats and scarves are quickly shed and passed to Mom to hold. The style is minimalist, which I loved. Sleek lines, durable (waterproof) fabric, and pockets where you need them, this bag is built for utility. Yet it's stylish in its simplicity. I really can't say enough about how comfortable it is and how intuitive/well-placed the zippers and pockets are. This is packed with kindness, and includes a sweet key chain teddy bear that likely isn't standard, yet made all the difference. This backpack will serve for so many special outings, and a sweet treat in the box served to bring joy. My rating is for the backpack, not the tender gift. But I do think this gift says something about the company marketing it and that matters. So, pay kindness forward. Have fun. Hike lots. Strap this to your back, shoulder, or use as a laptop carrier--for all your adventures. You'll be glad you did!",

She was excited about the color being sage green and it having an extra set of straps on top of the backpack, so it can be carried like a handbag as well. This bag has room for her laptop and four decent sized school textbooks. The external side pockets are perfect spots to easily access, but securely hold, any writing utensils or cellphones . The only thing she mentioned, and I agree, is the straps would benefit from a little extra padding. Otherwise this is a great option overall for a backpack.",

The shoulder straps are padded and adjustable. The only thing I didn’t like was that the straps are not threaded through the connectors and I struggled a little bit with that, but not enough to deduct a star.

I guess if you have a lot of bits and bobs you may want an organizer inside although there are pockets on the outside. For me, weight was the most important factor and my previous backpack had so many pockets and dividers it was just weighed down by them. My only preemptive concern is how strong the straps are. I liked that part of the straps were cushioned for comfort. The part that attaches to the backpack is secured with extra fabric, although I hope it’s secure enough. My previous backpack was thick canvas, which felt very secure. Here, I needed waterproof, which is thinner material by nature, so I’ll see how it holds up with the gargantuan amounts I carry every day. Took it for a test run in the rain and it held up well!",
