No drawstrings which is a big plus for me. I usually buy Large hoodies and this fit just shy of an XL for my dorito frame. A little stiff at first, I believe due to the acid washing. Yo can see the original color on the inside of the hoodie, which is way softer than the outside UNTIL you give is a nice wash and break it in some. Perfect hoodie to overuse and wear in to make even more vintage. 4 stars, very good, better than average (especially for a generic brand), and slightly shy of a perfect. 4.5 if I could.",

While an XL is my normal size, I'll occasionally size up if I know it's not coming from a known US brand.  Since this is described as ""oversized"", I stuck with my normal size and it was the right choice.  I would say order your usual size unless you like things tight.  This came vacuum sealed, so it arrived super wrinkly.  While I don't prefer pre-faded clothing, they weren't overzealous with the process and it looks nice.  It doesn't have that kind of orange tint that you see when pre-fading gets out of hand and they use too much detergent or detergent with too much bleach.  This sweatshirt does not have a drawstring, which is something I have come to appreciate.  Really, the only thing I use drawstrings on my sweatshirts for is chewing on them.",

Not bad by any means, as I like my hoodies a bit over-sized so I can comfortably wear a long sleeve shirt or something underneath and not have it feel tight. As far as quality, it seems very decent. The hoodie is mid-weight in my opinion, and though it's not real cold her yet, it should keep me warm. We've had some cool mornings that require a sweatshirt, but it's not down into the 30s or 40s yet. Just some 50s mornings. Overall I'm happy with it so far.

Absolute perfect “oversized, boyfriend sweatshirt”. Obsessed is an understatement. The color and wash is 100% accurate to the product photos (my photos make it look a bit more vibrant/bright than it actually is for some reason) It’s giving “worn in” in the best way. It’s also plenty oversized. I am a 5’7 female and ordered the small… which is perfectly oversized. I probably could’ve gotten away with a medium too…but much bigger than that and I might’ve looked like I was drowning in it, haha. But this size looks so good with jeans, sweats, etc.  It’s also super soft and cozy to wear. It’s not the thickest sweatshirt, but it does have some weight to it, and has the soft layer inside. It lays nicely on my body. I just know I’m going to wear this thing all the time this fall/winter. I will say that it is definitely on the more expensive end of things when it comes to price, especially for a sweatshirt…but it does look and feel like good quality, so I’d say it’s worth it!",3
