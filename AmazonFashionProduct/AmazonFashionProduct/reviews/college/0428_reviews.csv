The 2 piece soft stretchy fabric is so comfortable and not wrinkle prone,  The royal blue color is that ""greek blue"" that is my favorite.  When I opened the shrink wrap clear package, i thought I had received the wrong order,  The long sleeved top - slightly cropped seemed to look like xxs size 00 with skinny arms and neck.  It is super stretchy but arms and neck are tight on me.  The bottoms looked like a full load of laundry about 30"" wide at the hip and all down through the legs.  The much smaller waist band is wide and comfortable.  The length does drag on the ground in flip flops & sneakers.I assume the fit is for a much more full booty with smaller waist & torso than my square thinner shape.  I am keeping it because I love the feel & color for a great lounge outfit & and maybe short errand run, but all day out, I probably would look like I had on ill=fitting sloppy bottoms.

I'm 5'2"", 160 lbs, and have that delightful mom pooch, so I'm super picky about pants and how they camouflage that. The pants were loose enough throughout the lower tummy area and the material heavy enough to drape nicely without being clingy, but also high waisted enough to give me a really defined waistline. The top, at the size I purchased, is too wide in the shoulders, so that will likely be just a layer in colder weather for me. The pants are a little too long to wear with sandals or flat, but are good with a little bit of a platform sneaker. So far I've paired the pants with a cropped tank and jean jacket for a casual look, but I'm going to style them with a shirt and jersey blazer for days in the office. I'd definitely buy these again.",7
