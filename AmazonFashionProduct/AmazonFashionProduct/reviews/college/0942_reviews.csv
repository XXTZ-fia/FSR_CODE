megan dronenburg,Not at all what I expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XIBYGV3OAZNW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08SXSNJSJ,"1.0 "," the United States "," February 6, 2023",,Verified Purchase,It says the shirt is supposed to be for a female and fitted and it’s not at all! It says it’s supposed to be a large which is my normal size and it’s about three sizes too big and the material feels Christie and looks very faded,
Anna,Love the message & comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13MJBNBN7JGF8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08SXSNJSJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 12, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"Love the message of this shirt, which is the main reason I bought it. The shirt is also super comfortable! It does run fairly large in my opinion. I ordered a women's cut small and it was loose everywhere. Still worth it!",
