M@3gan,Poor quality false advertising,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FACXJJMV8XOL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNKKMN22,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2024",Color: Original-white,Verified Purchase,"OVERALL The bag was MUCH SMALLER than advertised as well as being flimsy, having poor stitching, and the cup holders being so small they are rendered useless. STRAPS The straps hold the bag oddly and tilts the bag forward in addition to folding it in half, and yes it does that even when packed full (I was filling it with my stuff and I picked it up and well… STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY In the product images the bag appeared sturdy and capable of holding heavier objects however when I put less than 2lbs (4.4kgs) I heard a seem pop. Which is strange for “double stitched” I checked it was not there was one layer of stitch made of thin thread.",

When I first received it; it felt flimsy and poorly constructed and knew it wouldn’t last. It comes with a label indicating a 6 month warranty which I saved, but it is still under Amazon’s return policy so I am returning it to them.  It is true to size but not to scale as shown in the product photos of the people in the library and on the street. It is much smaller. You can’t even fit a small water bottle or umbrella in the outside pockets as shown.",

Kindle Customer,Isn’t the best messenger bag,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T0N9JXBLLLEH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNKKMN22,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2024",Color: Original-white,Verified Purchase,"I had gotten this bag at the beginning of the year, and had already noticed signs of loose stitching on the straps and some of the insides as well, but for the first two months it held up together pretty good! The bag itself is exactly as described, I was able to fit my computer, folder and notebooks in there quite well. Throughout the later months though, it actually broke on me and I had to stitch it up myself and not only that, there’s beginning to be stitching coming undone from the inside as well. For a bag that isn’t even a year old, I would hope that it would’ve lasted longer than the almost 8 months I’ve had it. I used the bag primarily for school, so if you’re not planning on carrying a lot of things in this bag, then maybe it’s a good choice for you, but as a school bag it doesn’t exactly meet my standards.",

The biggest problem I have with it is the pocket on the outside that is supposed to hold a bottle. That pocket is tiny. I'm not sure what cup they have pictured in the ad, but none of ours will fit. We can barely squeeze a plastic water bottle in. The rest of the pockets and compartments are ok. It serves it's purpose.",

It's a bit hard to fit my water bottle in the side pocket, but it does fit.  The front right pocket fits my wallet and my work name tag, and the front left is able to fit snacks I carry with me. I also use the top flap to fit more snacks in.  I have noticed no tears or anything, its just gotten a bit dirty. The strap is a little uncomfortable, since its just a single strap that has no padding or anything, but its okay. Very great bag for the amount of money I paid!",13
