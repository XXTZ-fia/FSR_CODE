You can fit sooo much inside it, and even when it's just about at max capacity it'll still fit under an airplane seat. The canvas it's made of feels very good quality, and I've had it for a while now and used it on several flights and it still looks great, no broken zippers or fraying anywhere. The color that I got is also very accurate to the pictures (on my screen, at least). There's a ton of pockets, and while I usually just use the laptop one, I like them when I need them. I haven't tried the phone-charging part yet, so I can't say how well that works. The horizontal straps on the back of it mean I can easily rest it on my larger luggage if I'm going to be stuck in an airport for a while. Also I keep referencing flying because I feel like that's the target audience for this but I also just use it any time I need to take my laptop (or anything that can't fit in a purse) anywhere. If I had to choose something to nitpick about it, I'd say the ends of the zippers sticking out looks a little strange, but that's literally necessary for the bag to open at all - you pretty much need to unzip it all the way any time you need to get something out of it because of how the top part is designed. If they changed it at all, the bag wouldn't be able to hold as much, so in the grand scheme of things I totally don't mind it. The zippers themselves are also great quality, I've had no issues with them so far. They feel sturdy.",

I only have the 20m old in diapers. We always have a pack of wipes, 3 diapers (Pampers Snugglers size 4), an extra outfit. I really appreciate the flat pockets; we try not to bring too many toys with us, and we have 5 Boogie Boards from the Target $5 area. They fit perfectly in this bag, in a flat side pocket.  I don't use the wipes outer pocket, and I do wish it was a pocket without that hole. I don't use the phone pocket as much as I'd like but oh well.  I do like how it opens wide, although, if those bars are turned funny, it can stab me in the back sometimes and it's unpleasant.  Color is great! Overall a great bag. Would like to buy more.",
