I do plan to wear this with the sleeves rolled up a little bit.  I like all of the different fabrics that are on this jacket. Reminds me of something you would see on the Dirty Dancing movie.",

My experience with the jacket, upon receiving it myself, was filled with the following notable features and highlights:  - The overall aesthetic of this jacket is chic meets casual; this garment can be worn on a dressed up night out for an elegant dinner or pair it with jeans + a tee for a night in with friends, or a house party. Your choice!  - Maybe it's the way the jack is supposed to fit but it does fit rather large on me, especially around the front-side of my body because its quite baggy. It's not a deal-breaker though and will be handy during winter!  - Construction of the jacket is very well put together, with double-stitching that ensure the pieces of the garment will not come apart after a few wears and the material is super-soft to the touch.  I highly recommend this jacket for fashion-conscious individuals who want a staple in their closet that never goes out of style! Or, even for those people who want to purchase an affordable bomber jacket without putting a permanent dent in their wallet.",2
