Texture-wise, think cheap Halloween costume material. Color-wise think super cheap digital type print. The print coverage isn't good and there were flaws. I wanted to love it, but it's just extremely cheaply made and not at all as pictured. Considering returning, but it's really too late to order something else and get it in on time for the holidays. So... buyer beware. If you're sensitive to cheap fabrics this is not the garment for you.",
