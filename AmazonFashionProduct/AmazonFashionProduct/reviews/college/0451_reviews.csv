I reordered the sweatshirt in black, and when it arrived, it was completely different from the first shirt. Way too short and wide, made of thin, rough material, and the collar was sewn incorrectly so it stands up weird in the back and looks awful. It is unwearable. The first shirt was thick and soft and perfectly sized, just the wrong color.
