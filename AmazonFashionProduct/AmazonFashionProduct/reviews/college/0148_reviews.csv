As many other people have pointed out it is a loose-weave knit that will be prone to catching on things, so extra care should be taken both in wearing and washing the garment.  I put it in a lingerie bag so it wouldn't catch on anything else in the washer, used a cold water gentle cycle, and line-dried.  It came out as nice as before it was washed.
