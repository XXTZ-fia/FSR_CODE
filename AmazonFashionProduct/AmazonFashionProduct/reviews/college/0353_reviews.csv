So pretty, the material was great and not see through at all. It can be worn on or off the shoulder. I typically wear a M and that’s what I ordered, but I probably could have sized down.  The way that the dress ties in the back makes the sizing pretty forgiving. It stayed in place the entire time even when off the shoulder. Overall, I’m really happy with the purchase.",4

Especially dressed. I'm 5'2 185lbs. Normally wear only dresses . I'm a 37 waist  and 45 hips and 41 bust. So I ride the very fine line between a large and extra large in most everything.  One is too big and the other too small. My torso is very very short which is what makes things so difficult. This dress hides my back rolls perfectly and is the ONLY thing I'm able to get away with wearing WITHOUT A BRA!! I LOVE IT. The double layer perfectly held my ladies while adding a layer to hide my nipples. Lol. Very versatile and the material is perfect for warm weather. Can't say enough about this dress. I went a size down. Getting the large instead of xL. So glad I did. Any larger and it would have been too big.,
