It fits my laptop perfectly (its 15.6 inches), my notebooks for my classes, pencil case, calculator, etc. It holds a lot, and I've been extremely happy with this purchase. The straps are snug and very comfortable on the shoulders. I will say that the ribbon unties itself very quickly, but a tight double knot should hold it up. Otherwise, I definitely recommend it!",

Her previous backpack felt heavy empty and was worse  with her notebook and water bottle inside. The bag also did well in the rain. I worried that it would soak thru when it rained last week. But nothing inside got wet ( and it was pouring). It’s only been about 3 weeks, but it still looks nice. Because of the material and light color, I thought it would be a stain magnet. Not the case at all.  #noregrets ( I’m laying in bed as I do this review or else I would have included a picture)",8
