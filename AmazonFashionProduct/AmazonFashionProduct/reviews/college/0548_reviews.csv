It’s always a hit or miss with clothes on here so I set my expectations low, however, this was a HIT!! I own a similar one (the material feels exactly the same) from DKNY 3x the price and this one is extremely comparable. Not exact but feels the same. The material is super soft and comfy!! It looks good and has a nice stretch to it. Definitely recommend and I will be ordering more for sure.",
Island Gal,Adorable puffy shoulder shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUDW3ZCOKN7LM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5DBG2SF,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 6, 2024",,,"Love my new MEROKEETY crew neck pullover knit shirt.  I wear a small size, and this is perfect.  The sleeves and the overall length is great, and the material feels soft and smooth.  Seams are made well, and no hanging threads…which I appreciate.The colors pop clean and fresh.  True pink stripes and a nice bright white.  The puffs at the shoulders are fun, but not too puffy.  Quite feminine.I will always wash in cold water and hang dry.  Don’t want to lose the color or shape.  This sweater is a great addition to my summer wear clothes.  Very happy.Highly recommend!",

I ordered a medium, and it is true to size. The apricot and black is a perfect neutral. I can be worn with almost any outfit  5’3” 155 pounds 32DD",
