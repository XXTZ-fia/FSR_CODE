Eric Brown,"No inner lining, do not buy",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14YXOTXJJOI5B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKNZZQHQ,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Large,Verified Purchase,There is no fuzzy inner lining inside. The picture clearly shows there being a fuzzy lining inside and mine just came with a rougher almost towel like lining. Almost like it wasn’t finished in the factory. Definitely not as warm because of the lack of lining. Do not buy these.,

The material is thick and comfy.  I am not happy with the fact that the cuffs and the edges have what look like small incisions every so often... if you wash this enough, the material will start to shred at those points.  I guess that is a ""look"" it is just not one I am happy with.  It is a shame, because otherwise, this is a great hoodie.  Despite the heavy material, which is great, I would never pay this much for an item that will look worn and trashy after a few months of wear.",

Chelsea D.,"""oversize"" is not an exaggeration",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OG5RWQMWKKI8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKNZZQHQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 21, 2024",Color: GreenSize: Medium,,"Nice, cozy oversized hoodie. I do believe it is sized more for men. I'm normally a women's large and ordered a medium--it is VERY oversized but that's what I wanted so I'm fine with it. My partner wears a men's size large and it's loose on him as well.  It is more than 50% cotton so it's going to be a bit stiffer than people may be used to for full synthetic materials. However, I prefer natural materials for environmental reasons and it does make the hoodie extra cozy.  I got this in green and while this should be common sense, definitely make sure to wash this alone for the first go. I washed it with dark clothing but one white sock snuck it's way into the load, and the sock is now a lovely mint green (my mistake!).",
Jennifer,Acid Washed Hoodie,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26U8A0NQY8RLS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKNZZQHQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 20, 2024",Color: Deep BlueSize: XX-Large,,This hoodie seems to fit true to size. I usually wear a 1XL but I ordered this in a 2XL so that I would have room to wear other shirts under it and use it as an extra layer underneath my regular coat.  It would stand fine in its own as a in between season outer wear. The denium type material shows the faded stone washing color quite nicely.  It really gives the hoodie that well worn comfy look.  It does not have sweatshirt fleece material on the inside but it's really not needed with the thickness of the denium like material.,

Heavy and bulky but not warm. I walked my dog this morning in 50°. My regular sweatshirt keeps me warmer. The neck is a bit tight but the hood stays up. It's cool looking and comfortable but not really a practical jacket. I got the Medium because I knew it would be oversized and it's my regular size for tops. I've washed it in cold water and dried it on permanent press. This color did not bleed and did not shrink. I am 5'5"", 145. Their description says you can go to a party orgy and surf in it. IF I do wear it during either of these activities, and haven't drowned from wearing it in the ocean, I'll be sure to edit my review with an update!",

The fit is true but oversized, so I ordered a small instead of my regular medium and it fits perfectly with plenty of space (I am 5'5, 145 lbs, usually wear an 8/10, 38C chest and 31"" waisted female). However, the material was a bit of a disappointment for me. I expected a really soft feel, esp on the inside, and instead it is kind of a weighted material/heavy feeling but super thin at the same time. For the price, I want it to feel luxurious when I put it on. There doesn't feel like much of a lining inside of it, and it isn't overly soft. Hopefully with multiple washings, it will get softer. It truly reminds me of a thin denim material in appearance and in how it feels.",

The acid wash finish gives it a unique vintage vibe, while the oversized fit provides a laid-back, trendy look. I also appreciate the ribbed cuffs and hem that help maintain the shape.  The kangaroo pocket is spacious and perfect for keeping hands warm or carrying small essentials. This hoodie truly works for everyone. The loose, oversized style makes it great for layering or just wearing on its own for a relaxed vibe.
