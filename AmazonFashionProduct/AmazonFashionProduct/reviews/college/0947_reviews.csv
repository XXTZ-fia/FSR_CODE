Price notwithstanding, it's a perfectly fine garment with a lot going for it. But when you factor in the price tag, the quality doesn't quite measure up, so it doesn't feel like particularly good value for money. However, as they are purportedly officially licensed, my guess is that the the bulk of the cost stems from the licensing fees.  --- PROS:  • The sweatshirt looks just like the photos on the product page. I've lost count how many times I've ordered an article of clothing online, only to receive something that bears a mere passing resemblance to the images on the website. I'm pleased to say that this was not the case here. The cut, color, and graphics look exactly like the photos, so what you see is what you get.  • It fits just as expected. For context, I'm 6'0"", about 165 lbs., and have a swimmers build. I generally prefer more fitted tops, so smalls tend to fit me best in the torso, although the arms are always inevitably way too short. So, in this case, I bought a medium. As expected, it was a bit roomy in the torso, but the arms were the perfect length. I don't exactly swim in it, but it is slightly baggy, which is what most people want in a sweatshirt. For now, I'm fine with it because it's looks comfy without being ridiculously oversized.  • It's comfortable to wear. Like most sweatshirts, it's pretty darn comfy. The outside is your standard sweatshirt material, with a soft fleece interior that feels really nice against the skin.  • This is a silly thing, but the drawstring is just right. I don't know if anyone actually uses the drawstrings on hoods, but I never do, so I'm generally not a fan of them, especially since they're often so ridiculously long or impossible to pull through the hood material. However, I'm OK with this one because it's the perfect length, the cord slides easily through the hood material, and the color matches the fabric. It's long enough to be functional, but short enough that it isn't a distraction or in the way every time you bend down.  --- CONS:  The overall quality keeps this from being a 5-star garment and makes me question the value for money.  • It's an inexpensive wholesale hoodie. When I ordered it, I expected to receive a sweatshirt that was manufactured by Barnesmith. But when I received it, I was surprised to see the tag and discover that the sweatshirt was actually made by Gildan, a brand I regularly see in the apparel department of my local discount department store. In fact, I own a few plain, un-decorated Gildan hoodies that I bought from said discount stores, and they were only a fraction of the price of this one and generally not super high quality.  • Regardless of the clothing manufacturer, the quality of the material and the stitching isn't the greatest. I don't think that it's necessarily about to fall apart at the seams, but there were several loose threads on the interior that needed to be cut and even a few on the outside (see photo). It's the sort of issue I'd expect from a discount brand or a garment that I only paid a few bucks for, but not for apparel at this price point.  • I've worn and washed it a few times according to the directions on the label, and I've noticed that it appears to be a magnet for fuzzies. Even when it's fresh from the dryer, if you look closely at the material, it's covered with teeny white specs of lint. It's barely noticeable unless you look closely, so not a huge deal for me. However, even when it was right out of the box (before being worn or washed), there was serious pilling on the interior, which is not something I'd expect from a brand new sweatshirt, regardless of the quality. Generally, that only happens to me after years of regular wear and repeated washing. Again, not a huge problem necessarily, since no one will ever see it, but it does make me question the quality. That said, most of the Gildan hoodies I've owned over the years have lasted quite a while, so I assume that this one will probably have quite a long useful life as well, which is some solace.  --- BOTTOM LINE:  All things considered, this is a decent hoodie that looks good and feels good when you're wearing it. The color is spot-on and the printing is perfectly executed. However, when it comes to value for money, it feels like a stretch at this price point, especially given the overall quality of the garment itself, which is adequate but not great.",

It would make an terrific gift except for the identified deficiencies discussed below.  As seen in the video portion, I found a number of loose threads. After the video was finished, I discovered another seam along the top of shoulder with an unraveled thread. That can be seen in the video at about the 2:25 point on the left shoulder which is on the right in the video. I cut the thread off but I suspect after use and washing, that shoulder area is going to open up requiring repair or be discarded.  This type of fault exhibits poor quality control and manufacturing. I photographed that defective area.  Be cognizant of sizing as this could easily have been ordered up one size.  I went three stars because of what I consider sloppy manufacturing. I expect better for a product of this price point.  Three Stars * * *",
Doug Thompson,"Medium weight, not heavy weight.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLNOY32IFMM1Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM9PRP4S,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Central Florida Knights - Black,,"PROS: The stitching is nice and well done.  Logo is crisp.CONS: Price was just under 50 when I received it.  I expected more at that price such as embroidered logo or heavy weight sweatshirt material, especially since they claim that it is heavy weight.  Much lighter than my Carhart material.BOTTOM LINE: Three stars because of the ""price per pound"" factor.  Call it medium weight or make it truly heavy weight.  Hope this helps.",
