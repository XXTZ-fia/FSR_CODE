Width qualifies as oversized, so the overall shape/fit is a bit odd. Also, if you don't have it zipped up, the odd bit of extra fabric on the inside (on both sides of the zipper) constantly gets in the way and/or turned inside out.

Also, the sizing is a bit large. I normally wear an XL (to be comfy and not snug), but I could have gotten an L instead. If you need something to wear on cold days, this will do the job. You can layer it under a larger coat on really cold days, but if the temperature hovers around 50 or 60 degrees then THIS is your coat. Full stop. Also, I hear people comment on the zipper and they're not wrong, the zipper is a little difficult but after wearing it for awhile it seems to have become easier. I also hang it in the closet with the zipper all the way up, which helps.",
