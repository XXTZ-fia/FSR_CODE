Besides that I’m 100% in love with this very comfortable set. The fit is somewhat boxy yet very cute and chic. I don’t believe there’s been any shrinkage after washing - it seems that it washed very well and gets a little softer after each wash. I think these are the perfect pajamas that I can still wear into the late morning or early night if I change early. They’re presentable and cute enough to wear around other people and comfortable enough to happily sleep in :)  10000% recommend,

From its luxurious feel to its stylish design, this pajama set offers everything I could ask for in terms of comfort and aesthetic appeal.  First and foremost, the material of this pajama set is absolutely divine. The waffle weave fabric is incredibly soft to the touch, providing a cozy and plush sensation against my skin. Despite its softness, the material also feels durable and well-made, giving me confidence that it will withstand regular wear and washing without losing its comfort or shape.  The design of the pajama set is equally impressive. The two-piece short set features a relaxed fit that is both flattering and comfortable, allowing for unrestricted movement while lounging or sleeping. The shorts have an elastic waistband that provides a snug yet gentle fit, ensuring they stay in place throughout the night without digging into my skin or causing discomfort.  The color of the set is a beautiful shade of blue that is both soothing and stylish. It's the perfect hue for bedtime, creating a serene and tranquil atmosphere that enhances my overall relaxation experience. Additionally, the subtle waffle texture adds a touch of sophistication to the design, making these pajamas look as good as they feel.  Another aspect that I appreciate about this pajama set is its practicality. The lightweight material is ideal for warmer nights, keeping me cool and comfortable without overheating. Plus, the easy-care fabric makes laundry a breeze, as the set retains its softness and color even after multiple washes.  In conclusion, the Soft Waffle Material 2-Piece Short Pajama Set in Blue is a must-have addition to any sleepwear collection. Its combination of luxurious comfort, stylish design, and practical functionality makes it a standout choice for anyone in search of the perfect pajamas. Whether you're lounging around the house or catching up on beauty sleep, this set promises to deliver a dreamy and restful experience night after night. Highly recommended!",
