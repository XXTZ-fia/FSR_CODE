NES,"As A Proud Alumni, I'm Glad To Show My Fighting Mascots Pride",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32T6YK1H26NLN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07FMVTWDZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 8, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Purchased for a ""Pep Rally"" themed work event.  Pros: -Font and style will make it pass as a normal looking university shirt to casual glances -Joke lands without being too corny or obtuse. -Color selection was great -Feels like a better quality shirt than the price would suggest  Cons: -Material is somewhat thinner than I'd like for a shirt I want to keep in rotation for a couple years. That said, it's better than what you'd expect for the price.  Overall: 5 Stars For what was going to be a throw-away purchase, this shirt has definitely exceed expectations. The joke is concealed enough that most people will have to take a look at it before they realize its a gag. It's shocking comfortable for the price and the lettering isn't the material that immediately begins to flake off after one or two washes.",
