Andrew,Decent Quality Sweater,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OYEECY8JSZ2O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCBWCLJF,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 3, 2024",Color: 0-coffee CrewneckSize: XX-Large,,"So... this sweater is very warm and soft for being knit polyester. It's also machine washable and didn't seem to shrink (but I don't use a high heat setting for either the machine or the dryer). There is no neck tag and the elastics around the bottom hem do keep the sweater from laying flat against your body (it kind of bunches up).  I will say beware the sizing chart, because this sweater is enormously oversized. I have a 45in chest and about 26in shoulder length. So, judging by the hyperlinked sizing chart, I got the XXL. However, the pictured sizing chart is actually closer to the actual dimensions of the XXL: 56 in around the chest/stomach, 28in across the shoulders and 22in sleeve length.  I assume 'length' refers to the shoulder length. So I probably only need a small or medium. So be careful!  I think $30+ is a bit steep for an intentionally baggy brown sweatshirt with nonsense writing on it, but I do think it's comfortable and warm.",

Sjon Woodlyn,Nice but I worry about cuffs,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UNGWHC41E1Z1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCBWCLJF,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 28, 2024",Color: 0-navy Blue CrewneckSize: Large,,"This polyester sweater looks stylish and is of better than average construction. The photo shows how the sweater looks, which is not bad. The sizing is mostly accurate, this is the large size and it is a little larger than expected, which is nice in a sweater since you will expect it to shrink a little from washing. The washing instructions are clear and printed on a tag inside closest to the ribbing at the bottom of the sweater.  The material feels good to the touch and it is not too heavy. Wearing the sweater feels good too, and it is perfect for a cool fall day. The only reservation I have with the sweater is that the ribbed cuffs don’t feel strong enough to stand up over time. Since I don’t have an issue with the ribbed cuffs now, this is just a caution to those who might be hard on cuffs.  I like the sweater and I have added it to my collection of fall sweaters.",3

geoffwood,Faux college sweater,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18RPU2J534HGX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCBWCLJF,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 9, 2024",Color: 0-navy Blue CrewneckSize: Medium,,"This is a meeting of two of my favorite styles, aesthetic English (i.e. nonsense) and faux college athletics. I was a bit concerned with the sizing on this guy since there's no real clear guidelines and it's obviously an import, but it is broadly in line with American clothing norms. Maybe a hint small, but it's kind of hard for me to adjust for the curve of sweaters normally being baggy. I got a size smaller than I would normally wear in a shirt, and it's a relatively tight fit, if that's what you're looking for. Major advisory, these do run on the short side, sitting square on my waistband pretty much. If you are taller and/or carry some belly, you may wish to size up or avoid this entirely. But it's soft and I like the styling.",2

In any case, the quality level is really solid here.  This sweater has a nice weight and isn't thin or flimsy at all.  It's kind of oversized in my opinion, which is interesting for a top described as unisex.  This one runs big, so keep that in mind.
