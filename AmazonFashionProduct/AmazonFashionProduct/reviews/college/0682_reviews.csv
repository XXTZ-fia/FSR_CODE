Once it got aired out, which took a few weeks of taking it places, I don’t notice any smell at all. This backpack purse is roomy and can accommodate a bottle of water or multiple glass cases, a brush and makeup. And that’s just the main compartment. I keep my phone earbuds and charging cable in the front pocket and there’s a handy flat pocket that rests against your back when the bag is worn. Great product at a good price. This is my second bag. One thing I did notice is it shows signs of wear if it rubs against anything while wearing or carrying it. The fabric begins to fray.",

I liked all the compartments/pockets to help keep things organized. The bag's material is durable and water repellent.  I tried many different bags of this style/size and what I like most about it is the strap design. The way the straps are attached allow for the bag to stay centered on your back even when your contents inside have shifted and are no longer balanced. Other bags often would go lopsided. The bag also hugs your back for its full length. Other bags that I tried would gap near the top making it not feel very secure. The buckles on the bag are easily adjustable and you can adjust them without taking the bag off.  I bought this backpack to wear while walking around a trade show conference. I was able to fit a water bottle, camera, a compressible lightweight jacket, and small toiletries inside. It really carried everything I needed for the day. Really happy with this purchase.",

Nova,"Great bag, not so great straps (+ zipper broke)",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23890EVVKQ4EP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07HD9R425,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 18, 2020",Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"UPDATE 2/2/22: Looks like they completely changed the straps and made them much better. Will buy again and see how it feels and how long it lasts!  I love the bag- it's small but wide which makes it feel larger and allows me to fully close the bag with my larger water bottle in it diagonally. The material is nice and waterproof, and so far the zippers are working perfectly. There's also a BUNCH of extra pockets, have zippable, everywhere, which is super nice plus for a small bag. My big issue is the straps. They are not the pull on-to-adjust ones- which all bags totally should be - but instead they are the ""stylish"" belt-prong kind. The problem with that is the straps are hella long and only have several holes near the ends, which makes the bag lay super low and uncomfortably on your back even adjusted to the highest hole. Feels fine if you're a teenage girl it seems, gathering from pictures in the other reviews, but for a functional adult, it feels very uncomfortable not being able to tighten it any further. For reference, I'm 5'3 and 125 lbs. The reason why I still rate this 4 stars is because I've made it work for me. I worked with my grandpa to use a match and needle to burn through the strap and create what feels like an even yet WAY higher hole at the top of the straps. I mean, it's genuinely crazy how low the few holes are on the straps. The straps are still incredibly long so the large unused portion of them still dangle awkwardly much further than it looks like they should, but I got used to it and I love the bag itself so much that I can get over that minor inconvenience, especially because now my straps are the perfect comfort level now with my new higher up holes.  UPDATE 1/14/21: A year later, the zipper broke on the main pouch. First the zipper split then when I zipped it closed the slider yanked right off. Right before TSA needed me to get my phone out of my now closed bag. So I had to cut a hole in the top (3 layers thick) so bummer about that. Wish the zippers lasted longer than only a year.",11

Exactly what I was looking for. I needed a small bag to take on my trip but was looking for something that looked more like fashion and less like a backpack. This was definitely it. The inside fits my journal, a small notebook, my glasses case, eyedrops, a small wallet and a bottle of water. Don’t let the picture of the model fool you. I uploaded a picture of my Michael Kors bag in comparison to this one. The size is small enough to carry places and not bother you, yet big enough to carry essentials. The outside is also nylon but looks fancy. It is indeed waterproof as I took it to the sink and got it wet to test it. Inside it has a two compartments and a zipper compartment to put more important things. The zipper on the back helps a lot because you can keep your money in it if you’ll be traveling by bus and are worried about someone snooping in your bag when your not looking. The zippers stand out as well and mind that the color in the picture is a little lighter than in the actual backpack.",13
