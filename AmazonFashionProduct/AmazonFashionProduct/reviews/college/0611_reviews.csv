MICHAEL PETERSON,Inconsistent Fit & The “FASHION” Logo on the Front,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F4L0AHBSR824/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5Y1WFC6,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 9, 2024",Color: PinkSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this hoodie for my wife to wear during a Breast Cancer Awareness Run, hoping it would keep her warm yet comfortable for a day that involved both outdoor exposure and physical activity. While the hoodie has its strong points, there were a few issues we encountered.  The hoodie feels substantial and offers solid warmth, comparable to a Hanes Heavyweight hoodie. The fabric is a blend of 60% cotton and 40% polyester, which provides a good balance of softness and durability. It’s ideal for cooler weather and offers that cozy, comfortable feel you want in an oversized sweatshirt, making it a good buy for the price. The oversized fit gives it a relaxed, stylish look, making it perfect for casual outings, runs, or layering over workout clothes. The front pocket is a nice touch, offering both a convenient space for essentials and a bit of extra warmth for the hands. The hoodie’s overall design is trendy and would look great paired with leggings or jeans, just how my wife prefers.  Although the oversized style is a plus for many, the fit can be somewhat tricky. My wife found it wasn’t quite right for her body type—it looked too boxy, and the sleeves were a bit too long, making it uncomfortable for active movement. Sizing down might help, but it would be great if the fit was more adjustable to accommodate different body shapes better. While the hoodie’s look is generally appealing, the “FASHION” logo on the front feels unnecessary and a bit distracting. A plain, logo-free design would be more versatile, especially for those who prefer a cleaner look or are buying this for events or athletic activities. The logo limits the hoodie’s appeal for those looking for a simple, classic sweatshirt.  For the price, this PRETTYGARDEN hoodie is a decent choice, especially if you’re looking for an affordable, warm, and stylish option. The fabric quality is good, and the oversized style is trendy and cozy. However, I would recommend double-checking the sizing and keeping in mind the prominent logo. I ended up returning this hoodie due to fit issues (plus there was not enough time to get a replacement in time for the Run), but I may consider reordering in a different size later on. For anyone looking for a budget-friendly oversized hoodie with warmth and a trendy look, this might still be worth a try.",5

My only issue is that the neck hole is bulky and small and the sweatshirt material only has but so much soft stretch, so it's not terrible cozy, but it is cute.
