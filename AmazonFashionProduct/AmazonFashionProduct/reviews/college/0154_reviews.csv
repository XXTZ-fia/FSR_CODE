ErikTheRed,Love this shirt!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38Q56SOQIK6OR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2LBVZDK,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 12, 2024",,,"Love this shirt! It has a very nice, soft cotton feel yet there is a nice stretch to it. Love the oversized fit for extra comfort. The print on the front and the back is very well done. I can tell it will not come off in the wash. Light weight and perfect to pair with anything. Very happy with this purchase.",
Nichole S.,No Stretch,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19ZANT680W0R4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2LBVZDK,"1.0 "," the United States "," July 26, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I was really looking forward to getting this Fourth Wing t-shirt, but I'm super disappointed. It finally arrived today, and after trying it on, I realized the shirt has no stretch to it at all—it's stiff. It's also too small. I typically wear an XL but like my t-shirts a bit bigger, so I ordered a size up. I couldn’t get it over my chest. I do like the graphics on the t-shirt, but the color is a little more yellow than it looks in the product photo. Unfortunately, I was excited to wear it, so I washed it and can’t return it. Overall, very disappointed.",
