brendabren,"Works with a 17"" Laptop with workaround",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLDY6H8FUAE1T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BVVNF76Q,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: 17.3 inchColor: Quilted Black,Verified Purchase,"I spent a long time searching for a professional yet stylish backpack that could accommodate a 17"" laptop. The reviews for this bag were excellent, and I loved the design and features. However, I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 5 due to issues with fit and functionality.  The Good:  *The design is sleek and professional. *The outer side pockets are spacious—perfect for an iPhone or a water bottle, with easy access. *The straps and fit are comfortable on my 5'3"" frame. *It’s fairly lightweight and manageable, provided you're selective about what you carry.  The Not-So-Good:  *The bag is front-heavy, even when empty. Using all the front compartments makes it lean forward, which disrupts the balance. While I can counterbalance this by filling the main compartment, it defeats the purpose of having so many pockets. *The biggest issue: the laptop sleeve just barely accommodates a 17"" laptop. With the laptop in place, the bag's capacity is severely limited. Overloading the main compartment makes the front flap misalign, and the zipper becomes impossible to close. *The rigid back panel exacerbates this issue, as it creates tension that affects the bag’s ability to close properly.  Final Thoughts: If you use a smaller laptop, this bag would be a 5-star purchase. However, for larger laptops, the limited capacity and balance issues are frustrating. I’m keeping the bag because it’s stylish and suitable for travel, but if you're buying it for a 17"" laptop, be prepared to pack lightly and carefully.",

It’s amazing how much stuff this bag fits. I packed my toiletries and personal care items in this bag, as well as extra clothes, sandals, and electronics. I love the fact it has the strap to hook onto your luggage handle so I was able to be backpack free in the airport. Another one of my favorite features is the fact that the top opens wide almost like a square so you can completely see down into the inside. There are also extra cupholders on the inside to steady bottles or drinks you may have packed. So many extra pockets means you will never run out of places to store your things. It really is the perfect travel bag!!!",

There are plenty of compartments to hold what I need and my full size water bottle fits in teh side pocket without an issue.  The ONLY thing I would fix is making the suitcase strap a little more heavy duty.  The backpack can tend to slide a little.  However, the strap is still going strong.
