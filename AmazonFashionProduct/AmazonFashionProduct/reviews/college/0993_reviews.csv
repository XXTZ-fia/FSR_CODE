This dress is a good option for me, not just because it works with the climate I live in, but also because I’m 5’3” tall, so the dress hits right at the knee for me, which is where I want it. Also, I work from home, and this is a comfortable option that still looks nice on camera because it has a collar.  It’s a very plain dress, but can be easily elevated with a belt, a silk scarf, etc. I use a capsule wardrobe and this is a great addition.  The only things I don’t like are that it doesn’t have pockets, and the fabric is a little odd - more like scuba fabric than the sweatshirt fabric I was expecting.

She chose the XL based on the sizing chart, and it fits her perfectly, accentuating her figure in the most flattering way. She loves that it’s versatile enough to dress up or down—she’s already worn it with a cute belt and tried pairing it with a long necklace and wrist jewelry for a bit of flair. The color options were fantastic, but the navy blue was her favorite, and it looks amazing in person.  The fabric feels lovely and soft, with none of the odd odors or stiffness that sometimes come with new clothing. It’s ready to wear right out of the package, which is always a plus! If you’re thinking about sizing, take a few moments to measure yourself and check the chart—this one is true to size, but each sweater dress can vary. She finds this dress perfect for cooler days and evenings and recommends it highly for anyone looking for a cute, modest, and feminine option that feels as good as it looks. A definite go-to for fall and winter!",
