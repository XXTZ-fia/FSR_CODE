Andrew,"Excellent Backpack, Cute and Utilitarian",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EHW4SCUYI7A9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN8RVCGY,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 12, 2024",Color: Khaki,,"I've been using this backpack for a few months now and have been very surprised at the quality of the bag.  For how much you’re paying, it's far more substantial than I was expecting. I would go as far as to say that I have paid twice as much for bags before and have been disappointed with the quality, this is not one of those cases.  The material is a faux leather that looks fantastic and feels premium. I love the cream color; it’s neutral but pops enough to make a small statement while going with all of my outfits.  The utilitarian aspect of this bag is second to none. I have plenty of room for all my textbooks, laptops, chargers, and even snacks. The amount of compartments and pockets is not something I’ve seen before on a bag like this and is really impressive.  The main pocket has plenty of room for all my textbooks, I like how it has its own individual compartment as it helps to keep things separated and organized. Rather than sharing one with the laptop section as backpacks often do. It also can hold my extremely heavy books with no problems at all.  The individual laptop compartment accommodates a 14” MacBook super well. According to the description, it will fit up to a 15.6” laptop. It does a great job adding a layer of protection with padded material and keeps things organized by having its own separate pocket, which is something I didn’t know I would appreciate as much as I do.  The two pockets on the very front have been a great place to keep all my miscellaneous items; the bottom section is the perfect place to keep my pens, pencils, and highlighters. While the top section has room for my chargers, small electronics, and even snacks.  Honorable mention goes to the two full-sized water bottle holders on the side of the backpack. Not something that I expect to see on a compact, backpack like this. It fits my large water bottle well. I even got it to fit a bottle of wine on one occasion!  If you’re looking for a cute bag that is also useful, I can’t see how you could do better than this. I have been nothing but impressed with this bag from day one and it hasn’t let me down.",

Amari,"Not As Big As Expected, But So Many Pockets",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23K9S5EHUEOW2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN8RVCGY,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2024",Color: Khaki,,"I am slightly disappointed since this can fit a laptop, but it is a tight fit. This, to me, is more so a laptop bag made for going to school or work, rather than one that can be geared towards travel. Especially since there isn't enough padding (at least to me). But, at least with the material, it may say waterproof, but I feel like it is more resistant (but who is going to submerge a laptop book bag anyway?).",3

A Thoreson,Professional and Protective,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8T0AVWK0IABT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN8RVCGY,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 30, 2023",Color: Khaki,,"What sold me on this backpack is the water repellent feature! My laptop is essential to my work, and I used to cringe with my old case while walking through the parking lot on rainy days. I poured a cup of water on this bag and none of it soaked through to the inside even when I rubbed it in with my hand. If liquid is spilt on the inside, however, the fabric is wet, so be aware. The stitching is well done, and zippers are good quality. It’s roomy enough for the typical supplies, books/folders, and laptop items one uses for work. The colors are vibrant. I chose the khaki, because it’s unique. Everyone else always has gray or black. This reminds me to stay innovative, think differently, give each day a new clean slate. I’m excited to use this backpack.",

Biggins48,"A Practical Everyday Backpack, Not Ideal for Travel",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1743Q1EICR73I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN8RVCGY,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 24, 2023",Color: Khaki,,"I recently received this backpack, and I appreciate its unique coloring and design, which adds a touch of style without being overly flashy. While I value its extreme lightweight construction, I must admit that it almost leans too much towards being lightweight, which raises concerns about its ability to provide adequate protection. The multiple small exterior pockets on the outside enhance its convenience for accessing essentials on the go. Additionally, it features spacious pockets on both sides that can comfortably accommodate a thermos or water bottle. Inside, there are two compartments; one is fairly roomy with additional pockets for organization, while the laptop compartment is secure but doesn't leave much space for anything else. While I might hesitate to use it for travel due to concerns about durability and protection, especially for my laptop, it excels as a practical, lightweight everyday bag.",
Rick Montoya,Very Study and Attractive Backpack,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1A77756B8QL7I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN8RVCGY,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2023",Color: Khaki,,"This Bluboon Laptop Backpack is very well designed, it has so many zipper compartments and pouch areas to place just about anything you normally need to carry. It’s very sturdy, zippers open and close easily.  The Khaki color is vibrant and looks expressive as well as being comfortable on your shoulders. Very fashionable looking for gift giving and the value is awesome.  My wife has an older one that needs replacing and this will carry her laptop, wallet, phone, keys, etc, it’s like a very secure purse too.  Very satisfied with its design, functionality, color, materials and value. We’ll highly recommend this beautiful backpack to everyone who ask about it. Great gift idea for Xmas or any occasion.  5-Stars 🌟",
