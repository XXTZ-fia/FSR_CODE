The fabric feels nice and the construction quality is very good. It's fully lined so it’s not too thin or see-through but it’s still light enough to breathe. You can also wear it on either shoulder because the front and back are essentially identical. Love it!,
Jocylin Belgica Bovet,Size up if you have a long torso or larger chest,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VLO2H3LGOBD6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSXKB1K4,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 9, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,,This top is exactly how the picture looks and is quite comfortable. I wish I did size up once though just because I have a longer torso and larger chest but it is really stretchy so getting my exact size was okay still. The fabric used is really soft and doesn’t damage in the wash on a regular cycle. I usually hang dry this just to keep it looking nice for multiple wears.,4
