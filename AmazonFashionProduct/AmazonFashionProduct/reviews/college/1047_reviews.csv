It is decently thick, but not super thick which is good because if you’re going from outdoors to indoors you don’t want it super thick or then you’re too hot inside. I haven’t had any pilling issues but they are still fairly new so we will have to see in a few months how they hold up. I do wish it was a tad longer and then it would be 5 stars.",
