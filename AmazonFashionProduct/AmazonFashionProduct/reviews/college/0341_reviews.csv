They feel pretty good on and look fantastic. While the stitching DOES seem to be top-notch, I still have concerns about the quality. The inside padding is not secured to the shoe. For me, this is a problem. I am active. When shoe padding moves it is uncomfortable. Additionally, the shoes overall are heavier than I expected. While I am ok with this and it did not affect my review score, I still feel it is worth mentioning.",

No intention of testing them in court sport situations.  That being said, these fit very well.  The size crossover is accurate.  Put them on and walked around for a bit.  If I were trying them on at a store, I would have likely purchased them.  The khaki color goes with almost everything and can pass as a non sport shoe.  Almost a suede look.  Will see how they wear.  They did not come in a box and were plastic wrapped.  Might be the future of online shoe purchasing. There were plastic inserts in each shoe to keep the shoe's shape.  These shoes are well worth considering.",
