SquirrelVee,Love this backpack,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2K28VS7FIGNB4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYC3MWJH,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Color: Green,Verified Purchase,"I got this backpack on sale, but it would have been worth the full price if I'd paid it. It's well made, the color is lovely, and it's held up to some serious abuse while traveling. There's a lot of space without the backpack feeling bulky (I'm a small person, so backpacks can be overwhelming on me) and it packs down flat to stow away when I'm not using it. I might buy another in another color because I like it so well.",

Small enough to take a few things, large enough for my laptop - and this fit the bill perfectly. It doesn't have many of the features other bags have, most of which I never used anyway. My only complaint is in the magnetic fasteners for the front pockets. If you don't line them up perfectly, they don't work at all. But other than that - I'm very happy.",

KB,Functional and Cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M7X2RP0WY10L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYC3MWJH,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 17, 2024",Color: Green,Verified Purchase,"I love this bag! I’ve needed a smaller laptop backpack for times I’m not lugging my entire life around. This suits my needs perfectly! I can fit my purse-like items in the middle pocket and my computer, pen pouch, and notebook in the back, along with a sweater/sweatshirt. The front pouch is great for things I need to grab quickly. The snaps are magnetic so they are easy to snap back together. The bag itself is pretty comfortable to wear. It’s nice and light, and easily adjustable. I really love the color and style too. I’ve taken it to one meeting and got compliments on it already.  The only drawbacks are the side pouches and the thickness of the laptop padding. The side pouches are small. I fit my favorite water bottle in there so it works for me, but it does need to be a thinner bottle. The padding for the laptop sleeve is on the thin side. So, like most things containing laptops (tablets, etc), I wouldn’t toss it around.",2

My daughter didn’t like the style but I thought it was alright. It looks pretty much like the product photos. I bought it because it was similar to a backpack she already had but the dimensions seemed bigger. I returned it because it wasn’t any larger than the one she had. The large compartment is only about 5” deep, so the 6.9” depth  has about 3” of small front pocket. That didn’t give her any extra useful space to fit her binder, folders, laptop, etc. It wasn’t worth keeping.",

My MacBook fits in it snuggly and I have room for lots of other things. I like that the outer most pocket is quick and easy to open. I can slip my phone in and out with one hand with ease. It gets compliments and the colors are great. I've also traveled through airports with it and it fits easily into teeny tiny overhead compartments and can fit under the seat in front of me. Several months later it still looks great.,

Yes it is very spacious and could fit most laptops and many tablets too. I could fit my s9 ultra without problems but I'm not gonna use it. It lacks ruggedness. They should have at least provided more protection at the bottom. That way, you just don't alway have to gently put down your bag. I remember getting my iPad 3 dented on one of its corners like 13 years ago so now, I'm very careful with the bags I put my gadgets in. If you don't mind these negatives though, it's a great bag. It's good quality and stylish too.",3
