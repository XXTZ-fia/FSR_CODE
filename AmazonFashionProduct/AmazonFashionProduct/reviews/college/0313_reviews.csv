TMB420,Piling,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11UJL3AI4D60F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8YW3Z6T,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Size: LargeColor: B - Coffee,,"Purchased from Shea Whitney’s recommendation list: After 1 wear (about 3hrs ) I noticed it was piling in the front at my chest, after further inspection it was also piling at the right hip area and left shoulder. Took me a minute but then I realized it’s right where my crossbody purse lays (leather bag & guitar strap) Then I washed with like materials (did not dry) and noticed even more piling at the wrists and and underarm. I literally put this on went to my besties house to exchange gifts and went to the movies. I did not have my crossbody in this whole time. I wore it into the movies but took it off while in there and wore it out of the movies. So a total of 15 min tops. I’d return it if it weren’t past the 30day return window. I hate I didn’t wear it sooner but it until recently it hasn’t been that cold around here. Clothes these days all have polyester in them and I think that is what causes this piling. Anything I have that has polyester in it seems to pile. I have a sweater shaver I’ll have to use but who wants to have to use that after every wear. I finally gave up ironing but it seems like just to swap it out for sweater shaving! If you still want to buy inspire of the piling for reference I bought a large for an oversized look to wear w leggings and it was perfect for that look. A medium (what I normally wear) would have worked for a true fit look. Giving 2 stars because it fit just as I wanted it to and it is soft, comfy and WAS cute before the piling. I wear shave it, and wear again using a different bag. But there isn’t anything I can do about the wrists and underarm area. I’ll try to update if using a different strap helps.",

No help. I've used ""wrinkle release"". No help. A few of us Moms ordered the same shirt so we could have it personalized with our player's name and number. I think mine is the only one with this issue so it could just be a fluke. If it were black, you'd probably never see the differences in coloration but because it's the light purple, you can. I went ahead with the personalization (because I thought I could wash the wrinkles out) so I'm keeping it and will wear it. But just FYI...if you get one that appears to be wrinkled, I'd return it.",
