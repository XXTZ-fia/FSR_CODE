There are 2 water bottle pockets on either side of the back pack but they are a little on the small side and I had to work a little bit to fit my bottle into the side.  I found one pocket to be slightly larger so that my water bottle could fit in. If this back pack does get a few rain sprinkles on it, it is easy to wipe off and from the little bit of moisture that gathered on my pack, I didn't notice any inside the pockets.
