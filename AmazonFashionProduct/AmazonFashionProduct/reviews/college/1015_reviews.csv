Only problem is it’s obviously cheap and you can feel it on the felt/fabric part.  It continuously sheds. The inner lining is VERY thin and rips away from the jacket easily.  It’s not terrible but now that I added the patches and it’s a nice design, I’m afraid the jacket itself just won’t hold up.",3
