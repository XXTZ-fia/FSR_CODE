I always purchase smalls but ordered in a medium as that was recommended, but the top creeps up if not tucked in. I planned to wear them through the winter but will not be able to wear the white as it’s thin.  The fabric is definitely warm so they are good for a warm base layer as they hold in body heat. The cut is extremely slim.  For reference I’m 130lbs and 36C.  These shirts are tight.  On the plus side, the length is great for short ladies who don’t want to deal with all the extra fabric /length so many tops have. I would only recommend these if someone is looking for a base layer and order a size up.",2

They're very flattering especially the black long sleeve. I've washed them both now several times and have had no issues with color bleeding. When mine came I had to do some trimming of loose threads on both of the long sleeves on the shoulders but since then there has been no unraveling and they're holding up well. Because of the cut and lack of tag/label on the neck it can be hard to tell until you put the shirt on which side is the front and back which is a little annoying but overall these were a win and have been in my rotation.,

I usually wear a size m/lg. I purchased the lg and the long sleeve fits and the bottom does not roll up. The short sleeve version fits tighter snd does roll up. I will return snd try XL.  The fabric is extremely soft and smooth. It is not sheer or shiny so if you get your proper size the fabric will be forgiving, meaning that it will not emphasize any lumps etc. it looks like a quality piece and staple that you can wear casually with cargo pants, or professionally with a pencil skirt or pants. Because of the material, this will be flattering on your arms whether your arms are smaller or larger, as long as you get your proper size. This will also disguise those chicken cutlets if you have a little extra weight between your arm pit and bra.  The waist stops perfectly right above your natural waist if you have an average size torso. This will not be a short top that will show your stomach. It is however fitted and therefore if you want to show off some abs, you can tuck under and still look neat.  Highly recommended for ruler. Inverted triangle and pear shapes. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR APPLE SHAPE BRVSUSE THIS WILL EMPHASIZE YOUR PROBLEM AREA.  Recommended pairings: Ruler or inverted triangle shaped: Yoga pants, jeans, pencil skirt  For pear shape: Cargo pants or skirt, maxi skirt  Recommendation: Size up one size to prevent the shirt bottom from rolling up.  Hope this helps someone.",13

And body fitting so that it does not have bulk under the summer dress.  I nearly fit into it yet good enough.  Not comfortable this way.  A size up would still be tight.  Like an undergarment.

But the black one is definitely worth the money. The only thing is it's really cheap so the seams on the end come out pretty damn easily. But if it's in black u can't really tell and if you can sew it's no prob,2

The medium fits great but I think a small would have worked as well because of the stretch to the material, but I am extremely happy with the medium. The medium still has a fitted look which this style looks best. I will be purchasing other colors. I highly recommend these tops.",6
