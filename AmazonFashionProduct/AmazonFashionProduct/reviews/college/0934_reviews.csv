For example, durability is compromised in the zippers especially as they CONSTANTLY are going off track, out of line with the other side and just forming holes while zipping or unzipping that cause the zippers to jam, the pocket to get jammed together and not able to get contents in/out, and obviously causing a huge headache to try and get them to realign or the zipper to get back together enough to close or open it again. And the magnets link ok when you line them each up and click them, but they’re magnets so I was hoping if the flap was closed over the bag and it’s zippers they would find each other to latch once you had the magnets by each other. But they aren’t strong enough, so if there’s a day where the zippers won’t cooperate let alone leave the bag wide open that magnet flap feature would be a great help to keep the bag closed until repair or replacement was able to happen, but instead you’re cradling the backpack with open pocket or pockets sometimes it’s so frustrating! I will say that in terms of fabric it seems durable, love the color, the branding or logo patch is a little obnoxious, but it doesn’t draw much attention so most people haven’t mentioned or noticed it too too much. Plus it’s a laptop backpack right? So a section inside the bag and then holes at the end of the zippers don’t make that into aN efficient laptop backpack. Put a hole in the side pockets then you can lock the zippers shut? Or put a padlock into it. Even the sides could have had a headphone/charging port or holes or literally anything most provide you, because the price is of that efficiency in the bag yet it’s just not at all in the actual bag itself. If it was going to lack any of those kind of security elements but still be of solid quality backpack that’s one thing, but to charge the price of ones that do offer at least good quality construction and materials let alone are offering security features and tech friendly ones etc too, it just doesn’t seem worth the money whatsoever in this case.  Again I feel bad having to say meh it’s not worth paying that much for what it’s offered on here, cause it’s cute and could serve a temporary purpose to stand in for a real bag or while waiting to find a quality one, but just know you won’t have too long until you realize it’s not going to hold up for a long time and you’ll need a new one sooner than you likely intend when purchasing. It still zips most days and it’s never been over packed to cause the zippers to separate it’s just the quality lacking in them that take the bag down a good bit in its overall usability and efficiency for sure. I don’t mean for any of this review to bash or hate on the product because I could’ve returned it for the defects had I went to use it in time, but unfortunately just started using it a few days or so after the window closed, so that was not an option once they were known. But can say again the color is just as described/pictured and I like the style of the bag, but that’s about where the line ends on compliments because it has not proved to be useful and at this point may never be usable for The purpose of protecting and transporting very expensive equipment or laptops around in, or at least not something I would be confident or comfortable with leaving my computer or any tech item in and not leave it open to pretty much any one who spots it or walks by. So that’s my things or issues with it, maybe others didn’t have the same, and if not then great happy for you, but in my honest opinion I just wish I could like the bag more as anticipated, however there’s only so much you can overlook or do without before it comes a nuisance rather than any help or use for it.",2
