Emmz,Very comfortable jacket,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18OF6OKLG4TJK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRB4Z67,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 26, 2023",,,"This jacket is so lightweight and comfortable. The jacket is constructed perfectly, there were a few long threads that had not been cut, but that was an easy fix. This jacket, from afar, looks exactly like a letterman jacket you would get from school, but up close, the material is more like a high-quality hoodie without the hood.  I am so impressed with the structure of this jacket. This jacket runs true to size, so if you like your jackets larger vs. fitted, I would size up one. I am 6 foot with broad shoulders and usually wear an XL. I ordered an XL, and while this jacket fits perfectly around my waist, it is a hair away from being too short on my torso and arm lengths. When I purchase my next jackets I will be sizing up one size.  The material that this jacket is made from is very high quality. I honestly wish the letterman jackets from school were this comfortable and light. I think this is an excellent jacket for cooler weather in the spring and fall, but for cold winters, you will need to wear something under the jacket to stay warm enough. The inside of the jacket is a fuzzy fleecy material that feels great on your skin. The outer part of the jacket feels just like a really good quality hoodie. This jacket has metal snaps for closure and no zipper. The snaps are very secure, and I love that they put a white plastic cover over the snaps; they blend in perfectly with the jacket.  Overall this jacket is perfect, and I personally will be ordering more in different colors to match different outfits. I think this would make a very thoughtful gift.",3

Honey child,Very nice,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FXYA50BHSR1Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRB4Z67,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 13, 2023",,,"Such a good look. I purchased this for my 13 year old son and it fits great. He loves the look and the softness of the fabric. He also loves how versatile it is. He said it’s lightweight and can be worn in the winter with a nice thick shirt under and in the Spring with a simple t-shirt or alone, buttoned up of course. It washes well on the casual setting. I dried it on a low setting and took it out of the dryer after about 3 minutes and hung it and it was perfect. Though it doesn’t wrinkle much, this prevented all wrinkling. It does not fade or shrink and it’s quite durable.",
P. Kingsriter,"For the Price, a Nice Costume/Fashion Piece, but Runs Small, Very Thin",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XODAB6TO5I23/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRB4Z67,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 8, 2023",,,"For those reviewing this item and criticizing it for it's build quality, well, you can't expect a proper letterman jacket for the price of a sweatshirt.  So, buyer, please bear that in mind.If there's one thing this jacket absolutely nails is THE LOOK of a letterman jacket.  The contrast color sleeves, buttons, and striped cuffs, collar, and waist are all great accents that give a look of authenticity. While an actual letterman jacket would have a proper internal liner, a thick and warm outer layer, and probably leather sleeves, this has none of those things.  It's slightly thicker than your average wind breaker.  The chest and the sleeves are made of the same soft and comfortable material.While this certainly looks like a letterman jacket, it doesn't feel like one (for the reasons mentioned above).  I don't know that it's necessarily a bad thing.  Letterman jackets are very warm and that can limit how and where they can be worn comfortably.  The thinness of this material would make it perfect as a costume (think Back-to-the-50's Party or school play).All things considered, I'd love to rate this as 5-stars, but it does run small for a jacket.  It's almost as if they sized it as a shirt.  If you intend to wear this over a shirt (and I can't imagine you wouldn't), I'd recommend going up a size.",
William Hardin,"DO NOT RECOMMEND. Way too small, missing button snap and not the proper material.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UHETLDYD1LZO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRB4Z67,"1.0 "," the United States "," May 4, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"Wow. It is been a while since I was as disappointed as I am in this garment.  1.) Sizing. The sleeves were fine in length and the arm spacing was fine for me BUT would likely be not nearly big enough for most men purchasing a size Large (the size I ordered).  But that is not all. The main body of the jacket felt and looked like a men's Small not Large. My wife was immediately like, ""well, you aren't wearing that but maybe the kids can...""  2.) On my jacket, one of the snaps for the button to snap into was just not there. It was never sewn not was it caught by any type of quality control. This is a core issue with the functionality of the garment.  3.) The material used to make the jacket are fine but it is not the type of materials used in the real jackets nor will it be as durable or easy to clean. It is all soft thin sweatshirt type material. I have seen women's fashion versions done like this but not men's ""jacket"" versions.  It also was not lined in any way, just so you know what to expect.  I am sorry but I can not recommend this at all.",

Forever Young,An Iconic & Timeless Piece At A Reasonable Price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18GFN8F1F5T8Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRB4Z67,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 26, 2023",,,"A varsity/letterman jacket for men is like a little black dress for women. It’s an iconic & timeless piece that every man should have in his wardrobe. This jacket is so versatile because you can wear it casually with jeans or sweatpants, or make it look dressy by pairing it with slacks & a dressy shirt. I love how the fabric is mostly cotton therefore, the jacket isn’t too heavy & will be easier to wash. Double the love on the ribbed knits around the neck, cuffs & base - staying true to the classic varsity/letterman jacket style. The inside is lined with fleece so will add some warmth during cooler days. I love that the snap buttons/fasteners are so easy use. They look like plastic white buttons on the outside but regular brass material on inside. I got size Small for my teenage son who’s almost 5’5” in height. It fits him well with still a bit of room for layering a light sweater underneath during colder months. The 2 side pockets fit his hands nicely. This is his first varsity jacket & he loves it!",
