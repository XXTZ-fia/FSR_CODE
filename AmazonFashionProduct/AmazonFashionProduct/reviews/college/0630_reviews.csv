I don’t really have an issue with that, because I would rather a product be reused then thrown in a garbage pile, and the used shirt didn’t smell. Although these shirts are tight, they don’t look bad on, as they have a smooth look. I could see wearing these under something else, or with a particular item, but not as versatile as a regular tank top. I am giving them to my daughter, because I think a younger person would find more opportunities to use them.  Otherwise, I would return them. I’m 45, for reference.",
