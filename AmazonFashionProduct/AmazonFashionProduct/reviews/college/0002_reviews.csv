chris,Designs on shirt are not applied well,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JU9PY124HH98/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9B5Q923,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 3, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"First, I have never read these books BUT my girlfriend absolutely loves this series so I tracked down some ACOTAR merchandise and this shirt made the list. The shirt arrived and I gave it to her straight out of the box cause I love to spoil her and we both immediately noticed that the designs on the shirt were already peeling off, if not totally peeled off. I plan to return the shirt ASAP and order another one to see if it's just a bad apple in the bunch. Check the shirt before you give it as a gift. Was super embarrassing.",
