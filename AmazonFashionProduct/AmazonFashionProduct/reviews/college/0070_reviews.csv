Paul R,Blue stains the white,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TBM89QCWRV37/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDY1BLKY,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Navy Blue,,When the product came in I really enjoyed the look of it.

Sad cause I really liked the jacket.,

This is the first review I'm writing because other reviews mentioned that the material is good, soft, and has a nice feel, which I believe is far from the truth. I hope to leave an honest review to help those considering purchasing this jacket. I was excited when I received the clothing because it was packed in a vacuum-sealed bag, which is usually a sign of high-quality garments. However, as soon as I opened it, I knew something was wrong. A strong unpleasant odor hit me immediately, and the entire jacket was made of artificial fleece material with a very poor texture. It is definitely not the 'Wool Blend' that the product claimed. Although the design is actually quite nice, but the inferior quality of the material is simply unacceptable.",4

I always see these styles on athletes in movies and have always wanted one, but they're never in my size because I'm fat.  Let's talk about the pockets- they're relatively small, but they fit your fist nicely. They are back a bit on the sides of the jacket, but not at a place where it's awkward to have your hands in them.  The collar stays close to the neck, but it's not in a scratchy or uncomfortable way. I LOVE that the sleeves are cinchy and stay taught around my hands. It's really great when I pull them into my palm too, the way women tend to do, as a comfort thing. VERY relaxing.  The arms do get stiff as you cross them, as the material has no give. It's a VERY COMFY jacket, but it still warrants mentioning. The material is pretty stiff and stationary compared to most jackets. I believe it is because this jacket is made to a higher standard and at a higher caliber.  I got the black jacket with black sleeves- mostly because I can't trust myself with white clothes, I'm too accident-prone with food and dirty hands, etc... It is, for me, true to size, as well.  I really, really love this jacket and HIGHLY recommend. I like the show Teen Wolf, so I tell everyone the 'B' stands for Beacon Hills. After one wear, I got at least five compliments.

Not only do they make visually appealing clothing, but the quality is fantastic! I have received fine materials, artisanship, cuts, stitching, and fabric. The aforementioned is vital, as, since the pandemic, I have found the condition of clothing I have purchased to be cheaper than ever, with defects aplenty, no matter how much I pay. I appreciate seeing brands not looking to cut corners but wanting to provide real-value products. If more companies and manufacturers subscribe to this basic philosophy, they will find they create lifetime customers. This jacket not only looks fantastic, it feels and fits incredible. The size I usually wear also seems spot-on with COOFANDY, making ordering simple. No one wants to return online clothing endlessly. Once I find a brand that is this consistent, I stick with them. This Varsity Jacket is a must-have piece to add to your clothing collection at the price point.",3

The colors are very very similar, and I was going to get some Detroit Lions patches and place them on the back and the sleeves to create a look-alike for a costume. The jacket is not as thick as a typical Letterman’s jacket. It’s still a nice jacket, just very thin. Also, I am 6’3” and 250 pounds and I normally wear an XL. I ordered a double XL to make sure I had plenty of room, and the jacket barely fits. It obviously run smaller than normal sizes. And no, I’m not falling for the banana in the tailpipe.",12

The Letter is stitched on the front and the value is perfect. I highly recommend this product. 2 Thumbs up.",
Honesty Blaze,I finally have my letter jacket,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2V13TXH8U8DLZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDY1BLKY,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 21, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: Red,,"I ordered this jacket in red because that was the color of the letter jackets at my high school. I lettered in football and baseball but I never got a letter jacket. Until now.  I also thought that the red might match up with the red of my favorite baseball team, the Boston Red Sox, and since the jacket has a letter B on it that is quite a bit like the Boston Red Sox letter B I thought this would be an ideal jacket for me.  The red on this jacket is lighter than the Boston Red Sox red, it almost has an orangish cast to it, if you know what I mean. But it is close enough to looking like a Red Sox jacket for me so I'm happy with it.  It is well made. It fits a bit more tightly than I expected, I ordered it in a fairly large size and I wish I had gotten even a size bigger because I would prefer some roominess in this type of jacket and I doubt it will stretch out very much. You might consider ordering one size larger than usual. Overall I'm satisfied with it. This will be perfect for autumn wear.",
abelsan76,Nice light jacket…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QPWB87X8AFHF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDY1BLKY,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 19, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: A-black,,"I wa expecting the blend of the material to just be on the sleeves, but it’s all over, which isn’t a bad thing.  It works because it doesn’t necessarily feel like a true bomber jacket, more like an actual letterman jacket.  It’s light enough to wear on a cooler night, but not so heavy that you have to wait for a cold night to cover yourself.  The design is simple, but bold, a couple of colors only that do the design nicely.  Definitely will be something I can wear with jeans or casual pants, and can stand out without being flashy.Recommended for sure, and at a very reasonable price.",

I like the color coordination and it's easy to wear and match with different outfits. It comes in lots of different colors to choose from too. The buttons also button up nicely and is sewn well.,

Ctwink,Very Nice Value Alternative for Bomber/Lettermen Jackets,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MC5T32II6O7J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDY1BLKY,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 17, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Navy Blue,,"The COOFANDY Bomber Jacket is very comfortable, nice soft material, and fits as expected/shown with the bottom of the jacket just about at your belt line. The jacket is closed by metal snaps. The top snap pushes the jacket away from your chest a little so do not expect a snug to your throat fit.  I got the XL and as expected the arms were not long enough for me (I'm 6'6"") but the XXL would have been too large around the waist per the sizing chart. Instead I gave it to my 6'2"" daughter and it fit her arms just fine. I liked the color options and I ended up getting the Navy Blue jacket.  The only issue I have is that you can't change the letter on the chest. I'm sure that this was done to save time at the factory, but not everyone is going to want a jacket with a ""B"" on it. In fact, I bet there are very few.  The $39 purchase price was very economical for what you get.",2
