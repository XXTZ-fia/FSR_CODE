Mom to Many,"Fast Fashion, ok but a bit overpriced for the fabric",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P8YUZKY1UXM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3Y8NH4,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 17, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,,"This blazer suit set is just ok for me. It has a cute look but an odd fit even following the sizing chart. The jacket is very boxy and the arms are very long compared to the rest of the jacket. The jacket is lined.  The skirt has pockets and a button closing in the front. It too is lined, but the pleats are not very sharply creased. It is pretty short and will only work for me if I plan to wear tights with it (I am not tall- 5'4"").  My biggest issue here is the cheap, scratchy polyester fabric. I would expect nicer fabric for something at this price point.",4

Customer review,A decent fast fashion suit set for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34CGYOJWO4GYL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3Y8NH4,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 15, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,,"I was a little disappointed in the fabric of this suit. It's a polyester blend meant to resist wrinkling and creasing, which is all well and good. I can definitely do with less wrinkles. But that means I can't press it and get those nice, crisp seams you like to see in a suit. Also it's not true black. It's off-black, and in some lights, it always looks dusty. That said, it's lightweight, fits true to size, and has a nicely tailored appearance. It's a good suit for looking professional without breaking the bank, that's easy to wash and doesn't always require dry cleaning.",
Dana R. Skvarek II,"Not a great fit, but cute",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R209O9ZNKRQFUT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3Y8NH4,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 14, 2024",Color: Dark GreySize: Small,,"So let's break down both pieces: The skirt first. It's a little odd that the zipper and button are in the front, like a pair of shorts. Why not just turn it around you say? Good question review reader... well because the skirt has pockets. Trust me when I say my wife was beyond stoked to find out about the pockets. But that means the zipper and button, remain up front. Still, the skirt (and underskirt) fit her really well.  On to the jacket top: I have to conclude that the designer was a direct descendent of Gumby or Stretch Armstrong (am I dating myself here?) because the arm of the jacket were just really too long. Both the skirt and jacket were size SM, but the jacket didn't fit my wife right at all. It was a little too big, and that's saying something because she's petite but rather busty. But the arms... they might as well have been elephant trunks.  Overall, very pleased, but not 5-star pleased. 4/5 for this outfit.",7

This fit her really well.  We liked that the shoulder pads in the jacket are light and not overly done.  While I thought the skirt looked really cute on her, she did not think it went with the jacket.  She felt the skirt should have been shorter to go with this jacket.  I personally like skirts to hit my knees but she doesn't.  Overall it was a cute outfit but sadly she'll only be using the jacket.",
Mariel,"Cute and Trendy, But with Some Material Concerns",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BST4SM9J1YIJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3Y8NH4,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 4, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,,"I recently got the EXLURA Women’s Long Sleeve Blazer Suit Set for my teen, and overall, it has been a stylish addition to her wardrobe.  Design and Style: The set is undeniably cute and trendy. The long sleeve blazer paired with the pleated mini skirt offers a chic and fashionable look that perfectly complements tank tops or shirts. The black color is versatile and adds a touch of sophistication, making it suitable for various occasions, from casual outings to more dressy events. My teen loves the overall Y2K fashion vibe of the outfit—it’s right on trend and looks great on her.  Fit and Appearance: The Large size fits well and aligns with the sizing expectations. The blazer has a structured, stylish design that enhances the overall appearance, and the pleated mini skirt adds a playful touch. It’s easy to mix and match the pieces with other items in her wardrobe, which adds to its practicality.  Material and Comfort: While the outfit is visually appealing, there are some concerns regarding the material. The fabric, while not poor quality, can be a bit irritating for my teen. It feels slightly rough and less breathable, which can be uncomfortable, especially if worn for extended periods. This is something to consider if your teen has sensitive skin or if the outfit will be worn frequently.  Functionality and Wearability: Despite the material concerns, the outfit remains functional for various occasions. The blazer and skirt are easy to style and work well with different tops and accessories. It’s a great piece for making a fashion statement, though it’s important to consider the comfort factor when planning for extended wear.  Overall Impressions: In summary, the EXLURA Women’s Long Sleeve Blazer Suit Set is a trendy and cute outfit that looks great on my teen. The design is fashionable, and the pieces work well together or separately. However, the material can be somewhat irritating, which affects overall comfort. It’s a stylish choice but may require some consideration regarding wearability, especially if comfort is a priority. If you’re looking for a chic and on-trend outfit and are willing to manage minor material discomfort, this set could be a great addition to your wardrobe.",6
yada yada yada,Cute set for the price point,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34Y8WTT8S27L0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3Y8NH4,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 1, 2024",Color: BlackSize: X-Large,,"This cropped blazer and pleated mini skirt set is really cute for the price point. I usually wear L in Womens but ordered an XL just to be safe since there weren't any other reviews. It fits slightly oversized but I honestly like that since I don't like my clothes to be clingy anymore. You can stick with your normal size if you want a closer fit. The materials tag says it's made of Terylene but I guess that's just another word for polyester. I ordered it in black so it's harder to tell the material is a bit cheap, it's on par with other fast fashion brands. I do like that the blazer and skirt are both lined. The skirt has pockets which is my favorite feature. I think this would be a good everyday set to wear to work or even a night out with a bustier top.",12
