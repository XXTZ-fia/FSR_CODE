I say that because jackets like this often  have fake leather sleeves. The fake leather looks nice, at first, but from my experience it doesn’t last. It begins to chip away & deteriorate. Accordingly, I prefer the fabric sleeves & they are designed to hold up to a variety of climates & conditions & can be washed normally.",

It is well sewn with quality materials and fully lined.  The outer layer is sweatshirt material and I LOVE that.  It makes it more comfortable and less novelty-looking than if, say, the sleeves were a glossy vinyl.  It would make a fantastic base for a crafting project if you wanted to decorate it with rhinestones, patches, or faux letterman letters.",

I usually opt for a size small, but this time, I wanted a slightly bigger, cropped look. I went with my gut and got a medium, and I couldn't be happier. The fit is exactly what I envisioned, and it proves that there's no wrong or right size – it's all about personal preference. So, whether you want it snug or roomy, this jacket allows you to go crazy and rock your style. The classic varsity design is timeless, and the quality, from stitching to snap closures, is exceptional and went perfect with my backpack.This jacket is a hit, a jackpot in the realm of classic, fun varsity styles. The vintage vibe, accentuated by the attractive, soft material and retro color scheme, makes it a neck breaker. The jacket's durability exceeded expectations, and even when a button needed fixing, it was a simple solution. The Decrum Cropped Varsity Jacket is a fantastic addition, offering comfort, style, and the option to personalize it with patches if you desire. It's a winner in every sense!",

It is soft and not scratchy at all.  The crop is not so short that it defeats the purpose of wearing a jacket.  The colors are vibrant and the coat is well made.  It feels different from an actual letterman jacket in that it is softer and slightly thinner.  This will be super cute on its own or if you wanted to personalize it with patches.  Highly recommend!!,
