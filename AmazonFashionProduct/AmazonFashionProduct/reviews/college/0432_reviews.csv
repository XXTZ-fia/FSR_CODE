I am not happy. I was not expecting superior quality, considering it's made in China. But come come on, really?!?!?!? It was fine at first. But as I used it and wore in,, after about 8 months, the flaws started to show. In the past I have gotten 5+ years out of a purse, if not longer. This isn't even two years.  First the actual item is noticeably smaller than what's shown in the images. Secondly, the shell is decent quality. But more importantly, the fabric used for the lining is cheap and thin. And it's not anchored to the interior of the shell. When I take my keys out of the small front pockets in the front near the bottom, the fabric often comes out with the keys.  A few weeks ago, the lining material jammed in the zipper. I had to cut into the shell with my Dremel tool and a cutting blade to get the lining free of the zipper. And the zipper in one corner of the compartment above it is separating from the shell. And the anti theft pocket in the back is only big enough for a smart phone.  Finally one of the clips that anchors the shoulder strap to the D ring on the shell pulled out from the other half of the mount that allows it to rotate.  Junk!",

This bag exceeded all my expectations, especially for the price point.  It's very sturdy.  The ""leather"" is soft and flexible.  It has a lot of pockets and storage spaces.  The straps are comfortable, well made.  It holds far more than it looks like it should.  In the main compartment I can put my iPad, a Surface laptop, a sketch pad, markers, charge cables and still have room for other stuff, and that doesn't include the front pockets.The zippers are metal and well made.  They slide easily and don't catch.  I did remove the tassel on the front because I thought it was ugly. :)I love the little bag that comes with it.  I don't carry a purse.  I have a small wallet for my license and cards.  I can put that wallet, my phone and a small stash of Advil and carry it shopping or out and the bangle fits my wrist well.My ONLY complaint is that there needs to be a bit more fabric inside because the top of the backpack sinks inward when it has a lot in it because the fabric pulls it in.
