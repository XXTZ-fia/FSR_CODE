I don't know why cloth for men is much better quality than for women. It's oversized as described. My husband gave me my favorite hoodie from his wardrobes in order I would return my purchase back, he didn't like it. I would consider wearing this hoodie during hiking or picnic or while cleaning the house, so I won't worry if it will get dirty. It's my point of view, someone can like it.  I believe this hoodie is overpriced. The delivery was fast, packing was good",
