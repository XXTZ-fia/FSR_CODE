The fabric itself is soft and stretchy. It is so, so comfortable to wear. The fit is perfect. This shirt was made for me in the size small! For reference, I am 5'6"" at 119 lbs. You will need an appropriate bra to wear under the tank, or if you're tiny like me, you can go braless because the fabric does have some support.

Beautiful Design!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R72E2704RJKL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CD26P7B9,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 8, 2023",Size: X-SmallColor: Grayblue,,"For reference, I’m an eccentric Goth that typically wears a teen size S or XS and a 32B bra, I’m 5’4, 115 pounds, and I have the Theatrical Romantic Kibbe body type. I ordered this top in a size XS in the color “Grayblue.” I was a teen in the Y2K era, and I’d say that this top does reflect what you would have found during that time. Even comparing it to some of the tops from then that I still have, it’s very similar.  I love the fit of this top, which clings to all my curves and offers just enough, slight chest compression to give my breasts a small boost when going braless. Luckily, I do have bras meant for this kind of top that won’t stick out anywhere and that produce significant cleavage that looks great with this top; however, most of my bras would not be compatible. If I pull this top all the way down, it sits just over the top of my hip bones, but since I’m significantly wider there than at my much smaller waist, the bottom of this top tends to rise, bunching up closer to my waist, which it defines nicely. This has a wide, sweetheart neckline that exposes a lot of the upper chest. Wide necklines look great on me, so I’m happy about that. If you don’t want the neckline to sit quite so low as it naturally does, then by pulling it up, you might have problems with the shoulder straps falling off, as they’re widely placed and fairly long. The square-cut backline is nice and low; even lower than the neckline. Its positioning aligns with the very bottom of my breasts, and it looks very sexy. Being so low, though, it does, once again, narrow the selection of bras that can be worn with this.  The material is double-layered, so this top isn’t see-thru. Also, the material is incredibly soft and is such a joy to touch and feel all over. It offers a slight amount of stretch and a slight amount of compression that might be able to cinch your waist a bit if you size down. The color I ordered matches that of the product images exactly, so I’m happy about that.  Overall, I’m in love with this absolutely sexy, comfortable, and flattering top!",2
