The jacket is well-made and has a sporty design. But it runs small and is tight at the shoulders, falls short in the back, and the sleeves aren’t long enough, at least for my husband.  It’s a nice lighter-weight coat, but you may want to size up to get a good fit.",

I find this quite small and a medium absolutely would not fit me. I intend on losing a little weight so hopefully it will fit better. That being said I can still wear it and it does button up for me.  The design is very minimalist and modern, but I wouldn't say it's a varsity jacket or lettermen. Maybe a fashionable version of a baseball jacket. The fabric is lightweight but it's also lined. I would say this is a little like a 'shacket'. I would wear this over a t-shirt but with a heavier jacket or coat over it during a colder day or night.  I have paired this with different wardrobe staples and I find that it looks best with a nicely fitting white t-shirt, black or dark grey jeans and a pair of black loafers or chelsea boots.  As others have pointed out, there is no zip, just stud fastenings which can be a little annoying if you are in a hurry and want to close up. Aside from that I really like this jacket and will definitely wear it more.",

This casual lightweight jacket is suitable for a cool September afternoon, and you could add additional layers for colder weather. I plan to use it as a warm-up jacket when playing tennis outdoors this fall.  In the olden days, letterman’s jackets were made of wool with leather arms. This 2020s version is 92% polyester and 8% spandex, and the spandex gives it lots of stretch. In the text on the Amazon website, the Chinese manufacturer refers to the jacket as a “bomber jacket windbreaker.” I have my doubts about this windbreaking claim but haven’t had a chance to test the jacket outdoors, since it’s still summer.  Like most letterman’s jackets, this garment has a snap front (6 snaps). It has a ribbed collar, cuffs and hem.  Many -- perhaps most -- jackets today have a separate pocket for a cell phone. This varsity jacket has two deep slash pockets for your hands but no other pockets.  Though the text on the Amazon site says “hand washes,” the tag on the jacket says it’s OK to machine wash but “do not tumble dry.”  As far as size goes, I’m 5’10” and 160, and the Large fit me perfectly.  ###",

I ordered dark grey in xxl for my husband and he really likes this jacket but it's definitely not a bomber jacket. It's really nice and soft material. It snaps up rather than zips up. Fits him great so it is true to size. But the sleeves could be a little bit longer. When you stretch out your arms the sleeves are very short. The product description is not at all what I received. For it to match the description it's gotta be made out of the correct kinds of materials and colors and it has to have a zipper. This jacket is good for spring and fall. But it is nice and nice looking on also. It's worth the money it's just definitely not a bomber jacket but I do recommend if you want a nice, comfy, soft jacket.",
