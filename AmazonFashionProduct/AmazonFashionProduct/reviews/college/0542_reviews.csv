In this case it was spot on. I ordered the XL  and at 5'5"" and 155#s the fit is just barely oversize. I plan on taking it backpacking and wearing it on the plane. I have a packable down to wear under it if need be. I hate when the hoods are so large they fall in your eyes. This hood does not. The jacket seems to be made ok for the price. The only flaw is it does not have a rain flap for the zipper so rain will absolutely get in there. If it does rain I will have a poncho over everything so for my purpose it is not an issue. It just seems kind of regretful to not install a rain flap on a rain coat zipper.05/20/24 UPDATE:  There are not vents anywhere on the jacket. The result being it becomes hot very quickly when worn even in cool weather. No one could possibly use it for a running jacket or any physically demanding actions. Just walking in 50 degree weather causes a sauna like atmosphere inside the coat. It seems to be waterproof but with no ventilation it causes sweating quite quickly.",2
