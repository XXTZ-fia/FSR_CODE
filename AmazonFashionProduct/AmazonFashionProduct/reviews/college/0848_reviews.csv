I always buy an inexpensive backpack on Amazon and use it for about 2 years before they need to be replaced.  So far this one is my favorite.  The laptop section is squishy enough to support the laptop which is one of important features to me.  I also love the second zipper with extra pockets for my other supplies.  The only negative is that the straps that tighten aren’t resistant enough to loosening so I have to tighten them every time I put it in.  Still not worth switching.  I love the colors of this bag too.,3
