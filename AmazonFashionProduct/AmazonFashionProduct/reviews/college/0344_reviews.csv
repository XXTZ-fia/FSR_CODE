Yoooangela,Very comfortable and cool,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IX02YF0R5C9A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2X7W13Y,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Size: SmallColor: YellowNumber of Items: 1,Verified Purchase,The jumper is very nice. It fits perfectly in a size small. A little long but not too bad in a pair of heels. I’m 5’5 and it’s a tad bit long on me.  But I threw on a pair of heels and that fixed the length issue. It’s tall girl friendly for sure. The color is as pictured. The jumper came without the buttons to snap the neck closed. That’s the only way to keep the jumper up and the snaps/buttons were missing. See attached pics. It’s unwearable without the buttons. So I’m not sure what to do. I need the jumper for an upcoming event. A bit of an inconvenience but would still recommend this jumper as it might just be an isolated case. I messaged the seller but haven’t heard back. Hopefully they will ship me the buttons or a total replacement.,
Z,Enormous,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6K5D41OPVST6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2X7W13Y,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2025",Size: MediumColor: BlackNumber of Items: 1,Verified Purchase,"This jumpsuit was HUGE. Purchased in size medium -I am 5'7"" and 142lbs. I feel like I could have fit 2 of me in this. It was more than just ""flowy"" it was like I was wearing a set of drapes. It was also several inches too long so I'd say the medium seemed like it would fit someone 5'11 / size 10 or so. I guess I have a linebacker neck because that was the only part that fit well. The fabric is a static prone polyester chiffon so if you wear this in winter you better carry some static guard at all times or this outfit will attach to you like a clingy toddler. Consider yourself warned.",

The lining is 4-6” shorter than the top layer which may be a problem for some but worked perfectly for me. The white looks like a true white in the pictures but is actually slightly cool tone. It’s very comfortable but it can get hot if you’re moving a lot since it’s polyester. I didn’t have a problem with fabric transparency but I always wear seamless nude undergarments for this type of thing anyway.

The fit and flow was awesome! I am a bit conservative and prefer undergarments to not show through my outfits. Make certain that you have a full halter undergarment as the shorter leg will show through. I paired my jumpsuit with a sheer tulle to serve as a shawl and definitely enhanced the look. I am short so the length (inseam) is long. So, if you wear heels, it should fall at a good point. Neck was fine, however, it was a little tussle to connect/stretch the elastic closure. Also, don't have oil or lotions that have a residue on your hands as it will definitely show on the chiffon like material. Overall great buy!",

I am one of those “saggy girls” women so I HAD to get a sports bra to go with it, but it totally works and is a low cross-back so it looks like it’s part of the original jumpsuit and I feel supported! Plus! Only slight bummer is that the torso feels short. It’s not so much that the garment is uncomfortable, but I can see it getting a little more noticeable as the wearing progresses. I plan to use shapewear shorts which will, hopefully, mitigate this just a little bit. Fingers crossed. Again, not so noticeable that I wouldn’t wear it. The photo gave me the impression the legs were super long, so I was looking for wedges to wear with it. The legs aren’t as long as I thought, but I don’t think I would be able to do flats or sandals. Still might go with the wedge sandals idea just because I think it will look so cute! Don’t forget to make time to steam it first before wearing. All in all, a really great buy.",7
