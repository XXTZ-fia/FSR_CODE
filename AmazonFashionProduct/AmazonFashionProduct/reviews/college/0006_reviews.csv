The many compartments make it fun to use, with an accessible compartment on the back for the security of passports or other items. It came in many colors, mine is navy blue to match my luggage. I worried about the zipper, but it endured. The light color suggests being careful about where you put it to keep it clean.",

Brianna Crotty,"2nd time buyer - couldn't ask for better (this time I'll keep it away from teething puppies, though)",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ALVNRKMV0CJI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCY3ZK2L,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 19, 2024",Size: 17 InchColor: Beige-black-brown,Verified Purchase,"I’m re-purchasing this backpack not because it wore out from daily use, but because my teething pup gave it a little too much love! After nearly two years of consistent, everyday use, the backpack was still in great shape and felt practically new - other than the tooth marks on the main zipper and top handles last February (9 months ago).  Remarkably, the zipper held up until just last week, and the top handles never tore, even after months of residual puppy damage. That durability speaks volumes. This backpack outlasted most of my sneakers!  I recently used the ""hidden"" zipper pocket for my passport during a trip to Mexico, which was incredibly convenient, and I felt really safe because I knew my documents were safe and close by. Unfortunately, the combined wear and tear of daily use and puppy adventures finally caught up with it. (My dog is lucky she’s cute.)  I’m reordering this bag because:  1 - It’s proven to be incredibly durable. It'd probably last 10 years if I'd kept it safe from puppy teeth. 2 - It’s stylish. I’m not trendy by any means, but I get compliments on it all the time. (Maybe I should reconsider other parts of my wardrobe, though!) 3 - It has so many pockets, and let’s be honest, complaining about too many pockets is a pretty good problem to have.  All in all, this backpack has been a total win.",3

Though, I dont see how it is anti theft (?). I use this for college and it does the job. Not too heavy either. Though I was in the rain and it got pretty soaked, it dried well but am not convinced that it is either water resistant or waterproof. The good thing is it did not go through onto my laptop or ipad so it seems decently durable. The price is okay its not expensive though its a pretty average backpack overall and nothing special.",
