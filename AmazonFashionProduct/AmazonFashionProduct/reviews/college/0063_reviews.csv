susan denault,"good shirt , but really runs small",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CLXKEH1EJOO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07PYCSZXS,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 3, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"It's so impossible nowadays to know how a shirt will run...some are HUGE at this size, and some are way too small.  Size charts don't seem adequate or correct. Maybe Amazon can look into this?",
Tracy,"Great message, OK quality",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CKM5JFVQ46GK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07PYCSZXS,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 13, 2022",,Verified Purchase,"I love the message. I was hoping for better quality. The shirt itself is of lesser quality, and the screen print doesn't look centered. However, it could be just how it fits me personally. Regardless, I still will enjoy wearing it to spark conversation.",
