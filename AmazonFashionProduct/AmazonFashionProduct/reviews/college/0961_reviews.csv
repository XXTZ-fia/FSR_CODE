SLR,Very nice sweatshirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HRD01WWANTKL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2HTRWP4,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 26, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,This hoodie came in a vacuumed sealed package so the packaging material was minimal.

The pink color is very pretty, and there are areas on the sweatshirt that show the acid wash.  There are little wear holes along the hood and around the hem on the bottom.  I am a size 10 and I took a medium.  It is a great fit, definitely loose.  If I wanted an even sloppier look (I know that is the wrong word to use), I could even have sized up one more size.  The medium is great though, the sleeves are long enough and that is really what matters to me.  As someone else said, the neck hole is a bit tight.  It doesn't bother me, but I have to tug a bit to get it over my head.  I may take a scissors and slit an opening to make it bigger.  The best thing about this sweatshirt though is the feel of it.
