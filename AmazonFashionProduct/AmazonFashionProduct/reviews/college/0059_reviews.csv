Please know it runs big.  I normally wear a large but that size was huge so exchanged for a medium.  It is a sweatshirt style, but the material is not what a true sweatshirt is made from.  The fabric is dressier, a bit thin for a sweatshirt (but the white is not transparent) and the pleat in the back adds nice style.  It has a bit of a tendency to ride up, but that seems to have improved since it was laundered.  I’ve given 4 stars due to the misleading description, since I was expecting a traditional sweatshirt.  But I’ve kept the shirt because it really is a nice top, and a step up from a sweatshirt.",

First off, the fabric quality is really good. It feels lightweight and soft against the skin, which is perfect for layering in the cooler months. The material doesn’t seem cheap or flimsy, and I really like that. The sweatshirt has a nice, casual vibe that caught my eye, and I can see how it could be a cute addition to many outfits.  However, the fit is where this top fell short for me. I found it to be quite cropped—more so than I anticipated. For someone who usually prefers a more traditional length in sweatshirts, this one didn't sit comfortably at all. The boxy silhouette adds to the problem; while boxy can sometimes work in favor of a trendy look, in this case, it made me feel a bit like I was drowning in fabric, especially around the torso. The shape just didn’t flatter my figure as I had hoped.  While I think this top is cute and could absolutely work for those who enjoy the cropped style, it ultimately wasn’t for me. The fit felt a bit off, and I can't see myself reaching for it regularly. However, I wouldn't say the sweatshirt is a complete miss; it might work out better for someone who loves a boxy, cropped style and wants something casual yet stylish.",

The cut of the draped shoulders into the timeless batwing makes it roomy on top. I particularly like the pleat on the back = more room to give hugs. But then the sweater tapers to the waist, giving form and a look of style. That’s why I’m surprised I like the crop top; it gives the pullover class.  I wouldn’t necessarily wear it for working out or playing ball (observing, yes, playing, no), but going to the office, store or casually getting together with friends, its ideal. It’s much lighter and more comfortable than I expected, given that it’s 100% polyester. Wearing it in late summer as a shawl to start, then as a sweater as the air cools should be great. As the colder temperatures roll around, it’ll be handy as an attractive layer for the season. My one complaint is the stripes aren’t a perfect match on the sides and inner arm. On mine, they were slightly askew. I don’t think anyone would notice, but I did.  In all, I think it’s a fashionable addition to my wardrobe making me a happy contradiction.",6
