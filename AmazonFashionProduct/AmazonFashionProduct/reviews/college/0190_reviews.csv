Emilie S.,A cute and durable backpack,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BA51N7SBZB4M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRGNJRT5,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 19, 2024",Color: Color 07Size: Small,Verified Purchase,"The pattern I chose is really cute, and has lots of pockets and storage. Very comfortable to take around everywhere. The only reason I take away a star is because the color of the backpack is pink, and not purple like it is shown in the product image. The only reason I went for this design is because I thought it would be purple, not pink.  But other than that, it's great quality for the money and I'm keeping it for everyday use!",

It sits on my back nicely and has a great amount of zippers and pockets. Material feels very strong. I was impressed with the pattern in person! There is a nice Zipper on the back of the backpack which is not only extra storage but could be used to keep money or valuables secure.,

Trinity,Honestly in Love,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RW1VIKSRR0S6O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRGNJRT5,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 19, 2024",Color: Color 23Size: Medium,Verified Purchase,"This bag has been a lifesaver for me! I am a 5’3” woman and sometimes “normal” sized bags for adults are too big for me and cause constant back issues. However I have a 11.5in Chromebook and decided to give this bag a try since it was considerably smaller by about 5” from the Larger size. And I have ZERO regrets. The bag has great quality stitching, it didn’t stink when it came in, the zippers had plastic wrap on them so they arrived pristinely, smoothly , and scratch free. I also have long hair and I keep my zippers met at the middle top of the main bag and it has never once gotten caught! I love the quilted design for the extra flare, but honestly it is so soft like an actual quilted blanket! The only complaint I have is the straps do fall throughout the day, so you have to readjust them frequently but I’m also forsaken with a larger chest and like to tuck my thumbs under the straps, fingers wrapped around the front of straps, with my elbows tucked in so I could honestly be unconsciously pulling them down. I will take pictures with my bag on so it can hopefully help other women contemplating on if a smaller bag can help them with similar issues!",2
Chris Hjelm,Love the design,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R373YT2T1Z1JV8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRGNJRT5,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 18, 2024",Color: Color 08Size: Small,Verified Purchase,"I love the design of this backpack, but the straps do not stay tightened. It’s annoying having to retighten the straps every time you use the backpack, but other than that it’s good. It has lots of pockets. It’s a little flimsy at times when you don’t have a lot in it but other than that the durability is pretty good.",
