I needed a new bag (purse) and I like backpacks so I decided to try this. Its way bigger than any other backpack bags I've carried in the past so it might be too big for some people for the daily use. However I love that it can fit a lot in there.  When I got it my first thought was hmm maybe I could use it as a diaper bag and for sure as a overnight bag because of the size. Overall if your on the fence about it just go ahead and buy it its a great quality!,

Something with a cleaner look as I've outgrew my old one. I had ordered the model showed in picture in the color beige-brown, size 15. However, upon further discovery once I received my item, the title of the item had not matched the cart description at all and I was sent an entirely different backpack (design and all) in size 17. No powerbank port and no pencil case included as promised. This was a huge disappointment and I was about to return the item, but with the holidays and just because the bag ended up looking cute either way, I think I'll keep it. The extra space will probably do me some good too as a college student, so I suppose this wasn't too bad. They did get the beige-brown color part right so I suppose congratulations is in order. However, if I was to return this and order a new one, I won't see the item until at least January when school have already restart, so I don't know. Perhaps I'll change my mind later, but I do just want to put this out there. I tried checking size 15 in all the other colors too but same thing in that item title name does not match cart description, and I'm not sure if ordering will result in this same mishap.  TLDR: The bag is cute either way. I don't miss the powerbank too much as I never used that feature anyway in my old backpack but man I do wish I did receive that pencil case. Deciding to keep FOR NOW, but I am an indecisive person. Just overall a little confused.",

I was caught in a rainstorm and some water leaked into the bags where my laptop was placed and it got some water on it luckily no damage.
