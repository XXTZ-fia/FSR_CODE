In order to accommodate my hips I had to go up several sizes making the top waaaay too large!  Something else to keep in mind is that this is a heavier material so you might be hot on top and cold in the legs d/t the shorts.",2

The fabric is a nice thickness. It's not super thin. I tried on the pullover jacket and it was warm and comfortable. The sizing is generous- you can order your normal clothing size without any worries! The sleeves go all the way down to my wrists, as well. (Being a taller woman, sometimes this is not the case!) I thought the jacket looked like a cropped jacket, but it did go down to the top of my hip, and not mid-waist. I was pleased about that! Bonus: The jacket also has pockets!! The shorts are just as generously sized and comfortable. I chose to get the apricot color and it looks just as nice in person as it did on the site. This is an outfit that I can see myself wearing often in the spring, and any time I am going to the gym. I may order another set in a different color, because I like it so much!",2

As always when ordering clothing items from Amazon, I’ve found that following the size chart is best. With so many brands from manufacturers to be found, it helps to avoid disappointment and less returns. Normally I’m a small in items such as this. Because the sizing for the shorts puts me at a Medium with the top being Small. I chose to size up for best fit. Happy to say it worked out perfect, a little oversized in a good way. Casual and sporty look. Super cute with a pair of sneakers or sandals. Mid weight design makes for all season wear. Well constructed with no sloppy loose threads. Washes well, comes out of the dryer wrinkle free. Great value for a nice quality set I feel will last for some time.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review. I do my best to share areas that are of importance to me. Hope I’ve been somewhat helpful to you. All thoughts are my own, not influenced in any way. Enjoy and Happy Shopping!",

(maybe a hind more muted but barely)  I got an XL in hopes that the top would be a big less cropped and it was.  My only downside was that I would have liked more stretch overall in the top.  It has very little stretch when getting it on and off.  If you are super tiny this might not be an issue, but getting these over 38DD's was not as comfortable as I would have preferred.  I still really like this outfit, although personally I plan to wear them separately.  (not a short and hoodie type person)  The shorts were comfortable lounge wear for me.  I wore the top over jeans and it looked really cute and hit just below my waist but rises if you raise your arms.",

I was worried it would be bulky but the thickness of the material isn’t as heavy as pictures make it look. I’m 5’4 185 lbs and wear between 10-12 in clothing. I decided to go with the large instead of x-large based on the chart and I’m losing weight. It’s more fitted to my body because of this. So I would size up if you’re in between clothing sizes and want a loose fit; size down if you want it snug. Two things I’m not thrilled about: the top seems more like a crop top than hip/oversized and the crotch area of the shorts is a little long on me even after I pull them up to close up the space with the top.,
