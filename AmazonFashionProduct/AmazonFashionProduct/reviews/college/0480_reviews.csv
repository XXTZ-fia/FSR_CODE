Like the different compartments, more pen holder pockets and deeper or more secure elastic on cup holder side pockets would be nice as bottles fall out easily. Chest strap and top zippered pocket for small stuff would also be a good addition. Gets heavy.",

But a large issue i’ve had is the minimal cushioning on the bottom of the bag and the small water bottle pouches. Just about everytime i put my bag on or put it on my owala falls out. It’s fallen so much it broke 🥲 So if you’re a water bottle person definitely get deeper pockets.,

Also, the sewn on logo is completely black, so it looks more professional than in the pics. Lining is way better quality than in cheap bags. Pockets are smart—placed in just the right spots.

This backpack has several compartments that has one zipper but the larger compartments(3) for laptop and others are lockable with a mini-lock.  The material of the zippers were good and doesn't show signs that it could fail in the future.  The canvas is medium strenght which is good compromise between durability and weight.
