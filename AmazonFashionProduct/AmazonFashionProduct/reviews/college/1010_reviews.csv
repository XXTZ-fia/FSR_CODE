Rivendell,"oversized, great material and design",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MUCVAYXTPIZY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8HXHD18,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 11, 2024",Color: Charcoal Gray-hawaiiSize: Large,,"This is an oversized style sweatshirt, so if you normally wear size L and would like to have an oversized look, stay with your regular size L. Inside is a very soft fleece and medium to thick material. The embroidery is well done and is not scratchy inside at all, it can be worn straight on the bare skin. I love everything about this sweatshirt. It arrived in a vacuum bag and naturally the first look was not the best but after putting it in the dryer it looked fabulous. Highly recommended.",

The Trendy Mom,IN LOVE!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37U89K1904TQY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8HXHD18,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 7, 2024",Color: Light Coffee-parisSize: Large,,"Two words about this sweatshirt: GET IT!! This is my favorite new top in a while. Fit is fantastic; super slimming and flattering. Fit is roomy and generous while still maintaining a cute shape and structure! Currently in between a L and XL. I have a super large chest, carry some weight in my belly, and have a long torso, and I wanted to be able to wear this with leggings. I took a chance on the size L and it's working well for me! So I think this runs a smidge big. I'm so glad I went with the light coffee color because it's so soft and pretty. The letters are actually embroidered onto the sweatshirt, so no chance of them falling off! Truly amazing quality. I couldn't be more satisfied!!",2
