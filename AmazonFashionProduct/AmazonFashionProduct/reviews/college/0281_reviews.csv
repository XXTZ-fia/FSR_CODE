The-look and feel of the material is very close to lulu. I’ve been asked countless times if my shirt is a lulu brand and every time i’m asked to show them where i bought them. I do wish they made one though that wasn’t as low cut. Just because i’m large chested and wish the shirt covered them just a little bit more but besides that love love them!!,

I just assumed that the sizing would be the same for all of Suuksess tops, but not in this case. I bought my usual XS which has fit me great. But not so this time - I tried it on and I could barely get it on! The XS in this top was sooooo small, I'm really not sure who it would fit except perhaps a child. However, the color is beautiful and it also is extremely soft (as with the other tops purchased). I only wish I could wear it. Shipping was great too. Now I'm wary of ordering from this company again.",

Chelsey,Make sure you check the size chart,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SFH9ESNK15NY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB7M38SH,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 27, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Marsala,Verified Purchase,"Amazon recommended an XL, which is usually my size in most brands. I should have checked the size chart, because for this brand an extra large runs extremely small compared to an objective scale. The shirt is a nice quality and color. I wish I could size up, but ""XL"" is the biggest size they carry. Always sad when brands fail to be inclusive. You'd think they'd at least care from a business perspective. 7/10 people in the US are a size 14 or above. Excluding fat people means excluding like 70% of the sales pool in a huuuge country. How can you hate fat people more than you love money?",6

There is some stretch but I def won’t need to wear a bra with this since it’s super compressed. I personally don’t have an issue with the compression but someone else might. I would get a small next time in this brand. If you’re familiar with mango pop the fabric is like those double lined basics they have which I freaking love. This is a good basic shirt and it’s not see through but material is still thin so wear pasties on those colder days,10
