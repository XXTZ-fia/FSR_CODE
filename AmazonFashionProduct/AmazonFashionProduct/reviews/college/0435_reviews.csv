anne christenson,"TINY, but cute. Exchanging for a MUCH larger size.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R54U9XH1CY1NR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLWRQ4D4,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2025",Size: 3X-LargeColor: I#camouflage,Verified Purchase,"I ordered my standard size, women's XL, but the sweater is tiny... Like middle schooler TINY. The quality and color are good, but it wouldn't even fit my 10-year old niece. I am returning (minus the shipping fee - grr) and reordering a 4XL as I will need a layer underneath. I have never ordered anything above a 2XL in my life, but the sweater is cute. Crossing my fingers. 🤞",
V.

I got the silver which should have fox faces around the neck. It’s an attractive design, but you can’t tell what it’s supposed to be. Asian sizing; I ordered a 5X and it is an 1X/2X in American sizes.",
Sue Brockman,Nordic sweater,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFWRMLS9MP92W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLWRQ4D4,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2025",Size: MediumColor: L#yellow,Verified Purchase,Very stylish and love warm colors with complementary colors  Lightweight wool.

Evening Iris,Snug Fit But Great,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1M9N90GIMK00/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLWRQ4D4,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: N#gn1,Verified Purchase,"I was very apprehensive about getting this sweater. It came in directly from China, and they like to sell us their out-takes and rejects for full price. Anyway, it came today and I found it to be surprisingly nice: very substantial with good quality yarn; not thin at all. This is a great knock-about sweater for winter warmth. You could wear this with jeans for raking leaves, grocery shopping, studying for school, or hobbies like watercolor painting.  It is 100% polyester and is lovely to the touch; not scratchy. The directions say dry clean but maybe you could hand wash with Castille liquid soap, and hand block it. The main body color is an army green with black, Egyptian blue, some medium gray, and florettes of kaki. This is a boatneck sweater that doesn't really have a designated back or front. My only complaint is the fit. I usually wear a 1x, but given Asian sizing, I ordered a 2x and it is still a close fit, but not uncomfortable. Also, I believe it will stretch out a bit with wear and use. It you want or need a good workhorse knock about winter sweater and order a size or two up, depending on how loose you like your clothing, this is a good option. I plan on wearing this a lot.",3
Tuckybird,Runs very small but it is beautiful,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QZWI7850SBA0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLWRQ4D4,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Size: 4X-LargeColor: K#hot Pink,Verified Purchase,Soooo pretty but I suggest buying two sizes larger than what you wear.,

John McCarthy,Not exactly as pictured but surprisingly nice,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R340WJ8SQBFXS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLWRQ4D4,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: 3X-LargeColor: A#grey,Verified Purchase,The sweater pictured had a looser knit with some fuzziness to it. The sweater that arrived was not fuzzy and a tighter knit. That said the color block was gorgeous and cut of the sweater was very flattering. It looks more expensive than it is and while the knit is not cotton it feels pretty good. I would recommend.  I ordered a 3X and I would say it fit like a US L,2
