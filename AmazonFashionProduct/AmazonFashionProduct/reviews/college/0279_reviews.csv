The big bag comes with a corduroy strap that feels sturdier and looks prettier and it comes with a hard sheet that sits at the bottom so it has more structure. The small bag, although a more convenient size for my everyday needs, comes with a very simple woven strap and no hard bottom so it loses all structural integrity. Not sure why these cheaper changes were made for the smaller version but it definitely reduces likeability. However, I'm going to keep it cause for right now it suits what I need and it can fit my water bottle, and umbrella, my wallet, and a book.",15
