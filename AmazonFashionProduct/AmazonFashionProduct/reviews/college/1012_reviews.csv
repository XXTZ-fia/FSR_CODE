It's sturdy, durable, and huge inside pockets. You can adjust the straps. The color is beautiful.  I would recommend this to anyone who carries extra stuff in your purse and who prefer the backpack style. The price was great, and it helps keep everything I have organized. No issues with zippers breaking or straps breaking. Im super impressed and will most likely be buying another one when I need to replace mine.",

This bag is beautiful, made well, fully lined, seems sturdy, and comfortable. I really did go back and forth and almost kept both bags but ultimately decided to return this solely based on its size. I was primarily looking for a personal item to carry on a plane and this was close to being perfect just went with a different one from the same company. Still highly recommend",

I especially love the back belt to slide over the luggage handle to give your back a break.  The inside and outside bottle pockets are also nice and roomy for larger bottles.
