CGK,"Elegant, fun & classy!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13S3A71UO8970/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49T551S,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Navy,,"Like many of you, skeptical as style different but that’s what made this so appealing. Also dress up or down easy. I wore with suede brown over knee boots for fundraising event. Added some turquoise long earrings for pop of color. Color rust not orange. I wore with silicone sticky breast inserts (hate half bras!) and the one shoulder is cut in near the neck which is a cool addition. Washed in lingerie bag on delicate and hung up to dry. No issue. One challenge is the wrinkles and I used iron on delicate setting & for the cowl neck I had to take off ironing board and hold in my hand to prevent creasing. Give yourself extra time for that! It does hug you in hips and I cut one of my slips (DIY in last minute necessity lol) to be short enough under dress and that worked perfect - no more ride up or static cling. I received MANY compliments. You’ll be the only one wearing this gem. (for reference: I’m 5’ 4” 137 lb 36D)",

The dress is very frumpy and it’s easy to get lost in the fabric. Not super stretchy tbh the wrap tie could go tighter on my body. Def more of a summer option cuz it wouldn’t be warm at all in the winter. The dress is cut pretty dang short, which is cute, but not exactly the look I’m going for. As a tall girl, everything is short on me. Don’t need this one to do that too. Quality is comparable to like high school homecoming, if that",
