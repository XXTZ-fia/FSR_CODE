However the top, even with though it was a bit stretchy was uncomfortably too tight for me.  I had washed it gentle cycle cold water.  I couldn't figure out what the drying instructions indicated... a box with a straight line in it. Even Google couldn't help me. So I took a chance and set the dryer for 10 minutes on the lowest heat setting.  Was that why the top was so tight? Also the skirt part of the dress was too long for my taste.  I asked our local very talented seamstress to shorten the dress.  I didn't want to lose the scalloped edge.  So I wanted to shorten the dress at the waist.  The seamstress, who used to work with a shirring machine in a clothes factory refused to separate the top and bottom pieces of the dress.  She said by cutting the shirring away to shorten the dress the new shirring edge would never fit properly again. So I bought a medium. case closed.",9
