I'm a 36DDD (45"" around bust). 40"" around my Waist & Tummy area. I typically order XL in everything to be comfy and give room, but decided to go down a size to a L, hoping it'd fit & be right at my hip, which it is! The length of this stops right above the booty. I still have a good amount of room, it zips up all the way and feels good & thick. Puffy yes, but nothing too crazy yet it doesn't get flat either. I tried it on with a hoodie & a long sleeve fitted shirt & the vest fit great when wearing both. Very happy with the Vests I got and look forward to getting some other colors soon, like the Grey, White, Blue & Brown (heard that's more on the Rust Color side).",

This is lightweight but keeps your warm without the huge bulk. There are pockets on each side and a draw cord if.you want to tighten the bottom. Don't sleep on these! The price is only one of the many amazing reasons to purchase! Oh no smell!,2

However, with the vest on, others can't really see that.  While missing filling won't keep you warm in cold winter weather, the vest kept me warm in cool fall weather.  I assume any replacements of the same vest would also not be made to expectations, so, I kept this vest -- it's fine, not fabulous.  Before purchase, I liked that it only cost $37.00, but because of the missing filling, it should have been priced in the $20s.",
