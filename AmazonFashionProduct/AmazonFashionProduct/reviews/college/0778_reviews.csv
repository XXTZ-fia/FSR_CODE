Redcoat Rebel,"A really simple, cute, and feminine top that works well with a lot of outfits.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10MS6GD6KFXQU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DQ8HC3Q1,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 26, 2025",Color: WhiteSize: Medium,,"My wife ordered this top for the purpose of going on under her strappy dresses and to provide some modesty, while also, adding a little small amount of feninine lace and frilliness. She may also decide to war it with her denime jacket and mini-skirt too. Either way, the look will be perfect.  This top worked out perfectly for her. This simple lace-edged top fit her perfectly and is made from a very soft material. So it is extremely comfortable, when worn, The lace is subtle and not too over the top. A little around the neck line on show and if worn on top, a beautiful wider, softer lace, around the hem. The quality of the needle work is excellent.  Price wise? This will be a personal thing. For such a small basic top, some may say that this is a little pricey. My wife just tells me it is perfect for what she wants it for and so price comes second to the style and quality.  She loves this simple, cute, and feminine top.",
