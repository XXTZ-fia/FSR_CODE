What a beautiful bag! Awesome color, me dark red. Much more elegant looking than most backpacks without it being an actual small more purse like backpack. Looks extremely durable and I have no doubt about it being water ""resistant""  I just put my stuff in this bag and am headed for the airport. So I have not really put it to the test yet. But what I will tell you is that it appears to be a great electronic backpack as it is totally padded out! Great for a small laptop, ipad, small external speaker ect. A lot if pros with this bag! If you're useing it for that. Could make a good utility or camera bag too.  The cons... It weights 2 Lbs. empty so that's extra weight you have to carry. Also the top outside pocket only has one zipper going in one direction. Two zippers would be better as you could shackle them together with a small mountain climbing hook or something because it is not an anti theft proof pocket and I would never advise putting your phone or anything else of value in it if you are useing it to travel with! I travel all the time and have had two phones and a small speak stolen already! And, on three separate occasions!!!  Another thing is I wish it had more inside pockets. An additional zipper pocket inside for tiny items like cosmetics would have been great. There are only two small ultra thin pockets and a couple of pen pockets in the larger portion of the bag's compartment, which is excellent for my eyeglasses and the other my sunglasses. I have always struggled without this feature in other bags. Both glasses are always on and off, on and off. So putting them in and out of case's and digging around for them has been a real pain and they always end up getting scratched. This feature solves that problem!  It would also be nice to see an anti theft pocket for a wallet and passport in the back of the bag too.  They company should think about making umbrellas out of the same fabric to match too. Just a thought.  All the way around it is still a great electronics bag. I just wish I had bought a bigger size as I use it in my travels to grocery shop too.  I just want to put a shout out to the person who personalized their bag wit the patches. Great idea for identification if every lost or stolen!👍 Besides, I like the idea of self expression!  Love the bag!!!",6

My previous backpack (free from work!) was in tatters, so I made a list of priorities and shopped Amazon mid-flight.  I wanted: - Backpack design (hands-free!) - side pocket big enough for a water bottle - fits under an airline seat (no checked bags!) - square so that it maximizes all the corner space - Zippered large central compartment to fit a compressed packing cube or two - Zippered outer pockets (easily accessible) for books, chargers, sundries. Must fit books.  This has all of that AND MORE, like a latch on the main zipper so people can't teach in when I'm obliviously wandering through airports. It has a little interior pocket for a power source(not included) so you can charge your phone from your backpack. I like the way it looks.  Plus, I wandered all over a city in the rain with it. It's small enough that it can pass as a day bag, and my things inside didn't get wet, even books.  It's exactly perfect for me. Your mileage may vary, depending on your needs.",
