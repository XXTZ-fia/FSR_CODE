Amy Fanning,Good quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PHCPLI4RY7U2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01M0QNAZV,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 2, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Navy,Verified Purchase,"The hoodie is very comfortable and good material. I normally wear a small in men’s hoodies, so I ordered a small but it’s a tad tight. So maybe go up one size just in case because they do seem to run a little bit small.",
VE,Sleeves are too short and the large fits like a small!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSGLT4052B07Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01M0QNAZV,"1.0 "," the United States "," May 2, 2022",Size: LargeColor: Navy,Verified Purchase,Not what I expected...this sweatshirt seems like it was put in the dryer on high heat and shrunk. Sleeves fit like a Pee Wee Herman suit. Very disappointed in this purchase and will not buy from them again.,

Randi Sequeira,"Awesome product. A little tight in the neck, but amazingly comfy.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R83RJ1NVTZJ9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01M0QNAZV,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 17, 2021",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Great hoodie. A little tight around the neck for my taste, and I have a skinny neck, but that’s pretty typical for pullovers. It just might be something someone would wanna know if they’re not a fan of hoodies that cling tightly around the neck. It’s very soft and well shaped, though and I love it! It’s my new fav hoodie.",

Its Gilden so that describes the quality and size. (If you dont know its a little smaller for taller people and isnt high quality but most merch and stuff uses Gildan brand) I wouldnt wash it in hot water. Mine also got a small rip on the arm i didn’t realize at first but that might not be their fault could be the wearhouses.,

It is a ""college prep"" school, so they allow sweatshirts with college logos.  He couldn't decide on a university he wanted one from, so I bought him this one.  It was a big hit among his friends and it took weeks before the teachers even noticed that it was a joke. Since it was in good taste, they let it slide and it has become his favorite sweatshirt.  Hah!!  Love it!",2
