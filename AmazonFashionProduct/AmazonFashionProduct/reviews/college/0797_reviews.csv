Customer Review,Love it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BQY253KKLYRB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK9LPMH8,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: Dark Green PinkSize: Small,,"Okay, so I actually got this shirt because it reminds me of my youth (something I'd have worn in high school in the early 90s).  I love it.  It's soft.  It's cotton and spandex (my fave combo).  It's cute.  What more can I ask for.  I'm 5'6"", about 150, 34D (VS), 27/28 in jeans, 40-inch hips, and an hourglass.  I got a small.  It fits a bit oversized, as described.",
Lisa,Cute and comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R378P6MZ26LPSF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK9LPMH8,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: Dark Green ApricotSize: X-Large,,"This tshirt is very comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. Oversized look, I ordered an extra large and probably could have worn a large. For reference I'm 5'6 and 180 pounds. Love the colors they are very vibrant. Cute tucked in or left untucked. I would buy again.",
Chelsea,Love this top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IZ4WXQO03L74/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK9LPMH8,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Color: Blue Wine RedSize: XX-Large,,This shirt is well made and very comfortable.

Leeshie,Cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QXSH9O8U752S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK9LPMH8,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Color: Dark Green PinkSize: Large,,"The shirt is cute on and true to the online photos. It was a little odd smelling when I first unpackaged it, so I threw it into the wash. It washed and dried fairly well. Overall, it's fine - definitely not a true cotton shirt, but perfect for a casual outfit.",
customer review,Great t-shirt.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RVR6HY8Y1HSJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK9LPMH8,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Color: Blue Wine RedSize: X-Large,,"The shirt has a good shape, it's over-sized so if you order your normal size it should already fit like it's oversized. I love the ringer tee style cuffs and the striped pattern. The fabric is a little on the medium weight side for a t-shirt. Since there is 5% elastane, the shirt stretches, but it won't change from its original shape. You can't stretch it out like a 100% cotton t-shirt. So if you like your t-shirts to be really structured, this is a good casual shirt to have.",
