Luckily you can't see the seem through the front so that is a plus. I also wish the shirt was 3 inches longer so its not a crop, but I usually wear a higher rise pant so it works.  I like a fitted long sleeve top and the material is smooth so its great with so many outfits. I also love the scoop neck. It's not too deep, and it's not too shallow.
