I ordered a large and it fits well without being too tight. It's good for sleeping and under other tops or sweaters, but with the large, isn't too supportive. If I wanted to wear it as a bra, I'd size down for a little more compression.  I've worn and washed them a handful of times and they have held color and shape, without any pilling. I plan to order another set, likely in a medium for a tighter fit. One thing to note, it is VERY obvious when you get cold, so be aware of that.",6
