I really love them. They are awesome. The only thing that I find to be a downside is the fact of how difficult it is to actually buckle the legs. Just with how it is created, it just makes it really difficult to buckle.  That's about it. Other than that, I really love the pants. They fit great. If you can deal with the buckles, you'll be fine.",2

Thought they'd be more of a medium grey but they look more like a pair of black pants that had been washed and faded.",4

You can put the straps on yourself how you like them. They warm and comfy. The ONLY draw back is the zipper pockets dont really have pockets. Like you could hold a pencil in it but dont stand up. Other than that best pants I've had since tripp pants in 2000,
