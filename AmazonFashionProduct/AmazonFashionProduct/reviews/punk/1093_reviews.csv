Smith,The coloring is bad,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPIM5ZBL256QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBYW3NBZ,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Color: F GreySize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"The fit of this shirt isn’t bad, nor is the material. It is quite comfortable however the print looks bad. The shirt itself is ribbed and the color of the shirt is supposed to be purple, but since it is ribbed, it is white between the ridges. It didn’t look as good in person as the pictures and I would not reccomend this shirt.",
