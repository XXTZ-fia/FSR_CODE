Nic,My first fitting belt?!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VU8962PVU72Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BY8LW1F3,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Color: Black With ChainSize: S: Fit for Waist up to 35”,Verified Purchase,Quality was amaze-balls and turns out my girlfriend had purchased this a few years prior and agreed saying it was her favorite belt till she lost it. The chain is removable so you can just wear that if you don’t need a belt or you can only wear the belt. I like the sounds of that because as previously stated all my belts didn’t fit quite right and as they were from Walmart just fell apart. If this belt does something I’ll update but so far so good!,

Great thickness and length.  However the grommets started falling off and I went to my local store and couldn't find the size to replace them.  Its not a standard size grommet I guess. So ... stonger or better adhesive and try and keep any that fall off so you can reattach because replacing is not easy.,

If you intend for this belt to be a daily wearable item, do NOT buy this belt. I bought this belt and it started falling apart within 2 weeks of wear. The grommets fell out, the the faux-leather stretched terribly, and by the time I stopped wearing it I could see the internal cardboard wear the grommet used to be. This belt is cheap, but it’s so cheaply made I still feel like I was ripped off. As a replacement, I bought a belt at Hot Topic for only $15 and it is holding together remarkably well. At this point, you can barely tell the Hot Topic belt has been worn, and I’ve owned it for a month. I bring up this replacement belt only to illustrate that you can find decent belts for a similar price point. It is not necessary to accept this trashy belt. This company can manufacture this belt to a higher quality while still making a nice profit. They have simply made this as cheaply and poorly as possible in order to try and make the most profit possible.",

Not too sure about durability yet. Nice that the chain is easy to remove, a little more difficult to reclasp on a different grommet though. Overall 10/10",

It's now February 2023, and I've worn it many many times since then. It's held up really well. I've updated my review and rating to reflect that.  *Additional edit* It's now April 2024, and the belt is still holding up well. Two grommets have come out but it hasn't hurt the utility at all, and it still looks pretty good. I probably won't update this review again, so suffice to say it was a really good purchase for me.",
