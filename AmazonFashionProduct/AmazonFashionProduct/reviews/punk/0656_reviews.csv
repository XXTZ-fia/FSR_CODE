I was very disappointed in these. They were a little too big and fit very loosely which i didnt like becauae my ankels felt unsupported and makes it easier to roll your ankle. After handling them right out their packaging, I had black material all over my hands - only coming from 1 boot that they clearly glued and it was eating away at the material. They will be getting returned",

I wasn't very good at walking in them and my husband helped when I was on stairs or slippery surfaces. The toe part has grip but the heel does not so if you are on any tile or slick surface you have to tip toe. The heel also kinda feels like it could snap at any moment but it didn't and didn't even look like it was trying. I am not used to heels at all so it could have just been me wobbling haha. So the only thing I didn't like was the slick heel part, wish it had grip like the toe, would have felt a lot more comfortable. But my feet didn't hurt and they don't slip on your foot or anything. I did were socks with them that went up to the top of the boot.",3

Rachel_S,Poor Design Killed This Boot,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AVZJWA27MIDI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8YFYY3K,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 3, 2022",Size: 8Color: Black-s-6,Verified Purchase,"Ok so here we go these boots look super cute and the price isn’t bad either but the fall victim to poor design. The shoe has laces and a side zipper here is the mistake. Zippers are supposed to make it easy to put on boots but the zipper fails here because it’s got these buckles that wrap around the boot shaft where the zipper is.  So in order to put these on you have to undo the buckles that are wrapped around the shaft of the boot then unzip it, put foot in, zip up and then re up re-wrap the buckle and fasten them in place. It may not be a big deal to some folks but to me it’s for design having to fasten buckles is the same thing as having to tie a lace the zipper supposed to be there for convenience and let’s face it ladies if you were in these boots and you’re going out for the evening when you get home the last thing you wanna do is be fiddling with buckles. Oh and the boot heel is slippery on wood floors so that could also be problematic.  So final report card for these boots • Style 5⭐️ stars they are really cute boots • Comfort 4⭐️ stars there are comfortable but the heel can slide so be warned. • Fit 5⭐️ stars they run absolutely true to size. • Design 2⭐️ stars they may be cute but those buckles really killed it for me. • Constuction 4 ⭐️ stars they had some marks like where the pieces were cut off a pattern and had the white chalk like marks on them the came off with a damp cloth but when dry I could still see the faint lines.",28
