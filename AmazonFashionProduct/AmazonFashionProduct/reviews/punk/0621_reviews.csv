But the material is not cargo but also not stretchable making the but and thigh area tight.  They would look better a little looser since they aren't forgiving, but then the waist gets too big. I also don't like the big brown button on the front of the pink shorts.  It doesn't match and isn't needed.  Overall a 3/5 but I think you need really thin legs/butt for it to look more like cargo shorts and less like booty shorts",
