First of all, they are pretty baggy on me.  I went by the sizing guide and ordered a large (and my waist even measures over 32"", so I was nervous at first that they might be too small), but I think a medium would have fit me so much better.  The black material reminds me of the pants my grandmother wore in the 80's (a polyester/wool combo), not my favorite.  The brown faux leather is so extremely thin and feels cheap, I'm afraid it might shred if placed in a dryer (I could be wrong, but it's so thin, I have no confidence it will last).  There are zero functional pockets; the zippers are for show and don't glide well.  The waist band felt bulky to me (could be partially because of how they fit me).  These did fit ok lengthwise, though.  For reference, I am 145-150lbs,  5'4"", inseam is 28"", and waist is about 33"".  Even though these aren't for me, I think the value is ok.",5

Originally I was a little unsure of them, if I would really like them or how they would actually look on me but I am SO glad I decided to go ahead and order them ! They are well made and exactly as advertised ! My only concern is that, bc they have a wide elastic waist band, over time it may bunch up and not lay flat. I feel like I can already feel that happening around the back of the waistband, if I pull the pants up to where my hips are it feels like it wants to roll. I’m hoping that won’t be the case bc I really adore this unique style and of course I want them to last a long time. I will come back and update in the future if need be but overall I am so excited about these pants and I am glad I took a chance going outside of my comfort zone with them. They are way more classy in my opinion than I could have ever imagined ! Definitely recommended ! [ for reference I am 5’3”, 170lbs and I ordered a size Large ]",6
