Elana,Beautiful studded belt and accurate sizes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22BWBWKGZBTNM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKHT9XGC,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025","Color: B-brownSize: Fit Size 31""-35""",,"I got this belt in size 31""-35"" and it fits true-to-size.  I wear a size 10 in women's pants, and I have about a 30"" waist and 40"" hips.  So I can wear this belt at my waist or a little bit lower, but it doesn't quite work for low-midrise pants that sit around my hips.  The next size up wasn't available or I would probably have gotten it for more options to wear, but regardless I really like the brown color, style, and feel of it.  Make sure to order the size that matches your measurements of where you plan to wear the belt (waist, hips, or in between).The studs give it a bit of weight and the gold tip on the end make it look more expensive than it is.  As an elder millenial/emo kid who fully embraced the black and silver studded belts of the early 2000's, I feel like this is the grown-up version of that.  Overall I love this belt and plan to get a black one too!",

Well-made using quality materials.  I was incredibly disappointed in the fit.  I ordered what I thought was the right size, but it runs incredibly small.

Angel,Not what I was expecting,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZ5RP4YOJBMTS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKHT9XGC,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025","Color: D-coffeeSize: Fit Size 31""-35""",,The design itself with the studs all around is nice.  The color is nice as well.The length was accurate but that's about it.  The quality is poor.  It's thin and flimsy.  It's a man made material which I already expected but I didn't expect it to be so thin.  It needs to be thicker.  It twists easily.  It's also too narrow.  I was expecting it to be wider.  It doesn't fill your belt loop and I don't like the look of that.  It came with a belt hole puncher which I  thought was a nuce touch but the product itself I am not impressed with. I'm giving it 2.5 stars,

The fit is true to size but obviously, there is a bit of room since there are various notches. Beautifully made for being fake leather and really looks great with jeans.",
Redrock,Bought this in two colors so far! Great dupe for high end versions.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MRU3C746LQLA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKHT9XGC,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 30, 2024","Color: B-brownSize: Fit Size 31""-35""",,"I previously purchased this belt in black and gold and liked it so much that I came back for a second color! The brown is a perfect cognac/saddle shade. This is an excellent-quality dupe for the $580 KHAITE or $78 Madewell versions. I'm between a size 6-8 (28/29 in jeans) and ordered size 32""-36"". It's a soft, flexible material, and the gold-toned hardware is a very realistic gold that's not too yellow or orange. It is PU leather, which won't last forever. But it's well made and a quality product for the price. It's a great alternative to spending much more money on a trendy item that will eventually phase out of style.",6

I was very surprised how great this belt was when I opened the package...serious looking studs, decent leather, great sizing...plus the seller included a special nail for adding extra holes (I mean, who does that?).  Very impressed.  I would have given it 5 stars but the hardware is a bit too glitzy for me... I am a professional artist so I will rub it with a bit of black acrylic paint to subdue the gold abit and it will take a place next to my sadly MUCH more expensive belts I bought elsewhere.  Great value!",
