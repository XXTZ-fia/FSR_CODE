ht,Great fit and comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1G4E3L5SPRBJM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B079S19RQK,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Purple,Verified Purchase,Received so many compliments on this.

Josh,Too Good To be True,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TIEXIVF3NIPA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B079S19RQK,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 28, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Red,Verified Purchase,"It's a $30 cheap coat made of thin, flimsy poly fabric so it doesn't hang or sit the way it is pictured. The color I received was WILDLY different from what was pictured- I ordered the maroon, and got a bright cherry red garment instead.  I'm not sure what's going on with the other reviews that have pictures- because what they received looks a lot more like the product photos and VERY different from what I received (maybe the listing is using photos of a different item). I'm glad I ordered a size up because this item is in chinese sizing (and therefore runs much smaller than US sizes)- so just a thing to be wary of when ordering. I was sent the supposed ""right"" equivalent size in the asian sizing (a size up from what was listed- i ordered a large thinking i'd just take it in and received an xl) but honestly I still think it runs a bit small (the sleeves were short) even with this adjustment.  The lapels/collar cannot possibly stand up straight the way they do in the photos as they have no interfacing and the fabric is -as mentioned- very thin and flimsy. This garment is also unlined so it's not likely to last very long. It's fine for my purposes (costume) but definitely not good for actual wear.  it's got strong ""ordered from wish"" vibes :/",3

Great quality for a costume ( which is what I purchased it for) however I would never confuse this as being a real coat.

This has to be one of the most beautiful jackets I have purchased...it fits like a glove, front is beautiful, and it has a really cool belt that goes halfway around your waist...around the back, so it really gives the jacket a nice statement of class. It has pockets which are kind of big, but if you smooth them out, it doesn’t make your hips look huge. The pockets are well made, perfect for whatever you need to carry. The cut of the jacket is gorgeous. It comes down to my knees in the front, and as the fabric circles around to the back, it’s get longer and looks very regal.
