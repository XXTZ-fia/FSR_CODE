This item appealed to me greatly. However, even ordering in the largest size available (a large, which is what I normally wear), it fit like a small and I could not even get it up past my thighs. Additionally, the small chain links are like paper and tear at nothing; the shiny aesthetic parts of this outfit had no probability of longevity. And, the suspenders had no adjustment pieces, so if one wanted to wear them up instead of hanging, there'd be no guarantee that the suspenders would fit the wearer's body.  That being said, the site granted me a full refund. And when I encountered a series of difficulties shipping it back to China, they allowed me to simply keep the money and not bother shipping back. I was pleased with how this turned out in the end, as disappointing as the product itself was.",
