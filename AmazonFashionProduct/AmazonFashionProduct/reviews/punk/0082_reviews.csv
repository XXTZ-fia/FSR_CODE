Whitney Surfass,Super Cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKETWPP94WCWE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YM7LZ14,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 24, 2024",Style: Cross Belt,Verified Purchase,This fits great since it is adjustable. I'm pretty small and normally these one size things are huge on me. This sinches nicely and the straps lay well. Quality is okay but for the price not surprising. Will be wearing this often.,
Heather Ruth Destany stowers,Doesn't come assembled,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E01RT0DAWPZV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YM7LZ14,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 2, 2024",Style: Cross Belt,Verified Purchase,"This harness looked like it would be cute. However, it does not come assembled, and it's a little bit tricky to get it to the point where it needs to be.",

Adrian,Looks great,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UJUFONZBHAJI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YM7LZ14,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 16, 2024",Style: Double Belt,Verified Purchase,"I wore this today for the first time. It looks and feels great. Once you figure out how the straps go and size it to yourself, it’s very comfortable. I wish the  ends of the straps had a way to stay down securely though.. I feel like I’m checking often to make sure they didn’t come out of thing you stick the end of the strap through.. overall I’m very pleased with this product!",
Nika,easy to adjust to necessary size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37OIOVJLLL89U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YM7LZ14,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2023",Style: Double Belt,Verified Purchase,"it looks great with anything - white shirt or dress.

Do it. Order it. ROCK IT! Decent quality not uncomfortable! I’m a 38 H and it fit great with room to make it bigger or smaller!,4
Niki LaBeija,Didn't like it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8YH998D0F6AP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YM7LZ14,"2.0 "," the United States "," August 26, 2023",Style: Double Belt,Verified Purchase,It just didn't fit like I had hoped. I tried it in with shirts and body suits and was unhappy with the fit. The two straps at the bottom didn't hit in the waist where I felt it would be flattering.,
Becky,Cute but not worth it.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12N5DVQ0Z4DMU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YM7LZ14,"1.0 "," the United States "," August 10, 2023",Style: Cross Belt,Verified Purchase,"The grommets that hold it together are flimsy. Tried it on when it came in and it practically disintegrated. Grommets fall apart, it left black on my skin and the fabric I layered under.",

Thomas Sombar,Great Harness for the price-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KVOTRKSVZ3QM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YM7LZ14,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 16, 2023",Style: Cross Belt,Verified Purchase,"Overall I am very pleased with this harness - especially given the price, compared with one you’d purchase from free people for example- which would be genuine leather but four times as expensive. It takes some time to figure out placement of straps and to adjust the fit- directions for application/wear would have increased my review to 5 stars.  I wore this to a girls night over a white dress shirt. Then last weekend over a military style blazer - the harness was very adjustable to both thicknesses of tops. I am a size 12/L and this was true to size as described in the listing.",5
Jordan,Favorite piece!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SQ0Q6OUPN2I7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YM7LZ14,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 14, 2023",Style: Double Belt,Verified Purchase,Loved it! Came folded and worried about the creases but once it was on it was unnoticeable. Hard to figure out at first but love layering over dresses and shirts for an added accessory! Sizing had plenty of options and was overall comfortable to wear. 10/10 recommend.,2

Finally decided to try one out with my measurements, and it's not bad. I can it into it, but due to my size (and stomach curve) if I want the bottom two buckles in the front to not be crushed onto eachother I'm going to have to make one more hole to loosen it a but more. I knew that was a risk since I'm 1/2 inch less than the max measurement for that part, so all in all, as good as expected.",
Courtney A.,Too Difficult!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SMFNQT0IQYO5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YM7LZ14,"1.0 "," the United States "," April 12, 2023",Style: Cross Belt,Verified Purchase,This product came with zero instructions on how to put on.

Anna Ramos,"Cute, not the best quality, but cute!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQZ6VL76I2QJD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YM7LZ14,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2023",Style: Double Belt,Verified Purchase,I like this over sweaters and tshirts!

My sizing ranges anywhere from a medium to an XL depending on the brand so I was pretty hopeful. Sadly it barely clasps, there is no way I could wear this in public without looking like someone punched a playdo can",4
