It is definitely not as shown in the picture though. For one, the XL fits like a normal large or medium, its a very thin jacket, the pattern is slightly different, and it attracts lint and hair. It also has a keyring on the zipper, which is non removable. Along with that, the design on the front will probably fry off in the dryer. Overall it does feel kind of cheap, and there are probably better options, but its not too bad and if you want it to fit more like the picturr get the 2XL!",2
