They were thick they didn’t run when I put them on, and I have long fingernails. The stars were rhinestones. They did not fall off. It was like they were embedded into the nylon itself. They were smooth. They held me in and they gave my legs nice shape and lifted my butt. The rhinestones were only on the front of the legs. I would highly recommend these, they are perfect. I got a size small. I am 5’ 6” 120 pounds and I have skinny legs. They do have a black crotch protector so you’ll need to wear longer booty shorts with them so it doesn’t show, If you are wearing a short dress. I wore regular type booty shorts and you could still see a little bit of the black on the crotch, but it worked out fine because I wasn’t doing a lot of bending and the room was dark. I was very happy with this purchase.",
Victoria_C_,“One size” is not for “any” size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTEWWK4IZ1BY6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BV5KKBMX,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2025",Size: One SizeColor: Olivia Stars,Verified Purchase,"Lovely stockings in terms of the feel of the fabric- smooth and silky. However, the fabric is such that runs, tears, and snags seem likely. I felt like my fingers catching against the fabric and it was snagging but didn’t bother to check as I purchased these for a one-time event. The star design and rhinestones seem well done.  The worst part is the sizing. I’m 5’ 3” and had a ton of extra fabric on my legs that I had to keep hitching back up to my groin, and the waistband was pretty much up to my chest. This also made it harder to see the star pattern, as it’s more prominent at the top of the stockings, not the bottom (and that was hidden by the dress I was wearing)  Apparently these were too short for another customer barely 5 feet tall, so when I read that review I was expecting to experience similar, not have wads of fabric and rhinestones hitched up to my hip joints.  Perhaps the size of one’s legs also alter the length of the stockings (which could account for vastly different feedback in these reviews), in which case a “one size” size model is not the best for this item! Make this item in multiple sizes that appropriately fit different heights and body sizes and shapes and accommodate short people with large legs, tall people with small legs, and everything in between!  For reference, I’m about 5’3”, 122 lbs, 28” waist, 36” hips, 29” inseam.",
