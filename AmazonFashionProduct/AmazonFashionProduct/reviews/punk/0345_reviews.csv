Cassidy,Great pants!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OPVV0EDFKL4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4DH8QNS,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2024",Color: Army GreenSize: 3X-Large,Verified Purchase,"They are great pants that I find very comfortable. It’s not pants I’d wear camping or hiking though as much as it might look like that, because they are not going to keep you warm and the material is not thick.  The pictures I posted, I didn’t dress it up to be flattering. I’m obviously not a small build, I know how to make it flattering though. You just have to know how to make it work for your body. Great pants for the price though!",2
Jennifer Kerber,"Comfy and Super cute, High Quality",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGX3RJJYINESQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4DH8QNS,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 13, 2024",Color: PurpleSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"I will add pics soon!  But I am a size 16/18, I have an apron belly. I love these pants. It doesn't hide the belly, but it doesn't make it too highlighted. I do love the color (purple), and the fabric is super high quality. Cons: The darts in the front waist made it seem like a ""Diaper"" front at some angles.  There are also darts throughout the pant leg to make it fall in certain ways. This can be a pro if you like that.",

The pants were a little tight, and they didn't give off much of a baggy look at all. The fabric felt cheap and thin, and the pants made my stomach area look bloated. There was so much air on the top part of the pants, and it was just super unflattering to wear. The color was also much brighter than the original image, which I was a little unhappy about to say the least. I will not be buying another pair of these pants anytime soon.",
