I really wanted to like it. It's cute and looks great, but the shoulders fit really weird. Maybe I have weird shoulders, I don't know. The shoulders just didn't sit right or look good and constantly were requiring adjustment and moving back onto my shoulders. I wore it around the house while getting ready for the renaissance faire and had to take it off before we left because it was driving me nuts. It could just be my shoulders, and if these work for your shoulders, this is pretty cute and had decent materials and lining. The stars off are really because of the annoying shoulder issue, but if this isn't an issue for you, this is a five star from me.",

The fabric is very soft, and I was able to easily add boning for a more authentic look and to make it lay flat. If you don't add the boning, you'll get some major gaping at the laces.

I wore it all day in over 75 degree weather. It has a zipper on the side for ease of putting on and taking off. I ordered the XL and probably would have been fine with a L.  It does run a little big but you can cinch it very tight. Cinching tight does cause that ripple affect in the front but I kind of like it and think its more flattering for my curves.  Also It doesn't have any boning so will not hold any frame or support.  But that just made it more comfortable to wear.  My only big wish would be to have one more eye hole at the bottom to bring the cinching down a little further over the skirt.  Other than that, it's great.  I would totally buy again.",3

Speaking of laces: they're the only thing I really wasn't happy with. They have nothing on the ends to keep them from fraying and they are a very slippery material. I literally tied them in a double knot that pulled itself undone when I bent over lol. Not a big deal in my book because I had already planned to replace them with something more functional, but unless you're getting a looser fit, I'd lace with something else.
