Brandon,Take your measurements,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P7EBJ2DTK0MG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095WKYDC3,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 25, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"A million and one reviews are out there with vague language like ""normally I wear a medium but I bought this and it was too different."" Simply measure yourself, really, it isn't hard and it vastly increases your chances of getting the right fit. I measured myself and bought the shirt size that fits closest to my measurements, and it fits great. This product runs true to the measurements. Decent value. The shirt is somewhat thin, polyester material. That is not necessarily a bad thing. It was actually exactly what I was looking for. The design and color are great, not faded and light like some poly material products can be. Well worth it for me.",

joey,feels incredibly cheap,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23LQX9VH8698E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095WKYDC3,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 27, 2021",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"the fabric this shirt is made of feels a bit like a walmart halloween costume honestly. its very slippery and synthetic feeling, almost like a non-stretchy swimsuit material. the sewing is also a bit uneven and ripply, especially in the sleeves. im not sure if i can actually wear this out of my house without feeling a bit self conscious about how poor quality it looks close up unfortunately.  if you dont mind the fabric and stitching quality, then i do recommend this; its a very cool design and fits true to size, but im probably more likely to take it apart to use as a sewing pattern to remake it in better fabric",4
