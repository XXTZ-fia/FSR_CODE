Super Sparkle Divine,"Unless you're an emaciated model, this is just a sweater.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HQG7BYG0TKVD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B099R6375T,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Size: One SizeColor: Colorful,Verified Purchase,"The material is EXTREMELY thin. Personally, I will not wear this without something on underneath it. To the point that one might consider wearing this ""sweater"" on a cool summer evening.  The sweater came vacuum sealed in 2 envelopes and smelled like a gas station straight out of the packaging.  The colors are not exactly the same as the Pic, but only the discerning eye might notice.  SIZE MATTERS. Unless you're a model with an eating disorder, you're getting a sweater. Not an ""oversized sweater dress. ""  Long story short, I don't believe it's worth $26+ shipping. This is a Shein/Temu item at best, therefore, should have cost less, too.",

KS,It fits how you'd expect if you're tall and plus sized,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV9Q391059IG7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B099R6375T,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 19, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: White1,,"5'10, 200 lb, 40E.  I knew what I was getting into. It's super stretchy, with a very loose knit. It fits, but the oversized look isn't really there. Pretty tough to achieve that in my size, so it met my adjusted expectations.  The length falls about to the hip, chest and tummy fills it out, and the sleeves are slightly oversized, reaching about to where my thumb connects to my palm. The bottom kind of flares out, I imagine to follow the hip to thigh line on someone smaller. I've considered trying to stretch it and reshape it, but it's quite fragile.  I got the rainbow color, and It's definitely unique. Fun and colorful, but I've only worn it a couple times. Because it's not quite long enough, pairing it with leggings doesn't give the look I wanted, but wearing something full body (to elongate the upper to lower body and create a better base for a too-short sweater) might look better, such as a black slip dress or catsuit.  It is a bit scratchy, but didn't give me any major irritation. Still, you may want to wear something that can cover/protect your skin underneath if that's a concern.  Overall, I wouldn't buy it again because of the low wearability potential. If you are smaller, go for it. If you're closer to my size, you might be disappointed.",
