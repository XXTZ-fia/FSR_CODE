Yes they fell a little cheap. I didn’t have any of the spikes missing like other reviewers. For the price and the fact that you get 2 I would buy them again,

I honestly needed to buy these for a Halloween costume. Not only did it work out and fit my big head perfectly, I now wear it all the time! It's cute and it fits, what more can you ask for? Also, just a side note, if you just so happen to have sensitive ears, if you wear it for a whole day, it will hurt. I never had this problem but don't wear it all day if possible. The fact that it came with two of them instead of just one was the cherry on top!",
Sparkles,So cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L7GAY1JWZ7RQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09666TGT4,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 23, 2022",,Verified Purchase,"Not the best quality, BUT for the price it was definitely a steal. You can wear them individually or together to make a bolder statement which is what I did. The spikes are not too big or too small, they are perfect size to me. I’ve had no issues of the spikes falling off or becoming loose, & the headbands stay in the same spot (although I personally add a Bobby pin, just in case). I’ve gotten a few compliments on them as well.",2
