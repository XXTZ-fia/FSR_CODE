They fit as expected and she was so happy with them that my oldest daughter also wanted a pair.  So I ordered another pair in XXL.  Imagine my surprise when the XXL fit SMALLER than the XL.  Now I have one child that is happy and one that is disappointed. The quality control on sizes is seriously lacking and I have to process a return which leaves me less than thrilled.  If you order a pair you have a 50% chance of success in size. Make sure you order up at least one size and cross your fingers.,4

Female For these pants, I bought XXS.  I normally wear USA size 00-0 SHORT jeans from somewhere like Aeropostale, or even size 10-11 in KIDS pants sizes, for reference.  My actual review: These pants are comfy, but probably not suitable for hot weather as they are more similar to athletic sweatpants (think of slightly thicker Adidas pants material). The length was okay-ish (they were a little long, so I had to pull them up to where old people pull up their pants and then they looked fine), and they were slightly big around the hips/thighs for me, but I’m not overly curvy anyways. I bought the size XXS judging from the reviews, so the other reviewers that claimed to be my size might be slightly larger than me or just enjoy slightly more room in their clothes than I do (not that I wear clothes that look painted on or skin-tight).",3

Does not look cheap at all (after you take off the chain anyways, that chain does look kinda cheap not going to lie, but it's not the worst thing ever either and very simple to remove and replace). Hell I even fell asleep in it, it was so comfortable.  The one downside I can potentially see is that this is clearly patterned after asian fashion. As such it might be too tight or uncomfortable on bigger people. I can't say one way or the other, I myself am a slender asian male and for me this fits great. But I don't see it having a lot of ""stretch"" that larger people might need. I ordered a size M (I fit S and XS sized clothes in the US but M in asia) so I knew what I was getting into but I figured I'd add that warning just in case.",3
