I had to loosen the corset laces in back, so, I’d say the large will fit sizes 8-12, depending on bust size. I bought this as my Viking Halloween costume top. It’s going under a really cool, rustic fur and leather shawl from Canada. My cleavage looks incredible in it. I’m wearing it with chocolate brown yoga pants and brown boots. It comes with a matching thong, but I can’t imagine wearing that. It’s made of the brocade corset fabric, so it’s very stiff, but it does match. If you’re only going to wear it in the bedroom, I think it’s fine. Nice of them to include it. I’ll add pics after Halloween. You can tell the leather isn’t real, but this corset is an incredible bargain at the Amazon price, $34, I believe. What a steal! It’s very well made and it looks great. So flattering on the figure, even when you don’t look like a Victoria’s Secret model. It would be super amazing with real leather, but it’s possible a local leather crafter could do that for you. They would only have to replace the parts on the bust and the halter strap around the neck, that’s adjustable. I might look into that, because this is the last Halloween costume I’m doing. Haha! Mark’s Custom Leather on IG made an amazing custom belt for me, so he’s the first person I’d ask. I’d also call my local leather store and ask for a few names of people who do good work. Local is better, but I know Mark is more than capable of putting real leather on it. You won’t be disappointed with this corset, and I love the fact that it’ll still fit me if I went up or down a complete size.",2

I'm 5'3 and 165lbs and ordered 3XL. The zipper did not work when I got it out of package as I had read from other reviews. PRO TIP:  I rubbed a bar soap up the zipper both sides and it glided together no problem. Don't force it! lay it flat and zip it up then turn over and untie bows and start loosening the back straps a bit to try it on for the first time. Hold it up flat to your body and measure that it goes side to side and reaches middle of your body both sides when you look sideways in mirror. Don't fully unlace the ribbons at any time, just loosen then carefully like shoelaces. There is a nice fabric panel across the back so no skin shows how wide the laces are. The front came down below my navel and made my stomach flat as it should. The breast fabric is very thin vinyl so do not tug or pull. Unzip it and hold it up so the lace is behind you like a bath towel then put arms in air and swimmers dive through that top halter. Tricky but that is the idea. zip up the front and wham! Beautiful! Now detach the clasp from left breast area that is the strap with the gold ring and bring across your body at diagonal and reattach to ring under your right breast. All set! I love this!!",9

It didn’t hurt or constrict me like other corsets I’ve worn, but the boning is still very attractive and have a flattering shape, without squeezing me too tight. Would definitely recommend wearing a tank top (or black bra, like I wore) underneath, because the slits with chains over the breasts area open up a little. The laces on the back are adjustable too, but I would recommend having a friend tighten and tie them for you. I also would not recommend wearing this corset while sitting in a car.
