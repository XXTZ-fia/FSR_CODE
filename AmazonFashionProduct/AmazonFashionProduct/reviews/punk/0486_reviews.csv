Darkstar,Far too small. Chintzy material. Not at all close to size in the chart,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FD1RZCM8U4EE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DTD7TM47,"2.0 "," the United States "," August 29, 2024",Color: GarySize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"This is something for small children. It's material is almost like the fuzzy inside of a hoodie. The size chart is completely off, the sleeves were too thin and too short. There was no shoulder room. I thought I was the Hulk trying this on.",
Christopher Green,the size chart is not accurate.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11C8NNG7XJQ7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DTD7TM47,"1.0 "," the United States "," May 30, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,did not fit and followed the size chart. cheaply made.,
Tank69rh,Slim fit?!? not really...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RXG3R647D16Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DTD7TM47,"1.0 "," the United States "," March 15, 2024",Color: GarySize: 5X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I was really looking forward to this jacket for a LARP that I was going to go to but the 5XL jacket that says it fits up to 154cm or 60.63 inches in the bust area would not even fit my friend who wears a normal XL. The tag says it's a 5XL, but I hope it was just mislabeled. Just to explain, my friend's bust size is 42 inches and my chest size is 56 inches. I ordered it bigger since I was going to wearing layers underneath it.",
Martin F. Villa,Perfect for Halloween,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32Y4BE1RNXK5X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DTD7TM47,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 29, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"The material is a soft, satin type.
