Emily,Thought I might like them — absolutely love,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2E4C5VK1P48Q6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CXTGD745,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 17, 2024",Size: LargeColor: 7 Wine Red,Verified Purchase,"Always question buying bottoms online because I’m so iffy when it comes to fabric — this fabric is great. I’m also short (5’3”) and the legs and hanging accessories hang sensibly low beneath my knee when fastened. I went ahead and trimmed the straps shorter. My one thing is that I would describe those straps more as ‘ribbons’, the actual utility of the technical option of ‘hiking up’ the short’s legs is a bit of a question mark for me, as those ‘ribbons’ for straps don’t at all suit the size of the buckles and slip free quite easy. The buckles and chain are relatively GREAT for the price range, actually, which makes the straps lacking extra strange. The chain is fully detachable, which is a massive plus, and is actually extremely handy to have a few of them on hand for styling. I love my pairs and I’ll be getting more ASAP. Staple article — again, “perfect” performance in its price range.",
