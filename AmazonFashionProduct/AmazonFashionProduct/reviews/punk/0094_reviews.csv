However, my skin did have an allergic reaction to it, which happens with almost all metal that isn't stainless steel. I'm assuming the ring is probably just plated in something else to make it black, which is causing the reaction. Frustrating, as this is not mentioned in the item's description.",

Alan,There is something in the ring that is giving me an allergic reaction,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AYMJYMHC5XJG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B098QBY81B,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 24, 2022",Color: SilverSize: 7,Verified Purchase,"This ring is great. It's a cool design. Its tapered inside but if you don't mind it then you should be fine. However, I must warn you that there is something in the ring that might not be stainless steel.  I don't know if its the metal itself or whatever the black stuff is to make the design more clear, but for some reason when I wear this ring my finger starts to swell. I thought that its just my hands swell slightly through out the day and its just a me thing, but with my other rings this doesn't happen. Its specifically this ring. Then I was wondering that I might be allergic to nickel and that this ring contains nickel, but after looking at the item description I could not find anything that says that there's nickel or not so I have no idea what is my body having a problem with.  Its a shame honestly. Besides this reaction, this is a great ring. Just be cautious and if you get a rash or swelling just return it. Thank god that I didn't get a rash every time I wear this ring",
