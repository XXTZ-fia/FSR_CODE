It was not too heavy. It was not too tight nor made me sweat. The chains did not tangle. I hung up this to store. Definitely a great piece for anyone looking to add silver tone to an outfit without having to deal with normal jewelry.,
RW,great accessory for anyone,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16E8SHSVP6LRO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD7P2G9P,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 26, 2024",Style: Black-B,,"This waist chain is a striking addition to any edgy wardrobe.

It adds the perfect touch of punk and gothic flair to outfits, whether for casual wear or a night out. Overall, this body jewelry piece delivers both style and versatility, making it a great accessory for anyone looking to enhance their alternative fashion.",
Jane Fairchild,Love the design but I just wish that it went all the way around instead of just halfway,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C53AIQFHW67R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD7P2G9P,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 23, 2024",Style: Black-A,,Cool chain belt but the chains are only on half of it. So if you're wearing it with the chains to the front the back has no chains which kind of bothers me. It would look a lot better if the change simply went all the way around the length of the belt. But it's cheap and affordable and it does look cool.,

It’s quite long on my teenager, but I think it would fit an adult perfectly. We just modified it for her. The adjustable length is a great feature, making it easy to find the right fit for most.  While the chain does look a bit cheap, she don’t mind since it's mainly for the aesthetic. It adds a stylish touch to outfits without breaking the bank. The design is exactly what you're looking for if you want edgy.  This belt is perfect for an edgy style and really completes any outfit. Whether paired with jeans, a dress, or even shorts, it adds that extra flair. Overall, I’m really happy with what I ordered!",

Leather is Hide, it can be made sturdy and solid. Vinyl is Plastic, and is often messy and prone to delaminating.  This one seems to work just fine for what it is, entirely just the aesthetic side of things, but yeah, that bit annoyed me a touch.",

Don’t get me wrong this will definitely break if you snag it on something and pull hard but don’t do that and you’ll be fine lol.  Before I get into it I wanna start by saying I am considered plus size but I’m more of an “acceptable” plus size unfortunately I did have to add this because if you have more stomach sadly this will not fit you.  If you’re in a smaller frame you will need to add more holes to be able to use it the way it comes it may not be enough to get to stay on you the way you may want it too.  I’ve only worn this once so far and it’s extremely comfortable. I got a lot of compliments and it goes with just about anything. I paired it with the “Forbidden pants”, plain black shirt and ankle high platform boots.  PS: (your body is beautiful big or small don’t let nobody tell you different. You are that girl and will forever be)",2

The belt is kind of scratchy if you wear it against your skin. I really like the style, I only wish it came in different sizes. It's very adjustable but still significantly too big for me, even at the tightest hole. I'd have to make my own hole to make it fit but then it wouldn't look as good as the picture because the chains wouldn't lay properly. My waist size is 27 inches.",

It sounds a little cheap - in the fact that you can tell it's not heavy chain. But a heavier chain may not have been very comfortable. Either way, there are a lot of holes and it looks nice. I plan to wear it against some future outfit that looks too stark and black. This will be a nice addition.",

It is a basic no-frills construction, and the leather belt can accommodate a wide range of waist sizes. That said, I will have to cut it short by several inches as it is too long and there is no attractive way to wear it ""as is"". Otherwise, the chains fall nicely at the hip, and it makes a nice addition for costume or themed wear.",

Unfortunately, I was unable to make it any shorter than I did and it is still a little too big, but will suffice. It's a really cute piece and helps accessorize a plain skirt or dress.",2

The metal is decent quality and so is the build. A nice novelty item for fun and play.",
