Daniel,Harness clip chip,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JNO92BGYYZLK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BM987141,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 30, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I’m not one to review but girl I have to throw in my 2 cents in. Over all this harness is good obviously you get for what you pay for so I knew there was a 50/50 chance of this happening but overall I enjoyed it it’s not to tight the adjustable strap is comfortable I just didn’t expect the clip to break off so quickly. I got it in the mail, everything was fine. I took it out the bag and put in on, I showed my boyfriend it was fine; literally lastnight Saturday I go to put in on and realized a part of a clip had chipped off so that was disappointed idk if I can fix it but im gonna see if I can, hopefully but other then that comment it’s alright you get for what you pay for so don’t expect nothing extravagant.",
DBNX1701,China really needs to design fashion for Americans,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IXUNZB4EQR0D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BM987141,"1.0 "," the United States "," May 7, 2024",,Verified Purchase,I has a 6 ft 2 in cosplayer ( Ranger and Barbarian ) who also works out and never misses a leg day. I have to tell you that this item was designed for an American 12 to 15 year old and not 18 to 54-year-old men and women. It's too bad I really do like the design but it's way too small.,
smiley,good for cosplay,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TBT0HUN3PJZ4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BM987141,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 16, 2023",,,"This is a cute little addon for any cosplay, or to just add a few leather looking straps if that is your style. For my use case it works to add interest to a cyberpunk cosplay. The materials look fine for occasional use, but if you want it as daily fashion wear I imagine it will wear through soon enough. My only con here is that its a little pricier than I think it should be, but still worth picking up if it fits what you need.",
