kmp,So pretty,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RT6VTMFVLQ1X1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4HMQYZ3,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 7, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I tried this with a couple different skirts & pants for work, very nice & feminine. It's also a good shirt for Renfaire or steampunk/pirate/Victorian cosplay. I ordered a size up, and it's a bit looser in the bust than I expected. The torso is customizable due to the ribbons along the back. If you aren't used to corset lacing, it may be helpful to have someone help you set the top the first time - you can reach around and just draw the ribbons from the bottom, but that ends up making the torso tighter than you may like it. No issues with the front buttons or snaps, but the snaps look delicately sown on and may need reinforcement with stronger thread. The fabric is double-gauze, which is soft and lovely - no concerns with transparency. The elastic in the sleeves may be bothersome if you have larger arms. It isn't as stretchy there as I would like. Given it's flat-packed, be prepared for wrinkles. Steaming probably required. Given the button loops, lace details, & fabric, I'll be handwashing this or putting in a mesh bag on the Delicates cycle of the machine, then hanging to dry. My package had a first-use seal before you could open the main bag, and included a tissue insert. Clearly this was not a returned item. Very happy with this shirt & the vendor.",6
Erin Brown,This shirt worked great for a themed outfit. Really nice color and lace details!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWAEK61VLZG9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4HMQYZ3,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 7, 2024",Color: Eggplant PurpleSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I'm 5'3"", 155 lbs, and 36C chest.  I ordered a large. It fit slightly loose. The tie in the back is great as it allowed a lot of flexibility around the mid section.  There was so much extra ribbon in the back that I cut it and used it for a matching chocker necklace.  The material is light and comfortable. And, the stretchy sleeves were nice because I have bigger arms.  The shape is flattering and the lace detailing gives it an authentic look.  I think if you had a long torso, it might be a little short.  I can see how other reviewers mention washing it very carefully.  It's a good value and may last for multiple uses if you treat it gently.",21

I would say these short does run a little small. I am 5’9, 229lbs and this shirt is a 18w, it gives some stretch but not much. I normally can wear a xl in shirts and scrubs . I rated this 4 stars because it came with a glue like stain on the bosom part. Very sad:( But other than that this outfit is a treat and perfect for us to do boo at the zoo next week😍",4

This was incredibly flattering.  My bust was completely covered, no gaping neckline, but still showcased the ladies without showing skin.  Even though it looks low-cut, the neckline is secured.  Seriously, no cleavage.  I couldn't believe it!  The lacing in the back allowed me to synch it so it enhanced my waist, giving me the illusion of an hourglass figure.  My pudgy belly was even camouflaged, as were my chubby upper arms.  This is the most flattering top I've found in the last 10 years.  Bonus: the material is so soft!",3

JH,"Well made, and nice fit.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14PEPEEF4AAAR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4HMQYZ3,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 6, 2024",Color: RedSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"I'm 5'3"", weigh 112, 34DD bust, 25"" waist, & small framed. Wasn't sure on sizing because my bust is always too big for this type of cut if the waist isn't going to swallow me. I got the S & M in red, and will say that the red isn't as pretty in person. It's a more dull red than pic, but it at least doesn't have the orange undertone of so many red clothes (I would have sent both back if that had been the case. The medium fit me nicely. Plenty of room in the bust, and didn't look oversized on ribs and waist. It fit well enough I almost didn't try on the small, but did. The small still fit in the bust without looking weird on my bust, and it fit slightly more snuggly. The upper back felt a bit tight when I rolled my shoulders, but not horribly so. I normally wear a small top, but depending on style have gotten XS & M sometimes. I could have easily gotten away with keeping either of them, and looked nice. Neither had the button gap issue anywhere either. I ended up deciding to keep the small and returned the medium. I washed it in lukewarm water, and dried on low heat. It took that well, but to my disappointment will need some ironing. The buttons are difficult to button. The ""button holes"" are TINY elastic bands that have to be stretched around the half ball type buttons. My small fingers still had trouble. Overall I do like the blouse, and imagine I'll have it for many years to come. I believe that getting your normal size should be a good choice on sizing.",

Happi,"Cute design, horrible fabric that wrinkles so badly.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPFT7EJV5LWTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4HMQYZ3,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 18, 2024",Color: Army GreenSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"The fabric is thin poly blend that while soft, I’m afraid it’ll melt or get shiny if I try to iron it. I tried steaming it in the dryer keeping in mind others negative reviews about the buttons & ribbon. I simply undid all the buttons & removed the ribbon (left it out completely) so there was no tension on those parts of the fabric then put it on gentle cycle dry with a bunch of ice cubes. Two 15 min cycles like this did not damage the garment but it barely got out any wrinkles either. Unfortunately my steamer broke or I’d try that next. I’m afraid to wash it yet because I need it for a cosplay event coming up soon, it was a last minute replacement for changing weather. I might return it if I can’t get the wrinkles out & just borrow my partner’s cotton masc. peasant shirt instead. (Which I didn’t want to do hence the purchase) For the price this is very cheap material & more akin to something you’d find on Shein though the design is very pretty & well thought out. The ribbon is also super cheap which is kind of unnecessary considering wholesale poly satin ribbon isn’t very expensive. If I had gotten the black I’d definitely swap out the ribbon, but the green will be difficult to color match. It’s too bad the fabric quality doesn’t match the design. If it was a cotton blend or even a higher quality poly/rayon blend that would wear better I would give it 5*. I don’t think I’ll be ordering anything else from Scarlet Darkness unless they improve their quality, despite them having tons of cute items. I’m so tired of Amazon becoming a more expensive Shein or AliExpress for the same questionable quality as a hub for any seller regardless of the price point, it’s disappointing. It’s like playing Russian roulette with your wallet.",3

Robyn B.,"Beautiful, but slightly flawed",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HXLQM4ZHNGFK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4HMQYZ3,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 19, 2023",Color: Eggplant PurpleSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I have 2 of these tops, the darker purple one, and the white one with red flowers (I haven't worn the white one yet, so this review is about the purple one)...  The fabric of this top is SO soft and pretty, the ribbon is a single face, roughly 1/4"" satin ribbon, the 'eyelets' for the corset on the back are made from the same ribbon..  The top part of the shirt would be fantastic if you are busty, which I am not, so it fits a little loose, the bottom of the shirt is a smidgen tight (I have distaisys so some of that is *definitely* me), even with the laces fully loose, they aren't necessarily functional laces, but do alter the fit of the bottom part of the shirt.  After washing is where I've found the biggest flaw. I washed it in a garment bag, on delicate in cold water, it did not bleed, but the color of the ribbon and 'eyelets' changed color, dramatically. They matched the shirt nearly flawlessly pre-wash, post wash, they're much brighter than the top, which is unfortunate, but won't stop me from wearing it.  TLDR; top is good for big or full boobs, bottom isn't good if you have a 'baby belly', the corset isn't fully functional but can help with the fit of the bottom part of the shirt. The laces and eyelets on the eggplant colored shirt faded/changed colors in delicate/garment bag/cold wash.",34

I ordered in black. I honestly expected to get some costume stored type shirt, get angry, and return it. But it is actually very comfortable and is not see through. I haven't worn it yet, just received, so I can't say anything on how wel it lasts or deals with washing or fading. BUT. I think this shirt is made for bustier women. I'm a 36c, 5'6 at about 140. I ordered a small and the lacing in the back brings it in the bit I need. But obviously can't pull in higher on the top. There is a good bit of extra room up there and I've gone back and forth on whether I should just return it or not because of that. But I've decided to keep it. The top material is meant to come down in fold so maybe it will make that it's too big. And in the mean time maybe me and my sister can figure out a way to tack in the extra material. If not, it won't be the worst lost I've taken. Would just suck because I really do love the look of this shirt.",5

I’ve gained a few pounds yet the cut gives me a really nice shape.  The front dips all the way to the tops of the thighs, deeper in the middle.  It doesn’t cover your butt, so I wouldn’t suggest this with leggings.  Even if you leave the ribbon loosely tied, it has a super nice shape!  The collar is also very flattering to the chest and shoulders.  I am a broad shouldered larger chested woman, so I’m thrilled with the flattering look.  I bought the XLarge in the denim blue.  The color is spot on but NOT denim so much more comfortable. The fabric is soft and irons well. The sleeves are roomy but not too big or too short.  This looks awesome with blue jeans and skirts!  I’m so happy with this purchase!  Absolutely NOT sheer!  It stretches very little, so don’t plan on that at all.  I may buy this again…..",8

However, I doubt I will ever wear it and the return window closed. I am 5'0"", 120 lbs, size A bra, wide hips. There is a lot of fabric in the bust area that I hoped would create an illusion of curves, but it just hangs and leaves my chest exposed so I would have to wear a camisole under it. Below the bust, it's very fitted and barely covers my hips. However, the ruffles at the bottom hit the widest part of my hips, making them appear even wider. The corset ribbon in the back can only do so much. I bought a small. Neither a larger nor smaller size would resolve these challenges. I may have to bring it to a tailor to have the bust area tightened and shorten the bottom hem, removing the ruffles. Or maybe just give it away. If you have a bust size better proportioned with your hips, this top will look amazing on you. 120",5

You CAN cinch the corseting back down farther; but if you want to go smaller than a 4, this will draw the armholes back so they sit oddly under the armpit.

I am between a small and medium so when ordering from Amazon I typically order a medium since many clothes run small in here.  Also, have a 30inch underbust and 37.5 bust measurement so I often need a medium to make sure it fits in the bust. This shirt has plenty of space in the bust which I love but the medium ended up being too large all over. Going to order again in a small.",3

Fits just right, the color is vivid and deep. Love the draw string back. The only issue I am having is that the buttons pop open, so I am going have to sew the loop tighter not a deal breaker. I also would like to see added care instructions.",5

Snortz,Nice look/ shirt for the cost.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM9RUOWPV1VB3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4HMQYZ3,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 2, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"I think this shirt looks very nice, overall. However, it will take a bit to latch the button hooks- which vary greatly in size, creating some time consumption. Obviously know your own shape- this shirt requires a bit of an hourglass shape, which works for me, but certainly didn't work for my daughter. The material is nice and it is comfortable; I wore it on for over twelve hours on the first day. The look is nice and it is a nice shirt for the cost.",

However, I should have gotten a small as this piece runs true to size.  I was really surprised at how nice the material is.  It did come a little wrinkled and you aren't suppose to iron the fabric, but I think steaming should be able to help here.",
DuckyK,pretty but not quite what i was expecting,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23SK42WDNY9XE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4HMQYZ3,"3.0 "," the United States "," April 4, 2022",Color: Blue HazeSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,I'd been looking at this shirt for a while and finally bought it. I unfortunately was disappointed when I got it. It is smaller than expected fit. The imagie made me think it was more of a cotton blend material but its this soft satin/silk material that has no stretch or give. The largest size did not fit and i'm about 220lb 36 DDD. It's pretty but just didn't work for me/meet my expectations. I think if it did fit I may not have kept it due to the material/look as i was planning on using it for interviews/nice fancier work shirt and it wasn't quite professional looking for that.,2

Its fabric sewn to mimic a corset look.  The shape is Very flattering around the bust area. The ribbon back to tie to me the back look like a corset was way too long and awkward.  Not flattering for me.  I did size up adter reading reviews and glad I did for my boobs. But made the rest fit awkward too big.",2
Review Girl,"Sexy fit, impossible to button!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CVXAHLCLXXDO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4HMQYZ3,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2021",Color: BlackSize: Small,Verified Purchase,Beautiful shirt! I can’t state that enough! It looks fabulous on and is very flattering. I ordered the size that Amazon recommended (2 sizes smaller than what I usually wear) and it fits like a glove! It is very sexy although the material is kind of thin and I am a little worried about washing it.  My only real complaint is how difficult it is to button in the front. There are plastic buttons and elastic loops that you must fit over the buttons to properly close the shirt in the front. There are probably 8 to 10 buttons on the front and it took me 20 minutes to get them all secured. Just to try it on that was kind of a nightmare. Taking them off was equally difficult. I am concerned that the buttons may not stay on because they are not sound very tightly. I will probably reinforce them myself and then sew snaps on instead of the ridiculous elastic loop closure.,2

What I didn't care for were the elastic button fasteners. They stretched too much, and I like a cleaner look. Perhaps a larger size might have helped with that.
