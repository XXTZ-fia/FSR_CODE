I only give it a 4 because it did not come with the string to lace it up in the back. That can easily be replaced so I did not send back. It's a nice fit. Decent material. Nice color.,

aforney,Feels cheap and missing ribbon,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5BPA0TVOU44V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQL43B9C,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 16, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I like the design, but the fabric looks a bit cheap so I’ll probably only use it for costumes.

W. Mitchell,Small fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WHI5OQK5H6R5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQL43B9C,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 16, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,This arrived just in time to complete my costume. (I’m a Transylvanian from Rocky Horror) Here’s what you should know… I ordered size small (I wear size 2/4) and it fit just right with the button undone. Buttoned it would have restricted my arm/shoulder movement. I ran the lacing in the back but didn’t use it to cinch. The fabric is definitely cheap costume polyester. Overall I’m happy with the purchase because it makes the outfit (and covered my tush).,
emeek,Holes and missing pieces,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXOYLCEL4ZLOD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQL43B9C,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 14, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,There's a hole in the seam in the back. Also there is 5 tabs one on side and 2 on the other so there is no way I can even lace up the back. This was a waste of money and now I have to try and make it work for a costume.not happy with this at all!,3

Not worth the price",4

This one seems too big, but it will do. I am sure even though it is big it can shrink. I love that it goes well with the skirt. Honestly it is nice and good for what you pay for.",3

Go up a size . I tried it on. Put bag in bag and set back next day. Material is weird. Like a swish every time you more. Refund was fast. I wouldn't waste my money unless you using it for a Halloween party or just once. Price is over rated.,9
