Jeneane Vanderhoof,"A dress I thought I'd wear for Halloween, IMO can wear anytime",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10N4DC1BY8NZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D924JYJ2,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 5, 2024",Color: Dark GraySize: XX-Large,,"I ordered this dress for Halloween however when it arrived and I looked at it- I realized I could wear it all the time. The designer had used materials and cloth that, IMO, tones down the Gothic style enough that it can be worn daily. When you see it in my video review please remember that clothing doesn't look it's best, at least IMO, when someone isn't in it (and I'm no model and do not want to be online like that, sorry ;). Suffice to say the dress looks great when on, however it is a little short in the front and I haven't decided whether I want to wear black pants with it. I tried the dress on with and without a black yoga pant underneath and the dress looks great either way. However I'm older and don't really do shorter dresses anymore and while the dress is long in the back- it is short in the front because of the separation there (please look to my video to see what I mean). This dress fit great and I never thought I'd find something like this to wear- and I love the hood on this dress- it actually makes it totally perfect for me. I only wish I would have had this dress as a teen, as this definitely would have been something I loved then too.",
Bluemoon,"Small, thin, nice details",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLJ1M40ZWI23H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D924JYJ2,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 20, 2024",Color: Deep RedSize: XX-Large,,"I like this gothic top, but I'm not sure about wearing it yet. It's rather thin material, and also fitted, so it shows off more than I'd want. Also, the waistline of the skirt or pants you wear underneath shows through and ruins the smooth look it's supposed to have. Also, I was a bit disappointed because I didn't realize there are also slits on the side. From the images, it was hard for me to tell. I don't like the look as much with the side slits too - I wish it was a full skirt around the sides and back. Other than those cons, I do like the top a lot. The sleeves are a tad long for me, but I love the flare and how soft and flowy they are. The frills on the bottom are pretty, and the buckles don't feel cheap and look nice. Just be careful, I almost snagged my eye with one when I was pulling it inside out off my head lol. This top is so pretty, but not right for me right now.",
Howling Tortuga,Not as described,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ABDNCRUM139F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D924JYJ2,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 21, 2024",Color: Dark GraySize: XX-Large,,I was expecting a lot more than I received. Very thin material. Doesn't look like picture. Runs small. This would of been a return for myself. I feel grateful and thankful. I hope this finds you well and thank you kindly for reading.,
Hunter,Size up.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1F0UY03OL6W5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D924JYJ2,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 20, 2024",Color: Deep BlueSize: Large,,When ordering do not go by the size chart definitely size up. I wear a large in tops and that's what I ordred and my top I got fits like a medium/small.,
David,Nice design,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROYMS3IUTA1N8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D924JYJ2,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 13, 2024",Color: Deep BlueSize: X-Large,,"This looks better than expected in person. My wife loves it. It does run about a size small though, so it's probably good to get one size larger.  The design is actually quite good. The detail in the buttons and how the sleeves flare fall nice on the body.  This is a really good piece for Halloween.",
Shirley S.,Not the color I expected!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R57B393JEBG7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D924JYJ2,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 8, 2024",Color: Deep BlueSize: X-Large,,"Came well packed and on time, but I must note that the color didn't quite match the description or picture. Despite this, I liked it! The unique high-low hem, buckle details, and flared sleeves give it a witchy vibe perfect for Halloween or everyday wear. The soft, comfortable fabric makes me feel like I'm wrapped in a dark cloud (in the best way possible). If you're feeling adventurous and don't mind a surprise, take a chance  – just be aware that the color may not be exactly as expected!",
Mark T.,Comfortable warm dress top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27S3CZLBQV1TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D924JYJ2,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 10, 2024",Color: Dark GraySize: XX-Large,,Looks like a nice costume piece or something to wear on a chilly night out. It's much nicer than I expected and true to size. I like the grey colors and the buckles look. Nice length for arms and dress part. Hood is nice and spacious!,
