Thin material similar to pantyhose so not meant for winter temps depending on where you live.  Not very stretchy to go up all the way as it shows.  Great concept.  Just more costume wear than going out with fashionable arm-warmers -- thicker material would be a big plus.  I'm wearing them but they're not on my ""favorite-to-wear"" pair that look just like them which are surprisingly warm despite the open armed criss-cross style.",2

They were so much fun to wear. It takes some time to put on bc of the straps. So have patience and enjoy the look once it's all done. The spooky kid in me loves these so much. Buy Them!!!,
marin beasley,web design comes off,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SMOMD7T5IVQQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B5DMNPPJ,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 8, 2022",Color: Spider Web Arm Warmer,Verified Purchase,the web design wore off after only a few wears. if you are sensitive to fabric texture i wouldn’t recommend this. the frill bits on the ends were making my sensory issues act up quite a bit. i bought them for a costume but they go with my style aswell so i thought id get a couple uses. the wev design sadly wore off on the palms and elbows first. im sure through enough wear the whole design will come off.,3
Shawn G.,"Loose at the end, but looks great 👍",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ONQ4BYH9X46E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B5DMNPPJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 18, 2022",Color: Arm Sleeves for Women Mall Goth,Verified Purchase,"It's a pretty nice arm warmer, only complaint is the ends are loose so they fall if your active. Would of been nice if the straps were further at the end so they wouldn't fall. Otherwise nice product!",
loki,It's a 2 person job,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6MQULI1AIHTW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B5DMNPPJ,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 18, 2022",Color: Arm Sleeves for Women Mall Goth,Verified Purchase,"The look great but nearly impossible to put on by yourself. I have a few different varieties of this style and I can buckle/tighten them easily. The straps are very thin and lightweight and threading them in the buckle, and securing, is really hard. If you have someone do that part you're in luck. If you like the dangly look then you're all set. I don't think they can handle too much hand usage without tearing.",
