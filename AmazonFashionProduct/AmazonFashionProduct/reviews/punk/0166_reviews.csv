Here's my take on this fashion accessory:  **Pros:**  1. **Fits Well:** One of the things I appreciated about this waist harness belt is that it fits well. The adjustable design ensures that it can accommodate various body shapes comfortably, which is essential for a body chain.  2. **Cute Appearance:** In terms of aesthetics, this belt does have a certain charm. It looks really cute when paired with the right outfit, especially for those who enjoy a punk, goth, or rave style. It can be a unique addition to your wardrobe.  **Cons:**  1. **Low-Quality Materials:** One of the significant drawbacks of this body chain is the quality of materials used. The materials feel somewhat low-end and not as durable as one might expect. This may result in quicker wear and tear, which is disappointing for a fashion accessory.  In conclusion, the BODIY Punk Waist Harness Belt has its merits, such as a good fit and a cute appearance that can enhance your fashion choices. However, the quality of materials used is notably lacking, which can affect its durability. If you're seeking a trendy addition to your wardrobe and don't mind a potential short lifespan, this body chain might be suitable for you. Just be prepared for some wear and tear over time.",

Now, I'm a bigger girl with a wide rib cage (roughly size 18 pants, wearing between a Large and XL shirts). I was wary that this harness would still fit me; but upon trying it on, it was fantastic. My partner absolutely loved it. I could wear it with just a shirt and no bra and had enough structure and stability (bonus!)  Only down side was that some of the material was pulling up upon taking out of the package before I even tried it on.

My waist is in the ballpark of 38"". Once I had it buckled, I actually had it on the 5th or 6th holes on both belts, fitting directly underbust (I'm a 38C), which looks good if you've got a decent bra for lift or your girls naturally sit upward. It will definitely work for the costume I have planned.  Two minor issues: There are a LOT of holes to choose from, which is great, but many of them are not punched all the way through, which wasn't a problem for me because i needed holes that are punched completely. However, if you're not lucky, you may have to punch them yourself to get it to fit. It doesn't look like it would be too hard with a small nail or similar.  The second issue I had is that it was rolled up backwards in the package. Instead of being rolled with the finished side on the outside of the roll, so the ""memory"" of the material curves inward towards your body, it was rolled with the unfinished side on the outside of the roll, so the ends of the straps stick out awkwardly. My event isn't for a few days, so I've got the ends rolled in for the time being to try to train the straps ends to point towards my body. So I would recommend buying a few days ahead of time so you have time to correct the straps so it doesn't look sloppy and awkward. It's pretty common sense to roll belts with the rough side facing in, so I'm not sure why it was packaged this way. Maybe it was a fluke.  Overall it seems worth the money. It seems pretty sturdy for the price and it looks good on.",9

Because you can adjust both the arm holes and the position of them, I think it helps the harness fit a pretty a pretty wide range of folks. For example I have larger arms/wider back and I was able to move the angle of the arms closer in so there was more room on the back.  That being said there isn't a ton of extra belt for holes to be added, if you need. The ""leather"" is actually a pretty decent quality for the price thought and the look of the harness is great.",12
