E. Falconer,Very nice belt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BG4RRLEZGM5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DM8PSVWG,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Color: CoffeeSize: L: Fit Waist Size 36-40 Inches,,This is a nice width and feel to it. Easily fits through loops on jeans. I love the color and the gold rivet embellishments. Plenty of holes to allow for medium to large waist size.  The only thing I would add is a loop to hold excess belt to wear with a dress.,
KimD,Nice belt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OBNZZZYR9YRT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DM8PSVWG,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Color: CoffeeSize: L: Fit Waist Size 36-40 Inches,,This belt is made nice! It fit my smaller waist perfectly. It’s thick enough to hold its shape. I loved the rich brown color. It has plenty of holes for adjustments.,
Customer review,A great retro belt!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RGFB7C8AJ41O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DM8PSVWG,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Color: RedSize: M: Fit Waist Size 31-35 Inches,,"I had a belt exactly like this in the 80s. So when my daughter asked for funky belts for Christmas, of course I had to get her this one. Mine has long since disintegrated. XD This one feels so much sturdier than the one I had. It's thick, and the studs are riveted in really well. It fits her true to size. She's a size large, and she can wear this one either normal through the belt loops, or slightly loose and hanging off her hips the way I did. And the red is a nice, deep, orange-base red. I really like this belt. I'm kind of disappointed I didn't think to get myself one. XD",
Customer R,Beautiful belt when worn with pants that have tight beltloops,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R225Z75FSMDLC1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DM8PSVWG,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2024",Color: Light BeigeSize: L: Fit Waist Size 36-40 Inches,,"This is a very nicely made belt.  The studding around it is attractive.  But one thing to be aware of is that the belt studs do not cover the entire belt.  If you have beltloops that are going to keep the belt together then this belt is great.  But if your belt loops don't hold the belt together then you may see the part of the belt that is not studded. Also if your waist size means that you have keep the belt at it's largest sizes then you may also see part of the belt that is not studded.  You can see in my second photo the part of the belt that is not studded.  I  understand that it may not be studded so that the belt will lie flat against itself, but I have some pants that allow the belt to sag some and you can see the part of the belt that isn't studded. I don't like that look.  Also my waist is 37"" so I got the large, and there is a large overlap on me.  So for me I'll be wearing this with jeans that have beltloops that keep the belt together.",
Galaxie Girl,Great belt- but needs sizing adjustments,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19E0JQVEAMA6N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DM8PSVWG,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 25, 2024",Color: WhiteSize: S: Fit Waist Size 26-30 Inches,,"This is a cool belt! It’s good quality, and I love the wee round studs. My only issue is the sizing! I’m pretty thin, and while I love that they made this belt very versatile to where it can fit people of several sizes (I’d say anyone with a waist between 25 inches to 34) comfortably- there’s something that they did not consider…  Which would be that we skinny folk will be fastening the belt tightly, to where a LOT of the rest will be left flippy flapping- with nowhere to go! It’s gonna hang down, and look lame.  Either have several sizes that we can choose from, based on our particular measurements- or, offer an extra ‘bracket’ (the thing you put the end of your belt into, the silver thing, once it’s on -like a belt loop on pants). That’s my only gripe. It’s otherwise a nice belt.",
Hypnoglitter,Looks great!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REX8VE8QCWPZA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DM8PSVWG,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 24, 2024",Color: RedSize: S: Fit Waist Size 26-30 Inches,,"This belt looks great - it's thick and well-constructed, with rivets for the studs. Recommend!!",
ilovenachos,Quality Belt With A Punk Chic Flair,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6589OYX64DXU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DM8PSVWG,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 19, 2024",Color: WhiteSize: S: Fit Waist Size 26-30 Inches,,"I absolutely adore this style of belt, the skinniness of it gives it a glam, elegant look while the studs lend a rock and roll vibe. The quality of the studs and the metal finishing is really good. Sizing is correct too! I'm looking forward to upping my waist game with this fun new addition!",
