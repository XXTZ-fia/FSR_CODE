Zippers and studs, not so much.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR0C32OMI7ACT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BKXZLR85,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Wine Red,Verified Purchase,"Love the style and the alligator print is a plus. The jacket fits well, a little sung but this jacket should fit close.  I got a large and tried on with a lightweight sweatshirt. I would give 4 stars but the quality of the zippers are low budget so be careful with the zippers, and as soon as I took it out of the package, a stud came off. I fixed it though. This was a gift from my sister and I had to return the first one because the zippers were awkward and off track. This one is better but they are flimsy. Can't wait to rock this, and the color is everything!  Will look fly with jeans!",4

I ordered the xxsmall and normally I am xsmall.  I love the jacket but it does not fit snug. There are no pockets and the flaps up top do not snap down.  The zippers are a bit awkward.  The sleeves are a little roomy which is nice, doesn't leave you feeling like you can't move your arms.",2
