It arrived with a sulfur smell, possibly from the dye process. I should have immediately returned it then, but the shirt was so cute and I knew if this shirt had the smell - any other would too and I would not be able to own this shirt. I wanted to make this work, so I tried to fix it.  I have washed it 5 times since I recieved it. I used laundry deodorizer, Arm and Hammer, vinegar, simply trying to cover with Febreeze or scented softener crystals (mmm, sulfur and flowers), and even the expensive good stuff I use to get cat urine smell out of my senior cats bedding... NONE of these got the sulfur stink out. I've tried wearing it hoping maybe it wasn't that strong or bad, but when friends hugged me -they politely let me know I had an odor.  This shirt stinks, I wish I had returned it... its unfixable :( 2 stars for cute cut and design at least, but I warn against buying.",
