Alex,Nice elastic and quite comfortable!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YHR39UQHE6D6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YHCK6L3,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Size: Fit for Waist Size 28''-33''Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"I love that the elastic quality is noticeably good. It’s quite comfortable to wear and do a full day of cosplay in. Only downside side in my eyes is that the buckles on the front for you waist don’t have another metal belt loop thing so that the excess straps stay closer to the lower portion of the wait belt, just doesn’t give that super clean look. But overall good product for the price. I am very happy with it!",
Laurie,Too big and poor quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQV09QCS08X4J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YHCK6L3,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Size: Fit for Waist Size 34''-43''Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"This felt very cheap to me, and the way it was packaged it would take a long time for the folds to relax, making the belt not lay flat on your body.

Some straps were curled a little upon unboxing, but just put something with a little weight in top to help flatten them. It seems durable, but time will tell. Some other reviews claimed it arrived moldy, worn, no holes, etc, but I noticed those reviews were mainly out of the country. I received it with no issues with the item. I purchased the 28"" size and it fits nicely and pretty comfortable. Can't wait to try it out.",

It adds a little more of a sassy, rugged look to otherwise plain outfits. I’m 5’4” and 152lbs (size 6/medium and 36B), ordered the waist size 28”-33”, and it fits comfortably. Initially, it was a little loose but it provides many accommodating buckles to customize the fit. Its pitfall is that it has a terrible smell. Straight out of the pouch it smelled “old” and upon unfolding, it smelled like a really damp and musty basement. This smell is strong and wiping it down or airing it out does no good— it still stinks and that smell will transfer to your clothes and hair within 5 minutes of putting it on. If you can get by with that, it’s worth the buy but for me, that renders this 100% unwearable.",
Ryn,Few things to note,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33HC8QXC3GAF1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YHCK6L3,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 29, 2024",Size: Fit for Waist Size 28''-33''Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"Overall got what was pictured/advertised, but just a few things to take note of if you plan to purchase. First, I'm pretty sure this is real leather and not PU based off feel, look, and smell (it has a pretty notable leather smell), but I'm no expert so it could just be a pretty good dupe. In regard to smell; it came with a very heavy mildew smell, no signs of mildew or mold on the piece (unlike some other reviews I've seen on here) just a very very strong smell of it, enough to make an entire area retain the smell. I've just been dowsing it in a water/vinegar mixture and airing it out outside and the smell is getting better, but would be very aware of this before purchase if you don't want to potentially deal with it. Last thing, I received my item late and only after reaching out to support. They will not inform you if they a) don't have a the item at the warehouse closest to you and b) if the item never actually shipped. Only was ""informed""--and when I say informed I mean me going into the app to check what is going on--that the item never actually shipped until after it was already supposed to be delivered and then after 2 days of no updates on the shipping, contacted support where I was informed they never actually had the item in stock. After talking to support and having them submit a ticket, the item was actually shipped out the next day. So, while the item is what is advertised (though may actually be real leather), there a few issues with this particular item to take into account before purchasing.",

I got the largest size harness which is like 34-39 inches or so and I'm glad I did. It's my new favorite way to style clothing and not just wearing the clothes. This harness gives me a confidence boost, honestly. I'm heavy topped with size 40D chest and do carry weight in my stomach so I was worried this harness might emphasize those things but no; it enhances your chest area while cinching the waist just right! I think I'm gonna get this in the white too. I got some new dresses on Amazon and one of them made me look like it was swimming on me so I got this harness for the long sleeve dress pictured and it changed the entire outfit for the better! It amped it up and made it sexy yet casual enough for every day wear. This is stretchy and comfortable and stays in place just fine. Would definitely recommend this harness! For 18 bucks, it's worth every penny. I'm a size 12, 177 pounds and this fit perfectly. Love love love this!",5

To be fair, my back has been giving me a special kind of hell lately. But this friend didn't know that. If you're looking for a fashion harness, I say give this one a try. Bonus points if you're also wanting to look like you've slipped a disc. I don't imagine it will actually provide thoracic support however, and I'm not a doctor, so I can't endorse this product as a medical accessory. I do think it fits well, especially if you're a bigger girl and are having trouble finding a cute harness to properly hug your curves without lacerating your underboob. I'm a size 14-16, and I got the biggest size, and there is some room to grow. Oh, you might be interested to know that my husband asked me why I was wearing a holster since I didn't have any guns. So, take these words and do with them what you will. If you're willing to risk looking like a gangster who's had her gats ganked, get the harness. It's cute.",17
