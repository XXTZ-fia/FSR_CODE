Exquisite reviews by Ally,Quality Faux Leather Bomber,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31S02S3M0D62O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFPTW1BW,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 28, 2024",Color: BlackwhiteSize: Large,,"While doing some shopping I found this really cute faux leather bomber coat made by the Trendy Queen store. I liked the oversized look along with the contrast of the black and white. The faux leather is of good grade- very supple feeling which was a nice surprise. The front of the jacket has pockets - which are deep enough. The coat closes with a zipper closure. It is longer than what I would normally think of as of ""bomber coat"" to me that is more cropped. I'm 5'9 and thought this was long even for me.  They do offer this jacket in three variations which are as follows: -Black and White -Brown and White -Black, Red and White Sizes range from XS to 2XL  All in all, I find that this was designed very well. The fit is loose and I did not have to size up or down with this jacket. Again, I would reiterate that this seems longer than most typical ""bomber coats"" - I would recommend measuring to ensure this will work for you. Based on a positive experience- I would recommend this to other consumers. Thanks for reading my review. I hope it was informative and helpful. :)",

Loose at the bottom with room in the chest.  Once again...too long in the sleeves.  Why is everything from Amazon too long in the sleeves?  It's fairly soft and not very heavy.  I live in Northern Ohio.  It's good for now weather but definitely need more for later.  All in all, I believe it's a great value for the money.  I got the plain black and white in an XL.
