So, I saw these and thought, 2 birds & 1 stone, those could work! (The birds got their revenge.)  Unfortunately, despite what my pictures display, this style has more black & gray tones, than the rest of my ""assassin-elven-like"" costume, (which would have been perfect if my corset, sword strap and belt were black. They are multi colors of dark brown and coffee colors). Maybe next Halloween or my next Con!  However, after trying them on, I found them to be so ridiculously soft and silky. Plus, they make me feel kind of bada$$. So in conclusion for me, I'm definitely keeping them and the print is amazing.  Beware, as some other reviews mentioned, there are a few spots where the white dye is saturated, it is a bit see through. But I tend to wear long shirts and I'll be careful about whose around when bending over (wink, wink) so it doesn't matter to me.",10

I am 5'7"" 150lbs with moderately muscular and toned legs. 'Medium' was the size I went for and the fit was pretty much perfect.
