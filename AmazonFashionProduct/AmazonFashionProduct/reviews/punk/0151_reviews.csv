Dem,Don’t wear it with dark clothes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R83WKI91FUDLN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C2TJMXM8,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 12, 2024",,Verified Purchase,Love the looks and style great for plus size babes. I just don’t recommend wearing it with black clothing. It did stain the pleather and haven’t been able to get the black stains out. For the price I can’t complain but it’s unfortunate cause I now can’t wear it with anything but a few black outfits. But it’s so comfortable and fits great on my curvy body.,
Courtney A.,Very cute.

It’s a cool design and you get what you pay for with the quality, but I would not recommend this style to anyone that wears above an X-Large, especially if you’re trying tie over a large chest. Some of the other harness designs might work slightly better. Wish it worked, that would’ve been cool. Giving two stars even though it can’t be used for its purpose, because I should’ve checked the standard of measurements being used.",3

Carsen,Plus is ENORMOUS AND FITS WRONG,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LH4NDI3ZVHCO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C2TJMXM8,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 8, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"There should be a diagram sent along witht he product to show the correct attatchments and way to wear. That is the most constructive Now, I am a top heavy 5'5"" (164cm) and 263lbs (119.4kg) and my partner is 5'3"" and 196lbs ( idk her specific metric measurements) she is very dainty up top, like a pear. That said, it fot NEITHER of us. The strapping was enormous on us both. I have a broad upper body with broad shoulders and this was big on me shoulder and backwise but unable to wrap the way it shows in the pic. It was even bigger on my partner and unable to wrap on them like it shows at the underbust. The staps are uneven in the holes set and there is a LOT of excess strap for the parts that come around your shoulders. Like, I had to make more holes and then chop off over 6 inches of the two straps. Mid back is fine and again the part to wrap around is short and does not sit as shown in the picture. My partner and I are near opposites in body type and this doesnt not fot either of us very well without severe modification. Quality is okay, and again I had to refer here on Amazon to figure out assembly and how to wear it right. Do to the light and mildly flimly nature of the buckles, specifically the horizontal one, it will become undone and just slip open. I don't hate it and I have a mind for modifying this kinda of stuff. But, I'd evaluate worth of effort for anyone looking to buy this.",4

When I got it it's actually pretty decent! It's not not a thick leather but it look  like good quality! The only thing is that it doesn't fit me. I am standerd 2xl and it was a bummer that it didn't fit. I can however alter it since the shoulder straps had extra but it was a bummer. If you are a XL I think this would fit well!,

I can buckle it in the back and simply not have the intended look I checked the measurements specifically before ordering and it claims it fits a much larger waist than my own. It's cheap, and poorly measured, since there is a surplus of vertical material and a deficit of horizontal material.  I thought about trying to somehow fix it, but I may just use it as a basis for sewing my own fabric version. Cute idea, poor implementation for claiming plus size.",2
