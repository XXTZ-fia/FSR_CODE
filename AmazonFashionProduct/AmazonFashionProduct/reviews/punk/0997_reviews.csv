Amanda,Order Up,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ119O6JYWVOR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBPSHJLR,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 27, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"After reading the reviews I was slightly hesitant to purchase being a plus sized gal. It is not super soft on the inside but thankfully it is not itchy either, and I tend to have more sensitive skin. It has been washed a couple times due to young children touching it, and the design has held up, as well as the shape. It was advertised as oversized but getting my normal size it is a bit more fitted than I had hoped so if you want the extra slouch I would size up. Not as soft and not as slouchy leads to 4 out of 5 stars.",

It is NOT like the photo just fyi and it has a tapered waist, which I prefer, and the sleeves I’m a little worried are almost too short and after a wash so I may exchange for a size large. The print is great though as is the feel of it!",2
E. Rakovec,It doesn’t have to be October to wear,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2K107WPV8IEQW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBPSHJLR,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 25, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I’m in my oversized sweater era, and with fall approaching I immediately searched me a skelly sweater.

Sizing is pretty normal, so I would suggest getting a size up if you want it oversized. The print on the shirt isn't as crisp as the photo shows and is missing lots of detail, but not bad.",20
