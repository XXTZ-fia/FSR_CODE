I needed it for this weekend and was able to wipe it all off, so I didn’t return because I wanted to wear it. However, the belt is rusted and peeling and the skirt came dirty and needed to be wiped with a wet cloth to get all the dirt and dust out.",6

Cherry,Looks cute but not a fan of the fit and fabric,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3N9XSG87PBA35/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09WKLSD4K,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Black 3,Verified Purchase,"This skirt is okay. I like the overall design of it, the buckles on the front are cute and a nice quality and the laces on the side are nice. They are made of a leather-like material and stay tied when you tie them. However, the fabric is thin, has no stretch, wrinkles easily, and sits weird on my body. The suspenders don't secure easily so I'm always retightening them, and there's no zipper or anything in the back so you have to put it on by unlacing the sides and lacing them up again. I feel like with a petticoat or tutu this skirt would have a bit more life to it, though. I feel like for the price it should have a fabric with a little more give to it. It could just be that I have curves, so this skirt might sit better on a small framed person with narrow hips.  For reference, I'm 5'0"" and 135 lbs, I got a small.",4
