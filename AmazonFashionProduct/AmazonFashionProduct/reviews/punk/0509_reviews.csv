Based on the sizing chart, for my waist, I would be between M and L (normal for me in other clothes). I ordered a 2XL. It fit fine and MAYBE could have gotten away with XL, but it would have been uncomfortable. The pocket doesn't hold much beyond a few bucks and a moist towelette packet. I tried to put dog treats in a sandwich bag and it couldn't expand enough for it. There is a divider inside, so the parts are even smaller than you expect. I prefer low rise, so I rolled the waist band down.",

Frankly looks a LOT better in the ad, would have expected a skirt double this length if the photo were true to the garment. this skirt is waaaay shorter than the photo would suggest. 2. the belt for the skirt is too short, there is absolutely no hang to the very low quality belt. 3. i got a 2x. i am a size 18 at torrid and i would say this wouldn't fit anyone who wears larger than a size 16. the sizes are at least one size off on labeling and they obviously skimped on fabric in every way possible making the garment really awkward, it doesn't really fit together right after it's on a person. losing weight won't help this because the belt would need to be twice as long as it is to hang as low as the ad depicts. 4. frankly i should return it with a hearty fu for lying about your cheap product, but i am keeping the garment in hopes that it will fit right in a couple months if i continue to lose weight. the quality is not at all what you'd expect for the $40 price. luckily the GLARING design flaws in the garment are pretty easy to fix with an extender, so that's the only reason i'm gonna keep it, (but the company should have really worked harder to advertise honestly and size properly)  tbh tho if you're looking for anything more than a costume piece i would look elsewhere.",11
