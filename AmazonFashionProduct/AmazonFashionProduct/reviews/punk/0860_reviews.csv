I think it's a company wide trend too, because I ordered a long sleeve shirt from them and the cuffs were fitted and made it tough to roll your sleeves up. I get that they have artwork on the sleeves, and it's pretty cool artwork, but I should also have the choice to roll them up if I need to get some stuff done.  I still gave them 3 stars because as far as asian streetwear goes, their designs are among the coolest.",

Beanie isn't super tight and perfect for someone like me who gets migraines easily from head wear, and the sweater is super cuddly on the inside.  Two white hoods came with marks however, one an odd yellow mark on the shoulder and the other metal had oxidized and stained thr fabric. Currently waiting to hear back on either how to clean them or if I'm stuck with a replacement. Not handy as these are going off to the UK.  Everything came sealed individually and quality wise they're awesome. Many happy years of wearing these to come.  The shoes are comfy too.",
