These look great on, & quite fashionable. The quality of the boots is great, & the craftmanship is well done. I have worn these for a few of the casino parties that I work, & they have held up, though I wouldn't wear them for doing setup & teardown, but they are great for wearing for the actual shows themself. These are comfortable enough to stand in for a few hours, which is not something that I find is always a common thing for platform boots, but these do hold up well.

For sure, they are already the talk of the house.  Once we got past all of the obvious “Frankenstein” dad-jokes, we had to admire and admit that these really are a gorgeous pair of boots.  Compared to similar Goth boots at the so-called chic name stores, these are great quality at a great price.  She’s been looking at similar boots online and in shops that cost three or four times this price and the quality hasn’t surpassed these at all.The platform soles add nearly 2 inches in height (actually 1.77 inches up to 3.15 inches at the heel) and are made of strong rubber.  The toes are rounded.  The boots seem to fit true to size.  My daughter typically wears a 7.5 and these fit accordingly.  She does feel that the slight upturn of the sole at the toe takes a bit of getting used to because she reports that she initially felt as though she was tipping forward.  But she got used to it after walking around for a while.The boots themselves are covered in a slick and shiny faux leather.  I have had shoes made of this before and I do have concerns about scuffing because they are liable to scuff right through the cover sheen, turning a scuff into a damaging scratch.  But since the boots are literally a couple of inches off the ground, the opportunities to scuff should be somewhat less.For a fairly inexpensive pair of boots, these show off well above their asking price and can be worn to just about any teen-aged party or event.  I hope they prove to be durable but I wouldn’t mind paying this affordable price to have a couple of pairs on hand.",4

I like them, but will probably treat them as the costume-jewelry equivalent of shoes. The platforms are thick foam, with the ankle cuff being a bit on the tighter side, even though the shoes themselves are my size. I'd suggest sizing up. The main issue is the strap around the top, it looks as if it can be unbuttoned, it can't and if you try, the grommet will bend with little pressure. I don't expect these shoes to last and you definitely couldn't wear them as an every day boot, BUT I think they are cute and the chains jingling sounds nice when you walk. All of the ""metal"" on these boots would without a doubt tarnish or rust over time. Other than that, I'd recommend investing in a pair of quality boots.",
