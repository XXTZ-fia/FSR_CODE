It’s not real leather of course but still looks nice on and isn’t very cheap looking. Everything is adjustable. I was intimidated at first to figure out how to put it on, but once I located the front and back, you basically put it on like a vest and then wrap the sides around and secure. Each part can be adjusted and it also has little sliders to hold down any extra material so it doesn’t stick out. I would wear this with a cute festival outfit or dress (not what I’m wearing in the photo), but I just love the look of it!",3

It's likely not going to hold up for more than a few wears, and I wouldn't dare to clip or hang anything from it.  The pros are that it looks exactly how I hoped it would and will absolutely work for the event I bought it for. It's extremely adjustable, and I think folks of a lot of sizes would be able to wear this comfortably. It also weighs nothing and is comfy enough, so if I wanted to wear it with a sleeveless/backless shirt or a crop top in warm weather I wouldn't worry about it irritating or leaving indentations on bare skin.  Overall this product is fine. Poor quality, but it looks good.",

I purchased design 2. I am not overweight but I do have curvy hips and a fuller bust. I am thick but I was expecting this to at least wrap around my waist but it did not. I had to add 2 belt extenders to make it fit. I suppose you have to be an American size 0-6 for this to fit properly. I’m a size 10-12. The material is also a bit cheap and it seems to be stapled? It’s also a bit confusing to figure out and it came thrown in a plastic bag all tangled. If you’re anything like me and are interested in the same belt design, I’d suggest looking for a “plus size” harness.",

That doesn't sound like much, but let me tell you...it was a whole process. It looked great when I had it correct, but it should have come ready to wear. Because it's totally adjustable, things were sliding when I was attempting to fix it.  Once on, it looked cute, but the ends kept popping out and sticking up. It isn't structured to hold a shape, so it sat on me rather than gave any support and wasn't flattering. Luckily, I got this to wear one night for a concert, but I had hoped I could use it again... it just isn't made for that. If you're looking at this for more wear than a costume or event, pass on it and buy something better made. If this is just for a one time wear, you can't beat the price.",

It holds up super well to moderate use and is a go to when I feel like my outfits are missing something. I like how it can add a bit of that edgy vibe to even the simplest outfits. My favorite way to style this is over a simple white, fitted button up with some trousers or jeans for work. Fit wise, I'm a 34C bust, 26"" waist and I have to have this on the tightest setting. That means I have a lot of flappy bits towards the end so I have to tie them down, which can be a bit annoying. Like I said, this holds up well and has become a wardrobe staple but I will upgrade to a nicer, real leather version that fits me better when it's time to replace this one.
