Deborah Harris,Just as expected!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AC97B9KTIQUC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJLJNPVY,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 18, 2024",Color: Black 1Size: Large,Verified Purchase,"These are super cute!! I will say though that the opening is pretty tight, as expected, and if you want to wear this higher than right above the knee and have some nice thighs than you’ll definitely need to do some alterations, but other than that they’re pretty great!! The material used for the belts feels a bit plastic-y and the stocking itself uses a thin fabric, but again that was expected!!! It’s nice that they’re so airy actually because I’ve had other thigh highs before and they are kind of delegated for the winter months now because it can get so hot lol, But these will work nicely for the spring and summer!",5
