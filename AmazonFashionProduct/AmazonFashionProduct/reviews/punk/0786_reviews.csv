Even emailed 12 hrs prior to shipping to verify and option to change size before shipping. Now for jacket: very nice, a softer leather then my new leathers, but equal quality. The different shades of studs give it character (like not off assembly line). Nice lining, ever stud is there and secure. The company offers custom sizing but not returnable. So was going for medium cause he measured a bit to small and medium, but I took reviews into consideration and other over seas clothing and squinted ,ordered large.

Upon receiving this jacket I was ""wowed"" by its workmanship and the wonderful smell of leather that filled my nostrils that put a great smile on my face. A jacket that looks so cool with all its studs and spikes. Beautifully made I must say! I always wanted to look cool and feel like a bad ass woman, now I can. Hehe Can't wait for Spring to wear it!!!! Despite all of that, I noticed a few studs missing/broken & a tiny small cut in the leather upon arrival but I did not despair. I notified the seller and he was wonderfully enough to assist me and he granted me a credit for the damage. (Thank you LP-FACON) I kept the jacket despite the broken studs, etc and I will definitely take it to the tailor's once it opens in the Spring to get it fixed. No biggies/no worries!!!! I still love the jacket and I am satisfied with the purchase. Sometimes things happens on transit and we can't control that. There's always a way to go about it without feeling a total despair. Believe me when I say this, ""Wonderful well made Jacket!"" I have my eye set on another jacket to buy! wink wink PS Just one thing I would suggest when it comes to sending orders for customers from afar, is to pack the leather jackets in a box instead of a bag! It will be better secure from transit damages! Thank you.",
Alyx Howlette,Some nitpicks and one important question.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27KXAZH5CD6T3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HHNFSX9,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 3, 2021",Size: XX-SmallColor: Black,,"Now I’ll be honest here. I do very much enjoy this jacket, it’s very nice, fits well, and the leather is of some decent quality. The Patrice for what you’re getting I think is pretty fair. But I do have some nitpicks. One, it seems to have been damaged either at the factory or in transit. I also lack the funds for a return and I actually need it for winter here. Leather is the only thing that seems to do well for me in the winters here, so going another few weeks without just doesn’t seem like an experience I’d like. The other nitpick is that the studs (the circular ones that are mostly flat without any points at all) seem to be a bit exaggerated in the picture and aren't quite what you’ll be receiving. Now lastly I have a question. I would like to know where I can get spare spikes for the jacket since they are screw on. I imagine as often as I’ll be wearing it, I’m likely to lose some. All that being said, I would still recommend buying this jacket. It is very comfortable and worth it.",3

My bf wears XL and it fits him great as a large. I am going to go ahead and keep it rather than return it as I can easily wear hoodies underneath the jacket.",3
