They are all soft, warm, fabrics are as-advertised, brilliant colours, and functional. I bought this one in blue and was surprised (pleasantly) that the logos and designs on the back and arms aren't black or gray, but white. Pockets don't allow your keys, phone, or wallet an easy escape. It's getting cold here, and the hoodie is warm enough for a quick 10-minute walk to the gym in the morning, and it's long enough to cover my backside in my workout clothes once in at the gym. I'm pleased with my purchase. The same item is cheaper on FU's website, but shipping is far more expensive.",

The design looks just like it does in the picture. The outside fabric is solid, very resistant to the elements (wind and rain). The inside fabric is super soft, comfortable and warm. I SIZED UP AND HAVE TO RECOMMEND YOU DO AS WELL. I usually wear an XL, I got a XXL and it fits as well as it can. The Hood is extremely small for my head, not sure if it's the locs or what, but even putting on the hoodie over my head can be a struggle. Because of that it lost 1 star, but other than the hood area everything else is amazing!",14

The M was a perfect fit, just enough extra room without being baggy - I prefer fitted so order up if you want more room. The sweatshirt is a nice med/heavy weight that will keep you warm. Graphics are very clear and well made, no flaky edges or chunkiness that might peel off. Hopefully they hold up to long use and if so, definitely worth the price.",5

I fit in L-XL sizes but the XL does feel similar to a large so keep that in mind. Haven’t washed it yet so will have to see how it holds up.

The Dragon theme of this is incredible and one of the more unique pieces I've seen offered from the company.  I model a lot of Techwear and like to put my own unique twists on them from time to time.  So I am a big fan of another company as well called Bad Dragon (I'm sure a lot of you know what that is lmao), and I thought this hoodie particular was ideal for a Techwear Bad Dragon themed cosplay design.  Hence my attached image was the final result of that idea coming to fruition.  My one thing I need to mention is that the Fabric of the Universe hoodies tend to run slightly smaller than your average USA sized hoodies, or at the very least they're slimmer fit.  I normally wear a USA Medium, but found that it was a bit too tight and needed the Large.  The Large fit me perfectly, so take that information for what you will.  But yeah, definitely recommend this hoodie design for anyone interested in techwear/cyberpunk hoodies.",10

I also didn't really like their vision for the cuffs of their stuff. I think it's a company wide trend too, because I ordered a long sleeve shirt from them and the cuffs were fitted and made it tough to roll your sleeves up. I get that they have artwork on the sleeves, and it's pretty cool artwork, but I should also have the choice to roll them up if I need to get some stuff done.  I still gave them 3 stars because as far as asian streetwear goes, their designs are among the coolest.",
