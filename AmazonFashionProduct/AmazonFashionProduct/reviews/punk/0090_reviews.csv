I've used it with a few different outfits (primarily all crop tops) and it hasn't ever failed to make every single one of them come out as stunning. When I first got it out of the bag I would say than it is a little on the thin-ish side regarding material layers but it isn't incredibly thin either.  Finding the hole as to where your thumb is supposed to go through was a little bit of a conundrum trying to figure that part out but once you do it the first time you've got it down from there.  It definitely fits true to size and id have to say than I was incredibly impressed, I'm extremely happy with the purchase and would 1000% recommend this if anyone is looking for a very cute crop top hoodie, just know than this isn't necessarily a winter Crop top hoodie because of the thinness.",15

I believe this is an ""Amazon knock-off"". What you get has significantly less grommets. The lacing ends just before the start of the hood (in their picture it goes onto the hood). On the sleeves, you only get 4 grommets on each side, their pictures show double that amount. The stitching is also problematic. The laces that come with it you have to lace yourself, and they have no end-caps, meaning they will unravel with use.  Overall, I gave it 4 stars, because it suits my purposes, and I will keep it. It fits me well. I ordered a S, but I am typically an XS, as I am a size 0-1. I am 5'1, and 100 lbs. So, you may want to size up one size. The fabric is soft and stretchy. I do like the feel of the fabric. I bought this for layering purposes in fall, and I think it suits that. It is cute, but definitely a knock-off. I hope my photos help you decide.",19
