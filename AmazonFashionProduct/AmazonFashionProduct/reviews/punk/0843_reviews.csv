She loves the design and the pockets but we were disappointed to discover how thin it was. She is a teen who doesn't like to ware coats and unfortunately this was not the coat substitute we were looking for. She will keep it and has been waring it, just not on the 20 F days. It is slightly over sized, which she likes.",

Mel,Soft and wonderful quality- but looks nothing like the picture,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EOLXHPFYPGQV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBQ7MRH7,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 28, 2024",Color: Black-dSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"Black-d is the incorrect color. It’s more of a bleached reddish brown design instead of the more muted greys and blues depicted on the listing. The design is VERY different too. It looks like a poor attempt to replicate that design. Having said that, the jacket itself is actually super soft and warm and comfortable and well made! Definitely fits me super well as a plus sized person.",

I was pleasantly surprised! I’m usually a medium-large so I got a large. It just fits me, but comfortably. The only real issue that I have personally with the jacket is the seams that connect the sleeve to the torso, that seam on the inside just bugs me a bit lol. Nothing a long sleeve shirt won’t fix underneath!",4

The quality isn’t the same as what is shown in the pictures, it’s a lower quality; however, I don’t mind these inaccuracies and still very much enjoy the hoodie.

One of my new favorite hoodies. Design is exactly as shown plus theres a spine on the back. I would recommend sizing up though. I did because I wanted it to be slightly baggy and it ended up fitting perfect so size may run a bit small,2
Amazon Customer,designs pretty off but it’s thick/warm,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36M4ET6IX10LZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBQ7MRH7,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 16, 2023",Color: Black -Size: Large,Verified Purchase,"i got this in medium and it fits nice but the design isn’t rlly true to the picture bc i thought it would be more faded/darker and not just white (like the photo). i guess it’s ok but the design is also rlly bad and i don’t really like the material, i guess it’s good for colder days? i was expecting it to be thin but i don’t rlly care if ur a person who likes thick jackets. i think it’s just the design that looks kinda weird but overall it’s like 1-2 stars..i don’t recommend buying it tho…(btw the design is smaller irl, idk why it looks bigger in the photo)",7
