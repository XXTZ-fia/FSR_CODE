I’ve had a few faux leggings/pants before. I’ve gone to H&M, Express, etc. They are normally too expensive or they aren’t full faux leather throughout, sometimes a break in the butt or inner thighs. These are full faux leather with a thin fleece line inside to make it easier to get on. The stretch on these are ideal. I bought a Medium. I’m 140ish pounds and 5’2”. Most of that weight is in my butt and thighs. These fit like a glove for me. Maybe had to re-adjust once throughout the night but I was also hosting an event for 300 people. I’ve worn them 3 times now and have gone through the wash, they’ve held up. If something changes in the next few months I will update. I’m sure they will last a decent amount of time but I doubt these will be pants I keep for 6+ years.",5

They were on sale, so I decided to do it.  I got the tan colored leggings.  I am wearing them around the house and have them on now.  I live in a cold climate.  They feel good, but not too warm.  Pretty lightweight, actually.  They seem to stay up well.  They feel good and look good.  I plan to wear them with my brown or black sweaters.  There is an odd smell -- but I think after airing out or giving a quick hand wash, even in Dawn, that will be fine.  They look great.  I am going to have fun with these.  One important note, I have had a seriously broken pelvis for almost 2 years and these work out well and would assume in any hip or leg injury, these would be comforting.",2
