Jennie from the Block,A pleasant surprise!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BD70M2PJH2OS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DPCRVYBD,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025","Color: Western Gold Buckle BlackSize: Fits Waist 32""-37""",,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this. I was slightly concerned that the gold would be too fake looking. While it's bright and shiny, it doesn't look cheap. The faux leather material doesn't feel cheap either. I was in between sizes so I sized up and I wish I had ordered a size smaller as it's a little longer than I had hoped. I like that the open grommets allow me to adjust the size based on how loose or tight I want to wear it so I can make it work.",
Josh B.,Stylish and Quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WGV7C24O8HX1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DPCRVYBD,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025","Color: Western Silver Buckle BlackSize: Fits Waist 32""-37""",,"My wife really likes this belt. This is what she had to say, ""This belt is super cute and trendy. It feels really nice too and not cheap. Follow the chart for ordering the correct size. I wanted more of a waist belt and used those measurements to figure out what size to order. I always say if you're close to two different sizes, order up. This is nice and I think can go with a lit of different styles of outfits as well.""",

A new added touch to my wardrobe. I wasn't really a fan of belts, but this belt definitely made me a fan. The qaulity is excellent, it's well made, and looks super cool on me.",
Consumer,High Quality & Performs as Advertised,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FYVAWJ36ON9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DPCRVYBD,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025","Color: Black With ChainSize: Fits Waist 26""-31""",,"Nice looking belt that is sized for the waist range described. The chain that was included seems cheap and only for decorative purposes, but the belt itself is just what I was looking for. Nice style and good quality for the price.",
Heather_M,Cute & Functional,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16QYN2M6Y5BIZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DPCRVYBD,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025","Color: Black With ChainSize: Fits Waist 26""-31""",,"This is a nice quality belt and a good value for the price. It is a little thinner than I was anticipating, so it can be worn with pants/skirts that have belt loops that are slightly smaller than the usual ones. The chain is a fun accessory and can be completely removed as well.  This belt seems like it is pretty durable. Since the holes go all the way around the belt, it can be cut if it's too big, making sizing much easier. For reference, the belt in my review is a small and the person wearing it wears size 00/0 pants.",
Liz A,So cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQH3EZEI2L8PG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DPCRVYBD,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025","Color: Skinny Gold BlackSize: Fits Waist 26""-31""",,"I absolutely love how blingy this is, I'm wearing over a sweater and it's perfect look, very versatile for jeans or any look.",
James D Whitby,Great looking belt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ISCJ8NEZEY50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DPCRVYBD,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025","Color: Western Studded BlackSize: Fits Waist 32""-37""",,This is a funky looking belt.  I love the studded detail.  It fits true to size.  Definitely get this belt.,
ILoveMyKids,Very cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XFUIREA39ZFZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DPCRVYBD,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025","Color: BlackSize: Fits Waist 26""-31""",,"This belt actually looks nicer in person that I was expecting. It's nice and thick and really stands out - and it's easily adjustable and comfortable to wear. You can really use this to dress up or down as you wish, depending on the outfit and style you want - and it gives off a slightly more edgy look that I like without looking over-the-top. No complaints here - it's well made and looks really great - it gets two thumbs up from me!",
