So much so the poor quality of the leather really started to show and started coming apart. Also bc of all the comments saying the sizing was off I bought the size larger and I’m sorry I did- it was way too big to wear with tight fitting clothes. I advise go with your measurements. All in all it was exactly what I needed it to be, a low key way to check if I wanted to invest in a nicer piece. Do not expect this to stay looking nice if worn regularly",
