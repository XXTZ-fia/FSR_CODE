First the pants have a strange odor on them, maybe from the manufacturer. The pants look nothing like the photo. The belts and zipper are loose and the fit, the fit is bad. I ordered a size small, it's advertised as slim fit and even the photo is slim, but when receiving they are loose. The seat and crouch have a more slouch style, like a heavy diaper. Not good at all. I can't find a way to contact the seller which leaves me having to return for a refund, I'd like to have tried a different size. Maybe they sent the wrong order. Either way, I get my money back, and be cautious when ordering slim fit size small.",

They're not going to last so I'm returning and I suggest you do the same if you already bought. So far, a good brand of jeans on Amazon I like that don't break the bank is a brand named VICTORIOUS and another called GINGTTO. They at least feel somewhat durable and while the GINGTTO's don't have the best zipper either, at least the rest of the jeans hold up and feel good for $35 as of October 2024",3

W,Not a lot of guidance on sizing so I took a guess... slightly too big but manageable...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6UPG43PUJVQH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Z2M4YY6,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 22, 2022",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I really liked the look of these jeans and I liked the price enough to take a risk on sizing even though there wasn't a ton of clarity on the size chart.  For reference, I am about 6'2"" tall, weigh about 185lbs, and normally wear a 32x32 size from Levi's, Dickies, and pretty much every major USA brand of pants. Looking at the size chart and with no other guaranteed reference, I guessed the size marked ""32"" on the left side would get me close if the rest of the measurements corresponded with where I thought they would and, indeed, for the most part, the chart matched. But the 32 (which corresponds to the XX Large size in the menu at time of purchase) is actually closer to a 34 in the waist band. It's not a huge size difference and with a belt it's a non-issue at least for me (and I imagine if you are a ""tuck your shirt in"" kind of person the extra room may be welcome).  But since these are stretchy you could, and I would personally, go one size smaller. I'm probably going to order a second pair one size down that way I'm covered for the fit I want now and then if I get fatter in the future I have a back up.  The fabric is soft and stretchy, they don't feel super heavy duty or anything but seem sturdy enough. They are easy to put on/take off thanks to the stretch and they move well with your legs. I wouldn't go running around doing the splits in them but I imagine that these are as sturdy as your average pair of jeans from H&M, Target, or JCP.  Also, just a note, the frayed areas are indeed frayed through and whatever is underneath so if that's an issue for you (IE, you don't want your skin to show through) you'd need to add some backing fabric behind those areas (on the upper thigh). Not a huge issue but something to be aware of because you can't tell in the pictures if it goes through or not.  Overall, pretty happy with this but if the seller sees this review, a diagram for what areas the measurements on the list correspond to on the pants would be much appreciated for future buyers.  Lastly, the shipping time: These ship from China to a warehouse in California which then ships them on to you. It took 16 days to arrive here in the North East part of the USA.",21
