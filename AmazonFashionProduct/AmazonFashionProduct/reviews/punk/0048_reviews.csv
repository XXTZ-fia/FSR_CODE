I'm about 5'10"" and 190 lbs with a tall torso and short arms, and I bought in an XXL as some reviews suggested purchasing a size up from your normal size. The fit is PERFECT! Seriously, for the money, I did not expect to like this jacket as much as I do. Cuffs stop short just below the wrist, and the length stops right at my belt as it should. Don't get me wrong, the jacket is OBVIOUSLY not leather, but in this fashion world, so many people are walking around with pleather and other faux leather products, nobody's really going to notice unless they're into real leather jackets. The slit pockets on the breasts of the jacket are pretty useless, but seeing as they're never shown to be used in the movies either, I've always assumed they're meant to be cosmetic anyway. There are no handwarmer pockets, true to the movie jacket as well.  In all, coming from somebody who was skeptical about buying a $40 faux leather Wolverine jacket on Amazon, I am completely won over.",7
