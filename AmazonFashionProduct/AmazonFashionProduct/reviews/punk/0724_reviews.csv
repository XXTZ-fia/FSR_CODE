And, for these particular gloves, I would rather they fit close than loose. The finger ends are unfinished, but the seams are sturdy, so I don't feel like they are going to unravel. I was planning to use them for driving and just as a cute accessory, in general. But, I've cosplayed Harley Queen and these bad boys would DEFINITELY meet my cosplay standard.

The colors are rich and they do fit snugly on the hand and don't move much one you have them on. However I have slender but rather long hands and there is a decided lack of give in these gloves. I struggled to get them on and didn't quite have free range of motion in my hand once I did. It wasn't too terrible for me but I know how bony my hands are and I imagine a lot of people will have trouble wearing these. The one size fits all approach to gloves is always rife with issues.  The other troubling thing is just how quickly these gloves started to fray after just an hour or two of wearing. The seams already had some signs of fraying when I got them but the edges along the fingers quickly started to come undone once I was wearing them. All and all I would say these where worth the purchase for me as I was looking to give a little something to my look and these really made everything come together they were fun and I don't regret buying them but I doubt they will hold up to too many wears before they start coming apart and I think the fit is pretty limiting on who can and can't find these wearable so I recommend you weigh your options accordingly before purchase.",3
