This, of course, is not mentioned on the page. I was really excited about this product. I'd learned from past online clothing purchase mistakes, to quadruple-check the interpretation and accuracy of the size chart. I thought it safe to order an XL (US) since my usual size is Large... just in case. Since the size chart said ""XL (US)"", I didn't want to be stuck with an oversized item by ordering a larger size. As it turned out - not unexpectedly, this garment fits like a Medium -- and that might be stretching it (NO pun). I blame myself for this purchase because I'd ordered from companies before with a similar style of clothing at such a good price. I knew better, but chanced it anyway. Also, the garment feels a bit fragile. I'm confused as to how I would wash it without it falling apart or being ruined anyway. The material combination can't really be dry-cleaned. I consider it a lesson learned. No more mail ordering from unfamiliar clothing companies I have no history with, and that have no return policy. I really could've saved the money.",5
