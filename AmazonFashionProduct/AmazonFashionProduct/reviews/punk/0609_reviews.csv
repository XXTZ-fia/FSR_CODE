I am curvy and don't have the tiniest waist or hips so I went with the size 8 and found the fit perfect. The length is a couple of inches above my knees.  This skirt is easy to put on thanks to the zipper closure. It doesn't have shorts under it but the weight is enough that it's not going to go wafting up so much in the breeze. It looks cute paired with thigh highs, fishnets, and other leggings.  It is thick enough to not be seen through yet light enough not to overheat you when worn. The layers and the cut are excellent and it doesn't look or feel cheap.  I wanted to mention it does not come with the belt pictured but there are loops to wear one of your own.
