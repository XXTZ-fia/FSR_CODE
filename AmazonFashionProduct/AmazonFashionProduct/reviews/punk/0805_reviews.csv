Planning to start dating & socializing again wanted something fun, not just a functional belt (as 20 yr one works fine for that).  This is not an “everyday wear” type of belt. The metal accents look cool, however can wear, scratch or tear when sliding into car seats, fabric/leather chairs. The extra width of the metal accents also make this belt not fit if belt loops are tight as the metal accents will not have room to slide through the loop. If you are “fluffy” and have skin that might hang over the edge of the belt, also could experience injury/pinching. Be mindful of these potential issues when belts have any sort of accent, especially metal.  The belt itself looks cool & is true to size.",2

Considering the heavy-looking design of this belt, it’s impressively lightweight, even though the “bullets” feel metallic and plenty solid. My guess is that they’re mostly hollow. The buckle is thick and durable, notching easily into any of the perfectly-spaced, easily-penetrated holes.  The bullets are also spaced evenly and symmetrically, and they cannot be slid out of the faux-leather loops containing them. The thickness of this belt’s faux-leather feels about standard for a belt like this, and it does ripple when creased, so any frequent creases will likely cause the outer layer of the material to begin to separate and peel up, as is common with such belts and such a material. I love the look of this belt overall, as it incorporates perfectly into my wardrobe, and I feel that its quality fits the price.",3

Falling a bit into the punk/metal space, I opted for the bullet belt. It does feel somewhat on the light side, as I suppose it would being made of vinyl or PU or whatever, and the bullets are plastic, but I imagine this is about the quality you would get from the mall subculture store, so no major complaint there. Major complaints on the sizing being like 4-5 inches off. I chose the size I would be in the middle-to-lower end of, so that I might have room to tighten it. Instead, I am at the last loop. Kinda annoying! Size up! Or don't buy it, whichever, I assume these are a dime a dozen.",

I went off the size chart, but didn't realize they meant natural waist, like high up waist, and I don't know a single soul who has ever worn these high up on their natural waist. Not only that, I figured 32 inches maximum would leave ample room to wear it lower on my hips (my waist is about 27 inches) - it still sits really high up even at the largest hole, more like 29 inches max. I would suggest sizing up if you want to wear it lower around your waist because they maximum length is not accurate for the available holes. It will be fine for my costume ultimately (or I'll find someone smaller who can wear it), but the quality is pretty cheap (fake leather) and it is very stiff and ""fresh out the factory"" feeling. Definitely only good for a costume - would not recommend as a daily wear item due to the obvious cheapness of the materials. Thankfully all studs were present and accounted for at least!",5
