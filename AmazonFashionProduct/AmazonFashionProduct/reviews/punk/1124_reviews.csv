ChrisL,These run short,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28HHKLMZGHW60/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3XW82W1,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 5, 2024",Size: MediumColor: A10 Black,,"These pants look a little darker and less textured in person. They also are pretty tight and don't sit around my ankle, higher than the picture shows. They also are not that baggy. This is all before the was so they are likely going to shrink. I would recommend getting a size up. Also the 'straps' don't really do much and just sort of swing around when walking. The quality seems pretty good though.",
