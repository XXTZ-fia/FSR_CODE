They’re stretchy but very tight - size medium. I followed the advice of some reviewers who are a similar height to me but a bit heavier in weight and suggested a 4x. I’m typically a size 6 / S/M in coats and jackets. The 4x is way too big. Possibly 3 sizes too big so I’m going to try an XL. Unlike motorcycle jacket styles, this is meant to be a bit more fitted. Of course size up if you’ll be layering over chunky sweaters, etc. but at 6’1” 155 lbs I think the XL will be a perfect. 🤞🏼 And I’ll update! In terms of the jacket itself, it’s RAD!!! Doesn’t feel super cheap or like the studs are going to fall right off. And it doesn’t smell funny :)",

I love the look and will keep it but do I feel like it was worth the buy? Not really, but it was needed for a special occasion, and it was easier to keep it than return it. It’s priced about twice the value of its quality so let’s take off the rose-colored glasses and talk about the cons. The leather is fake and plastic feeling. I can tell it won’t last long overall if not treated gently but it looks really good. The spikes are also fake. There are around 350 chrome-dipped plastic spikes. They’re light-weight and might break off if hit too hard on something so don’t brush up against stuff but they look like they won’t come loose on their own. Be cautious of rubbing the studs because the chrome layer will rub off. I can see the white seems of the plastic on a couple of them.  This is quality costume wear that is sturdy enough for several careful wear applications but don’t expect this to be sturdy enough for casual or daily wear. This jacket should be purchased for special occasions only. Not good for a drunken evening of wall-flowering. It will catch on things, rip, and the spikes will break or chrome will rub off. The zipper is cheap but everything looks really good. The fit is nice and it’s really lightweight considering all the hardware, I was expecting a much heavier jacket. I don’t feel totally swindled but I do feel like the post should be more clear about the quality. Would not buy again for that reason.",31
