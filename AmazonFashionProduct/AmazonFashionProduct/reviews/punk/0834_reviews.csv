Zachary T. King,No hood on ‘hoodie’?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYH1L2I5JP08N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P2WB9JD,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 27, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"At the time of my purchase (and looking at it now) the title of this item says “hoodie”, so between that and the hood in the model pics I thought there was a hood attached/tucked in at the collar. There’s not.  Love the material, good fit, but not what I thought I was getting based on the title and model photos.",

It tore under the arm but I have since sewn and mended it. I recommend reinforcing under the arms inside the seam with a little super glue.",

This turned heads for sure, I love the design and the material is high quality water resistant too.",

It’s nice but that fresh paint plastic smell is intense.,

Token,Good quality durable yet light weight,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PO3TTS0GL3BN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P2WB9JD,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 21, 2022",,Verified Purchase,I'm 6'1 240 so the second pic is to show the length. be careful if you're a large guy because the range of motion in the under arm can cause tension that could tear a seem. I wear it when I ride and love the fact that the back has enough room to cover my backpack (superdry),2
Beezy,Dont buy this product,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1F3YQTM6T0TIG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P2WB9JD,"1.0 "," the United States "," June 19, 2022",,Verified Purchase,Dont get me wrong. This product looks cool and could be functional but its not.  Why buy a product that rips a little tiny bit every time you try and put it on?  Ps. I am almost the exact same dimension as the they used.,
Leeleez,"The concept is neat, but the heavyweight is not for me.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31P5VXXRLQ3RW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P2WB9JD,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 26, 2022",,Verified Purchase,"I'm a 5'2 female and about 140 lbs. Take this review with a grain of salt, this might be a lot better on someone with a bigger figure...  I only ordered the heavy weight because the lighter weights were not in stock, and I really liked the concept of these jackets. The heavy weight is basically a weighted raincoat, and even with as a nice outfit it looks rather silly because of its material and size. Not to mention, when I put my arms out in front of me, the jacket puffs out by a lot and makes me look more silly. Don't get this unless lighter weights are in stock, or if you don't want your friends to ask if you're about to go into airsoft warfare.",2

A+ for quality and construction. The material is waterproof and not weak/thin. Inside seams are properly tapered and not exposed. Fit is a bit wide, but that is for aesthetics to create a thin silhouette of your torso in contrast to your top.  Negative 1 star because this garment isn't functional. It looks like an athletic top, but if you were to actually use it for anything active it would probably rip just due to how it is designed (mainly for looks).",

It actually looks insane ! The quality is amazing ! I wish it hugged my body better doe ... but none the less ! It actually is very cool and looks futuristic ! I put on an arm sleeve to complete the look .,
