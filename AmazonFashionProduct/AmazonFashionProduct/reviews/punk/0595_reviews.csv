They are so comfortable as far as casual shoes go. The color in the picture is pretty accurate and they are canvas so they're not really that easy to clean, but the color hides dirt well. These shoes seem to get better with age if I'm being honest. They look better after some wear. This review is asking to provide information on slip resistance and I would NOT advise you get them if you need anything slip resistant. Use your brain, TBH you shouldjust know what shoes you can and can't wear in slippery conditions.",

They're not wide wide but I can't seem to fit comfortably in many a shoe. They are wide enough for me, and pleasantly spacious in the toe.Anyway, I'm keeping them because I bought a ""used"" pair which brought the price way down.  I don't want to give them up for a smaller pair at the full price.  They are too cute to part with. Instead, I tightened up the straps a little so my feet don't slide and I'm good to go.If they come out with another color, like dark pink or a worn blue jean color, or a fatigue green I'll confidently order another pair in my correct size.",12

Somebody came up to me to ask if my shies were Rocketdog shoes. I thought it was really neat that people knew what they were the moment they saw them.  I think it's how distinct the soles are on the shoes.  Its not so different that it makes the shoes ""loud"" just unique enough to get noticed.  They're really easy to keep clean and they're really comfortable to wear. The soles inside are very soft and comfortable and I put these shoes through a lot of wear and tear Already in the couple months that I've had them. They still look brand new! I am so happy with the value and style and comfort of these shoes, I went ahead and bought a pair of ankle type boots from Rocketdog. I expect good things but I'll be sure to let you know!",6
