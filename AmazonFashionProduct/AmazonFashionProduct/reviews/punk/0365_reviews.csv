Not tight in the arms at all. Very soft. You have to wear something under it. I'm 5'7 165 lb and it's worth the price but I don't want to take a picture.,
Karin B,Loved the shirt but…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YLWM9EBUV27W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CL4CJRXL,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 27, 2024",Color: 2-blackSize: One Size,Verified Purchase,It fit the style and was my size but it literally ripped first wash lol.

It’s really comfortable and made very well. Regardless of all the tears, I wasn’t cold at any point wearing this shirt. The reason I gave it a four instead of a five is because I didn’t realize just how see-through it is, and it is very difficult to put on your fingers will keep getting caught in the little  Openings . But overall, I would definitely recommend this sweater.",

Soft comfy but the size is off it feels uncomfortable to wear. It might just be because im a bit chubby but the arms made me stressed.,

I took the risk, however, and it fits surprisingly well. I will say, this is meant to be somewhat oversized so it will fit a lot of people, but will look slightly different on various body types",

I was wrong. This is for my plus size girlies. I am 5’3, 192lbs with an hourglass shape. This hits the cut off right at my waist, it doesn’t pinch or feel tight on my arms and it is EXTREMELY flattering. New favorite shirt? About to wash it for the first time - I’ll update if that goes poorly. Otherwise? 6 out of 5 stars.",13

Jordan,One Size is a bit subjective,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDJKIXT6FXI28/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CL4CJRXL,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 20, 2023",Color: 2-blackSize: One Size,,"when items of clothing are one size fits all, it gets me a little worried. I did have a small problem with the arms not exactly fitting, I am 5 feet tall 8 inches for reference and weigh around 140 pounds. I am done growing for my age, and this one size didn’t exactly fit in the right places. It was baggie around my waist, Botella on my shoulders and tight around my wrists. Also, there is fraying of the seams and I had thread coming off of the shirt. I know it was intentional to have holes in the top, but they were also small plastic pieces of tags that was left on the shoulders, or as the item arrived inside out it looked.",
A.,"Short, small but very creative and cute",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REWOF5P7GK6HA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CL4CJRXL,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 9, 2023",Color: 2-blackSize: One Size,,"Top itself is super cute and seems well made (just be careful you don't snag it in a million places, put jewelery on after). It's quite short and didn't fit on me like it does on the model, it's just very short on the torso. As soon as you lift your arms up, it's going over and exposing everything under, so be aware. I have long arms and this came close to the wrist but a little short. It's somewhat boxy/square from the side, if you do not have a large chest this might be more noticeable. This only comes in one size, so you get that it is, wish I could have done one size up and then it probably would have sat better on my body or been lower to actually cover my chest lol. Beyond that though it's very cute and pretty and gothic. I wore the bright blue tank to clearly show the fit of the shirt.",10
