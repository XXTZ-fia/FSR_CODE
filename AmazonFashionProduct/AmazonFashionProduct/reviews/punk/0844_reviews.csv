Andrew,Arrived earlier than expected!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R331VE4XFMY6MA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CD7NDT21,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 26, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I usually wear a large, but I ordered an XL because I was unsure. It fits me perfectly! If you have a curvier body type, it may feel a bit snug, but I personally like how the material is not thin at all. However, if you are expecting a loose and baggy hood, this may not be the right product for you. The stitching in some areas is a little wonky but this is better than I expected!",3

Wilson TNT,There is nothing oversized about this hoodie,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1B173Q21F1F3H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CD7NDT21,"1.0 "," the United States "," May 2, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"It arrived and was a completely different pattern. It was black and white stiped, but the ears were narrow and sad not whimsical amd fun. The whole fit was different, basically just a normal dad hoodie fit. Ends at the top of your hips with normal,tightish fitting sleeves and sad long thin ears tacked on top. If it was returnable it would have been returned.",6
