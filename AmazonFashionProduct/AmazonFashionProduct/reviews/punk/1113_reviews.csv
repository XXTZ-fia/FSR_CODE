I felt this style top was perfect for what I was going for.  Loved and preferred the off shoulder sleeves as I felt it added a little sexiness to it. The cuffed sleeves were nice as it added color and were able to be as tight or loose as you wanted. The only thing I did not like is that it had a tendency to ride up a little the more I moved resulting in me having to readjust from time to time. If not, the top went a little too high up on the chest as well as the bottom feeling like it wasn’t down low enough. Overall, I’m pleased with it.",

CrazyCatLady,Should have sized up. “Leather” on Sleeve doesn’t stretch.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11DTMQUR8W6PF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07DN8WJSC,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 16, 2022",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I bought a size Large, but definitely should have gone up a size, if only because I think it would have fit better around my arms, and been a bit longer. (The “leather” cuff was a bit tight). I’m 5’2”, about 160. Busty, & with a larger than needed waist, and less than toned arms. (LOL).  To wear a corset belt with it, and have shirt material sticking out below, a larger shirt would have been better for me.  THAT SAID… if you have a larger chest, don’t mind the length, and your arms are more toned, you could still wear a Large. (Assuming you’re short & thicker like me). It’s stretchy material. Also, because the leather on the arms is tighter, it helps keep the top of the shirt down over the shoulders, like most would want to wear it anyway.  *I washed with dark colors on Delicate, and let it air dry. No shrinkage.",26
