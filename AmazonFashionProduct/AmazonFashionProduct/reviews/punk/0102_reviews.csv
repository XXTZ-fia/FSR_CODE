Amazon Customer,Not for petite people,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FTONET6TT52U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BQ72TTVK,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 25, 2023",Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"I'm about 5'1 100lbs and this harness has a huge amount of extra room and length to the straps. The holes stop several inches short of where I need them to and have to be folded back in on themselves to not be flopping around everywhere.  For people 120lbs+ I would imagine this harness fits perfectly and is super sexy, but it's making me feel like a child who got into my older sister's closet. Luckily I got this for a Halloween costume, and the material is cheap enough I imagine it will be fairly easy to punch extra holes in and modify to look less ridiculous on me.",3

I'm not confident it will stay together, a few grommets came off and the material is a kind that has let me down numerous times in the past. Very disappointed in this item as I wanted to use it for so many outfits",

Daniel Walz,"Nice, but complicated",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7RSIVM137FP7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BQ72TTVK,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 7, 2023",Color: Black,,"The Women High Waisted Belt Punk Rock Belts offer a bold and edgy accessory choice that adds a unique flair to your ensemble, earning a solid 4-star rating from me.  The high-waisted design and punk rock aesthetic make this belt a standout piece for those seeking to make a statement. It's clear that it's designed to be a festival body chain and rave accessory, perfectly suited for individuals looking to showcase their style at lively events.  However, I've assigned a 4-star rating due to the complexity mentioned. While the look is undoubtedly captivating, the intricacies of wearing and adjusting the belt might require some effort and time. This could potentially impact the ease of use, particularly for those who prefer more straightforward accessories.  In summary, the Women High Waisted Belt Punk Rock Belts provide an attention-grabbing and daring accessory choice for festivals and rave events. The high-waisted design and punk rock vibes make it a versatile statement piece. While the complexity of wearing it might require a bit more attention, the overall impact and unique aesthetic are commendable. A 4-star rating reflects its distinctive style and the consideration of its wearability complexities.",3
