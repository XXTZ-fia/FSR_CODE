Jenny,Very nice for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JGISXVYZWGZD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9Y52Y2T,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 25, 2024","Color: BlackSize: Fit for Waist Size 28''-32""",Verified Purchase,I do not buy belts easily. Usually they simply don’t suit me. This belt was necessary to replace one I love but broke. This one is almost Exactly the same in look and texture. Loved the price.,
Rachel Hill-Arrington,Great value for the money,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JDLIF1JJ8FL3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9Y52Y2T,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 17, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Fit for Waist Size 33''-36'',Verified Purchase,Love it!,
Hypnoglitter,As pictured,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2J8CZMB1EY9A5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9Y52Y2T,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 10, 2024","Color: BlackSize: Fit for Waist Size 28''-32""",,This belt is as pictured. It is NOT real leather (I prefer fake so that's fine with me). It is a perfectly acceptable belt for the price - it's not high end but it looks good when wearing it. Recommend if you need a black belt that has a bit of interest but won't overwhelm an outfit!,
itemquest,Nice belt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RHC6FXP6U1ZN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9Y52Y2T,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 22, 2024","Color: BlackSize: Fit for Waist Size 28''-32""",,Not quite as shiny as I was expecting. The studs are a bit understated. I love that the backside is sueded like a good quality real leather belt (even though this isn't real leather!),
RAD,Love this,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KFYWMC4MBAM8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9Y52Y2T,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 15, 2024","Color: BlackSize: Fit for Waist Size 28''-32""",,"I love the look of this.

SarahBeth Carter,Timeless and Stylish Belt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10SZ5FKDVNOZ6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9Y52Y2T,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2024","Color: BlackSize: Fit for Waist Size 28''-32""",,"This black embossed leather belt is a perfect everyday staple! The studs are subtle, giving it a timeless look compared to the oversized studs trending right now, but it still adds a fun, edgy vibe to my outfits. The length is just right—I'm a size 28 in jeans, and it fits perfectly. Definitely a cute and versatile addition to my wardrobe!",
Bleubelle,Embossed Belt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R3EM2FN9BXTZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9Y52Y2T,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 28, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Fit for Waist Size 37''-40'',,This high quality embossed studded leather belt almost feels like real leather. It's soft like real leather.  I'm impressed with how well made this belt looks and feels. It features a real metal buckle and real metal studs. The embellished vines design are classic casual. The belt fits true to size just follow the size chart and you'll be fine. This belt has a nice weight and thickness to it like a way more expensive belt. It also easily fit the loops of my jeans. Sometimes it's a issue when belts are too large for jean loops and don't lay flat. This is not that kind of belt it fits and lays flat! This is also a comfortable belt and the holes line up with the pin so I don't have to add any holes. This is just a really nice belt.,
Edmo,As expected - appropriate length and quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RY1U6KXWAG8NF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9Y52Y2T,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 28, 2024",Color: BrownSize: Fit for Waist Size 37''-40'',,"This belt was just as I expected - it's faux leather, so not sure how long it will last, but it's a nice belt.  Under-stated brown color, with touches of imprint accents and studs that stand out just a bit, but not too much.  Overall, I look forward to wearing this either at my waist or below, with pants or dresses/skirts that need a bit of attention or cinching at the waist.  Good purchase at $14.99.",
Ginnie Reads,Like the design of this belt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31HSTSQAG8GXX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9Y52Y2T,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 28, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Fit for Waist Size 37''-40'',,I got his belt because I liked the embossing on it. I’ve used it a few times and feel that it’s durable and a great quality belt. I like the design and look of it. The little studs and embossed design gives any outfit a nice touch. I noticed it gives my fall outfits a cuter look. Sometimes something as simple as a belt can really add pizzazz to an outfit. Highly recommend this.  I’ll update this review if anything changes.,
Susan F.,Great versatility!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JX80VOQOYO8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9Y52Y2T,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Fit for Waist Size 33''-36'',,I got this belt based on their sizing chart and it was spot on. It has a very light imprint on it and the studs and buckle are understated so you can wear this belt with any type of outfit. I’m very happy with the width also because I am short waisted at 5’3” and that can make a huge difference in the look.,
Danielle Mead,Shorter than expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TMU74CY425BS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9Y52Y2T,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 23, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Fit for Waist Size 37''-40'',,"This is a very nice belt and I like the look of it. I went by waist size and it was a little shorter than I wanted. Normally I expect that the belt will fit through at least one loop, but mine barely fit even though my waist size was on the low end of the range that I ordered. I suggest getting one size larger than you think you need.",
