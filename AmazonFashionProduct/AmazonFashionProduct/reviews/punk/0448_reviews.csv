The belt wasn't over-tightened or abused.  Original review: My husband recently whittled his waist size from 36 to 34 and badly needed a new belt to go with his new jeans. I showed him this one, never noticing it says it's for women, and he loved the looks. Once it arrived, he loved the fit, too.  It's a bit narrower (still on the wide side as a woman's belt) than his usual belts, meaning he can use it with pants that aren't wide-looped jeans when he wants. It fits his jeans loops just fine. The silver parts are inexpensive but they look good, and the leather belt itself is nicely tooled.  The belt is the correct length, as advertised. We're very happy with it.",
