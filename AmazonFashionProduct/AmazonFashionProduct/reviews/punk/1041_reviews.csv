Julia12,Love them,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAD1QVW73NZE3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTSG8S34,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 11, 2023",Style: Punk Style,,I really like these bracelets. They fit great and are comfortable to wear. The metal doesn't irritate the skin or dig into either. One of the bracelets looks like 3 individual bracelets but it's not its actually connected. For some reason I didn't notice that when I was looking at the listing. It's not a deal breaker or something.  The quality of these are alright. I don't know how long these will last if tou wear them a lot. They are kinda thin as well.,

Hope,Like that they are stackable and can be worn separately. Not high quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DPM3QM71AD0P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTSG8S34,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 23, 2023",Style: Classic Style,,"I got these for my teenage daughter who is very into this style and she was very excited. She said they fit her comfortably and and she was happy she could wear them either all together or on both wrists if she so chooses. I tried them on before I gave them to her and and I liked the fit.  The bracelets each have three snaps for size adjustment which is nice for gift giving and comfort.  I would say, they are not super high quality, like when I remember buying the leather and studded jewelry from Hot Topic as a teen, I remember there being weight and quality to the pieces... these are not them. So for something I guess more costume and less quality this would be the choice.  They are reasonably priced for what You receive.  But if You are hoping for something sturdy and that will stand up to long and daily wear, I would not choose these. Good for costume or occasional wear, for anything more I'd say keep shopping. 3 stars",2

They're more edgy. I especially like the one with the spikes. I think people with smaller wrists might find these are too big for them.

They were also pretty much as expected after they arrive. They're not real leather or anything, but they give you a bit of the look of it and definitely add some flare to your look for the day.  They remind me a lot of something I would have wanted to wear growing up but that my mother would have let me have over her dead body -- a very good thing, I assure you. In other words, I've had a lot of fun with them. They're comfortable, too, so you can't go wrong. Definitely give these a try if you like punk-style or 80s-influenced accessories.",

They are edgy and not too bulky. The three different options can be worn on multiple occasions. They are sitting in my trinket dish at the moment, but I have worn them a few times since buying and haven’t noticed any issues. Definitely for anyone who is also in the alternative scene for sure!",

You could probably find a better sturdier set at a hot topic these feel so light and cheap. But they'll give you the look you're going for. I did wear the biggest one for a few days, almost a week and it held up ok, and the snaps for the record are legit, had to pull really hard to get the bracelet off. So maybe it's just a preference of mine, and they aren't as cheap as I think they are.",
