If you want a choker don't get the ones with snappy buttons. I would take a picture but unfortunately I threw mine away which I will say why in a bit. I bought the choker simply for show and nothing more, if you feel like you want a choker for OTHER reasons I recommend one that has an actual buckle. But anyways- I get buckled chokers as well however they're spendy. This choker is cute and my boyfriend liked it as well. But unless you plan to wear this in water or keep it for a very long time I say you shouldn't. Get a different color instead just in case it gets especially wet. A solid color is best. I strongly recommend not to get the holographic filmed version of this choker because after accidentally getting it wet the film started to peel off. And I tried peeling the rest off to have a plain white one but it didn't work out too well. Anyways, I'm sure if you wear the choker a lot the same thing will happen anyways. Even though snap on chokers like these are cheap, holographic film covered ones are probably way cheaper. Giving it 4 stars because it was still cute though :) so If you want to get the holographic version, don’t wear it too much and don’t get it wet.",3
