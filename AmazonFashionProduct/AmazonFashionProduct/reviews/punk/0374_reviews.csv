Scorpion,Great cyberpunk add-on lighting effects,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MIXD1R63JOK0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFGF3QWH,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Style: Style-b,,Got this to cosplay cyberpunk for Halloween. This looks amazing on my cyberpunk helmet. I also really like the different lighting effects which I could change based on different costumes.,
Sean,Cheap but work,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1L731TZZGII60/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFGF3QWH,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Style: Style-c,,"They wiggle a surprising amount within their housing, and I'm not confident they will keep working for very long, probably not the best for a keychain as they will likely break sooner then later.  If you're going to be dangling them from somewhere that shouldn't be seeing daily use and wear and tear, they should work great.",
ChrisL,Looks really cool!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30WJ4SNUH67M1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFGF3QWH,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 28, 2024",Style: Style-d,,"It comes with two keychains and lights up well. They are accurate to the description and pictures. I haven't had them lit extensively but the charge has lasted for 1-2 months so far (albeit with little use). It doesn't state this but you need to hold down to turn the light on/off, and then you can click through the single colors and flashing options. Overall is a good deal!",
Adele,Pretty great,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KPH4UIQ0TABY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFGF3QWH,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 22, 2024",Style: Style-c,,Love these,
Gabriella White,Dope as hell flashy lighty sticks!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WT65DPQMPPP5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFGF3QWH,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 9, 2024",Style: Style-a,Verified Purchase,"These are super cool and I came here to make that announcement. I love how bright they are and all their color modes. I've been using them both when I'm outdoors and as ambient lighting. I even thought it was a fun idea to fit it in one of my ear piercings which looks rad btw. I know it's not their intentions but they are pretty light too so it checks out. Thank you, these are pretty well made and I love the fact that I don't have to go out and buy batteries but charge them for every night's use instead. I love them :)",
Pedro Delgado,So cool!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LB1NEXQ2QMTD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFGF3QWH,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 24, 2024",Style: Style-d,,"These LED accessories are perfect for my sci-fi cosplay. I used them for a photo shoot to go along with my helmet and they were perfect. They have a bunch of colors that they switch through and flashing pattern.  They come with batteries too. The text, material, all of it is very clear and I really like them.",
DeeDee,Nice cyberpunk accents,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VB7XD1WLYADC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFGF3QWH,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2024",Style: Style-b,,"These are really nice accessories to keep in the game room while playing cyberpunk or shadowrun type tabletop RPGs.  They are large and look great, with nice vibrant colors when turned on.  They make great fidgets for my players during our game sessions that allow them to get a little extra bump of game immersion.",
Elikathal,Great accessories,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KUGNANQJ27ZP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFGF3QWH,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 20, 2024",Style: Style-b,,"Exactly as pictured, great color options, can be used as zipper pulls or just hanging accessories.

Sidney Tsai,"Hesitant 5-star, but 5-star nonetheless.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KOW2HI0ZJRHO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFGF3QWH,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 4, 2024",Style: Style-d,,"1. Overview and First Impressions  It looks awesome. I can't say I dislike the cyberpunk vibes and the attention to detail on the printing is also pretty good.  Most of all, it does what it says on the box, and looks pretty good. So, it wouldn't feel justified to dock it a star for not doing what it doesn't advertise. That said, there are a number of things this product could do better.  2. Adherence to Advertisement  It's as advertised, almost to a T. It doesn't go above and beyond, but it's not below par either. The product images are accurate and truthful, though I wish it was a little more descriptive.  3. Product Features and Execution  The product comes with an identical set of two chains, and two Micro-Usb chargers. They look good and they feel sturdy.  The printing on the acrylic is probably liable to be damaged with very heavy use, but even spot testing with my fingernail, I couldn't scrape it off. I would say I'd expect it to last a good while.  The battery is also surprisingly decent. The light has an automatic shutoff when the battery nears zero; It lasts more than two hours at full charge. However, I'm also not a fan of micro-usb charging, especially for such a futuristic product. How can I feel like I'm in 2077 when I'm using a charger from 2010?  4. Pros - Looks cool and as advertised - Pretty durable and sturdy construction  5. Cons -Lowish battery life -Microusb recharging  6. Final Thoughts and Recommendation  So mostly, I wish the micro-usb and the battery life were depicted in the advertisement. However, this is definitely a ""you get what you see"" product, and I think the coolness factor makes up for its faults.",
Somekindofsam,Great addition to any cyberpunk look,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EP6YK8BZOCPI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFGF3QWH,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 29, 2024",Style: Style-b,,Cool colors!

Gabriella Hardy,Fun pendants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RW7P2NOKJ6FI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFGF3QWH,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 27, 2024",Style: Style-b,,These are fun light up Cyberpunk style pendants. I was unhappy that they didn't comes with any instructions to turn them on. I finally figured out that you need to hold the button down to turn them on and off.,
