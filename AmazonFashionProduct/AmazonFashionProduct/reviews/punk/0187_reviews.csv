This top pairs well with pants or skirts, and I would only change the ties on the back. Instead of a black shoestring, a leather or silk-like ribbon would look or pair better. I replaced mine with a silk-like ribbon I had on hand, but it will need to be replaced with a longer string to try to tie it myself. I will be returning to Charmian's for my future needs.",

My plan is to order some lace to see if i can make it wider just a bit to be able to fit it as i need it in a couple weeks to be ready and thats ok.

The corset is laced in a way that you can loosen and tighten yourself while wearing (my favorite thing since I was not expecting it) The material is so good and while it does cinch, you can easily leave room for a food belly and normal breathing without losing the hourglass shape. I loved being able to zip myself into it and THEN adjust the laces. The zipper came apart when I first used it and simply put the plastic end back the zippper track and zipped back down, fixed it no problem. Otherwise, I would highly recommend.

I have bigger hips and went in knowing I'd need to add hip gores to it but I can't because of where the zipper is located.  The cute bolero top part has a funky fit. The shoulders are not broad enough for the XL size and it bunches under the armpits because of that.  My biggest gripe is the boning. It's not spiral steel, it's a flimsy plastic. It will still make a cute addition to my costume but there is no way it will give any waist reduction even if there was enough room in the hips. But honestly what did I expect for the price? I'm just disappointed there is not a good way to fix it without major alterations.  Again, very pretty but the fit and construction are lacking. I'm 40-33-42",
