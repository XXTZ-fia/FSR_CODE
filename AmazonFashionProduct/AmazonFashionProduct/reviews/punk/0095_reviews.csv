Smelled so strongly of cigarettes. Old and stale. It would have been impossible to clean the smell out. Return process was painless.  Material is cheap. You’ll not get but one or three good wears. Great costume piece if you don’t mind the foul scent of your great uncle that smoked in his house for twenty years.,

"Lauren ""Lala"" Peacock",Not Great for Wide Underbusts,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35BQL023R75SI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C9NR4Z4M,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 11, 2023",Color: CoffeeSize: XX-Large,,"This underbust “corset” belt is made of a soft and supple faux leather, and a super thick and stretchy elastic. Even though it has a snap back, its stretchy enough to pull on over your head if you want. It has 2 adjustable straps that buckle in the front, and a lace up detail.  I have a 38” waist, so I ordered the XXL, and even though it was not tight (the elastic is very stretchy) the underbust dips did not align properly with my underbust. I ended up having to unlace the front about 2in for a more flattering look where the dips in the corset actually sat where my underwire. I wish I could keep it fully laced, but it just looked awful on me that way, so I suppose im thankful that the lacing is functional and not just decorative. If you have a wide set or ""shallow"" bust consider the fit and size accordingly.  I will probably use this as a layering piece for renaissance faire costumes.",15

Shirley,"Not boned, no underwire, and buttons aren't ideal",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP05F7LU51MUO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C9NR4Z4M,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 20, 2023",Color: CoffeeSize: Large,,"The product is pretty average. It looks good enough, but be warned: you'll get what you paid for. The quality isn't the worst but it's also not the best. You can clearly see in the product images that the straps show a distinct line where the pleather is folded over and stitched together. The pleather in the rest of the ""corset"" is soft, but also pretty light/thin even compared to other items I've gotten at a similar price range.  Honestly, I wish item naming was stricter in the sense that something shouldn't be allowed to be called a corset, but rather ""corset-style"" when it doesn't have boning. As an underbust ""corset"" this doesn't even have underwires, which results in the middle flipping/squishing down instead of sitting between your boobs. Is boning (or even just underwires!) really that expensive or difficult to build in? OR at least make the ""fabric"" thicker/more rigid where the boning/underwire should be so that it appears more solid when you wear it.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it also sits a little too high, but I was able to pull it down to the right height after re-adjusting the straps.  HOWEVER: one other gripe is that instead of using a zipper, it uses snap buttons. Mine didn't have any issues with falling off, but the snap isn't very tight so when I was putting it on it would un-snap itself... I had to go from the top down and be VERY careful not to pull too hard so that the ""done"" buttons wouldn't undo themselves.  I'll probably wear this a few times, but I may end up throwing it in a donate pile in a year for someone else to pick up as a costume piece.",3
Poverty All-Natural Shopper,"Flattering. Nice Fit. Good Hardware, But Color-Matching Issue. Flimsy-Feeling Faux Leather.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R5JKOD1WET5U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C9NR4Z4M,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 19, 2023",Color: BlackSize: Small,,"For reference, I’m an eccentric Goth that typically wears a teen size S or XS and a 32B bra, I’m 5’4, 115 pounds, and I have the Theatrical Romantic Kibbe body type. I ordered this underbust corset belt in a size S in the color “Black.”  The front arrived pre-laced, but the straps were unbuckled and flailing loose, so you’ll have to align those. On my petite frame, buckling the shoulder straps at the tightest available hole has them fitting me perfectly. Anyone with a shorter torso than my own might need to add some extra buckle holes. 4 holes remain for anyone taller, which I suspect is plenty. Fastening this in the back using the single column of 3 nice snaps, this secures snugly enough around my waist to highlight my curvy silhouette, but a tighter fit wouldn’t hurt my feelings. The elastic band in the back is extremely stretchy, so I’m sure even this size S can accommodate a pretty good range of waist sizes. This sits perfectly under my bust and frames my small breasts nicely. I’m not disappointed with the excellent aesthetic contribution of this belt.  All of the hardware is pretty good, all the way down to the laces and their silvery, metal tips. While I greatly appreciate those metal tips to prevent lace fraying, it would have been nice if their color matched all the other brassy hardware.  The faux-leather material is not the best. It feels very delicate, like a fingernail scratch could damage it. While I could be wrong, I wouldn’t expect this material to hold up for very long before cracking and peeling. The thinness of this material is most noticeable in the shoulder straps, which feel incredibly flimsy, almost like they could snap.  Overall, I think this is a nice-looking and flattering belt that is hindered greatly by its seemingly low-quality faux leather. It complements my style beautifully regardless, so I’m happy to add it to my wardrobe.",

The belt is true to the size chart (I am a size 10, ordered the large) but also highly adjustable due to the laces.  The snaps make it easy on/off once you get the laces right.

Really like this brand and have a lot of other pieces from them, so I'm hoping this was just a one-off. I have another similar belt from them that works great and this one is made well, otherwise.
