First of all, the thing that actually really upsets me, is the fact the studs are not riveted in like the description said. They are sewn on. Very poorly sewn on. They aren't even metal. They are metallic plastic.  That jacket as a whole feels like a costume store kind of jacket. I have seen fake leather jackets that sell for less with more weight behind them.  If I knew I would get this kind of poor quality from a fake leather jacket. I should of just bought a legit leather one that HWK sells and just took the time to stud it myself. Which I might do if my niece hates this jacket like I do. I feel ashamed of myself thinking this was a steal. The only thing stolen from me is my sense of trust from a company that lies and misrepresents their clothing.",5
