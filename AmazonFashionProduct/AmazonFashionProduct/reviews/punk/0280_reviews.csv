Straps are approximately an inch wide, material is pliable and not at all rigid. It’s nothing sturdy but quite acceptable for fashion use and comfortable. It’s got room to spare (10” plus extra on the waist straps and I’m a size 18/20). I’m going to glue the strap keepers in place because they slide freely but other than that no complaints, I would recommend.",4
