Unlike many other fashion harnesses on here, this one actually fits on an adult woman's body (not plus size though, and that should be clear from the listed measurements - this is not a plus size harness belt) and not just for very small teens with all their measurements in the 20s. I have a 34"" waist. The waist sizes listed are accurate, and despite having a very large chest, I am wearing the top shoulder belts on the tightest hook so this should work fine even for someone considerably taller than me at 5'3"" (probably even a whole foot taller) and should also fit male bodies in the size range. These types of belts are not a one size fits all thing so if you are smaller or larger than the range listed, you will not like how this belt fits and the proportions will be off. It will probably look the best on someone just a bit taller than me, and on the smaller end of that waist range.  Everything on the belt can be moved around easily for different body types and shapes. It looks pretty good, not too cheap and while probably not up to a lot of strain, the quality seems fine to wear for normal fashion use. It took me a second to figure out how to orient it to put it on but was otherwise not difficult at all, and there are lots of holes on all the belts to make it flexible. My method of putting it on was to loosely do the waist belts, then the shoulder belts, then adjust the waist better but YMMV. Very pleased for the price.",
Poverty All-Natural Shopper,Nice! Required Some Typical DIY.

I love the look of this one, and it fits my style well! It feels about as durable as most harnesses on the market in this price range, though this one is slightly pricier than most of the ones I already own.  This was a bit of a puzzle to put on at first, but I was able to figure it out by referencing the product image. Now that I’ve figured it out, I’ve got all the buckles in place and have it hanging on a hanger in such a way that it lies exactly how it will be worn, so I won’t be confused next time. I recommend the hanger method for all harnesses.  I’m petite and usually wear a teen size S or XS. After sizing all the straps and buckles and getting them into place, there was enough excess material hanging beyond where the buckles latched that I had to do some trimming with scissors, which was very easy and is typical of this style of harness. This harness could use some extra buckle holes, at the waist in my case, as even the tightest one was still a good deal too loose for me, and I’m certainly not the skinniest person in the world. So, if you’re on the thin side, expect to make some of your own holes to accommodate the waist buckles.  Overall, I really like this harness, and I recommend it to anyone who knows that harnesses typically require a small amount of very easy DIY.",2

If you're not super petite, I'd recommend checking the listing details first regarding the waist strap, particularly this section:  ""Attention: For full girls, the girth may not be enough for three turns, you can do two turns or add holes if needed. If it’s still bigger,you can clasp it in the back as well, because our length is enough.""  Although the image shows a range of up to 37 inches (36"" in the description), you may not be able to get the aesthetic you're hoping for as the length is likely not enough to wrap and then bring back around to buckle. I was able to get a decent fit for the center vertical back strap and front straps, allowing the waist to hit where it should. Technically, my waist works within the noted range, but I'd have to add a hole pretty far up that end of the strap to be able to buckle it in the back and then have a slight tail left. It's going to take some tinkering to get this to work well for me, unfortunately. (see try on photo with text and pretend I'm not just wearing lounge clothes, haha).  Quality wise, this is okay, but I wouldn't recommend this item if you're looking for a staple accessory. This is probably best if you want to try out the look before purchasing a higher quality piece. The harness came in a little frosted bag with no instructions and two separate pieces. Not super giftable, and I had to watch the listing's video multiple times before I was able to understand how to put together and don it. The hardware is really lightweight/the best quality, and I wish the black loop that secures the strap after you buckle it wasn't a different material (rubbery with some shine). Make sure to pull the straps so its buckle pin lays flat, otherwise they tend to slip out of place.  Technically, yes, this does fit, but I'd skip it if you have an average size chest and curvy hips, at least for the x wrap style. It's a bit frustrating to figure out and doesn't feel super durable. If I can finagle it, I do like the look, but I'm bummed that the back part will be a bit messy since I'll likely just have to tie it after the first front wrap.  Stars docked for the lack of instructions (especially as it arrived in two separate sections), flimsy materials, size listing discrepancies, and not being super accommodating for the average wearer.",3

The Video on the description page is extremely helpful to set this harness belt up. So make sure you watch that. The assemble is easy once you watched the video. It’s very cool wearing the belt on. The faux leather belt is soft enough to make me feel comfortable wearing it. Cons:Upon opening the package, it did have smells. I recommend waiting for a week or more time before wearing it.",

The quality of the leather is top notch and it looks great. The straps are adjustable so you can get the perfect fit and it’s really comfortable to wear. I love how it looks with my dresses and I’ve also been wearing it to parties and other events. It’s a great accessory that adds a bit of edge to my outfits. I definitely recommend this product,

But for the first time, it was a pain in the hoogamadooey to put on. Looks nice though if you are into this type of thing!",

First off, it’s really small. I have a 36” band size and it’s too tight at the loosest setting. If it is leather, it’s extremely fragile and tears easily, and my god I’ve never smelt something so chemical and putrid in my life. I don’t know what it’s made of but the smell burns my nose. It might work for a one off costume pieces, but definitely don’t expect to wear it regularly",
