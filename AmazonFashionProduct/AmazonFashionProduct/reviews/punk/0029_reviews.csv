The material is thin and crisp, like wearing a piece of paper almost. They fit ok at the waist, but the baggy crotch/butt area leaves you flapping in the wind. The material is uncomfortable and scratchy. Definitely don't sweat in these, or you'll be sore and raw. I absolutely CANNOT recommend these pants in any way! They fail in looks even for stage, they just don't fit well enough even to perform in, and as for comfort, they can't even pull that off.",

The one thing I do not like is the button pin because it feels flimsy and the inner stitching is poorly done it almost looks damaged. I have ordered 2 of these pants and both have the same quality.,

I ordered a size 32 and 34, because I’m working on loosing weight, Thinking I can wear one now and one pair for later when I reach my goal. So, they shrink 1 size. The 32 becomes a 31, and the 34 becomes a 33. Have to say that it fits nice and comfortable. So just remember to order 1 size up!",

As with most clothing in this style, most of the pockets are fake.  The two real pockets on either side of the front are barely large enough to fit a small phone, and the butt pockets are too slender to be of much use.  The zippers, although cool looking, do not lead anywhere.That aside, this is a very comfortable pair of pants.  The material is stretchy, but it will shrink in the first wash so order a size up.  It also collects lint like no one's business.  The zippers and the buckles are kind of cheap-feeling, but as they serve only as decoration, it doesn't detract from the value.  Overall it's about what you would expect for the price.",4

Do note that these are almost entirely cotton. I normally wear a 31 waist U.S. but went with the 32. I tried them on pre-wash, and they were a bit bigger around the waist than anticipated. Post warm wash, they shrunk just a bit, but not detrimentally. I'll still need a belt, but that's not unusual for me. (31 is an uncommon size.) Even with the slight shrink, these are still a comfortable slim fit for my somewhat muscular legs. I didn't do it for the first wash, but do follow the instructions to ""[m]achine wash inside out."" It'll save some wear and tear on the clothes and on your washer/dryer from the buckles and zippers banging around. As for the seller, note they are in South Korea. I didn't catch that until checkout and saw the estimated ship time. I went with DHL Express because I needed them now, and the pants arrive super fast. But if you're in the U.S. and you want to save money on shipping, be sure to order these early and don't be in a hurry.",2
