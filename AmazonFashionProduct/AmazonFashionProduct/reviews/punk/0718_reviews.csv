Happy Shopper,Perfect Zhitunemi Women's Steampunk Skirt Ruffle High Low Outfits,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRQDH5905QGBK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07RVMFWZR,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 27, 2024",Size: Medium-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Design and Style The high-low hemline is the standout feature, offering a dramatic flair that instantly elevates any outfit. The ruffled layers and lace detailing are beautifully done, giving the skirt a vintage, steampunk-inspired aesthetic. It pairs wonderfully with corsets or fitted tops, making it versatile for costume events or themed parties. The skirt is flattering for various body types, especially for plus-size women, as it accentuates curves without feeling restrictive.  Fit and Comfort This skirt is designed with comfort in mind. The elastic waistband provides a secure and adjustable fit, making it easy to wear for extended periods. It’s lightweight yet sturdy enough to hold its shape, so you can move freely without worrying about it sagging or shifting awkwardly.  Material Quality The fabric is a blend of polyester and lace, offering a decent balance between durability and aesthetics. While it looks elegant, the material feels a bit synthetic and might not be as breathable as natural fabrics. However, this is typical for costume-style clothing and doesn’t detract significantly from its overall appeal.  Performance Whether for cosplay, Halloween, or themed events, this skirt is a showstopper. It’s versatile enough to use in various looks—pair it with a corset for a steampunk vibe or a flowy blouse for a pirate-inspired ensemble. It holds up well during wear but might require some ironing or steaming to maintain its ruffled appearance after unpacking.  Value for Money For its price, the Zhitunemi Steampunk Skirt offers excellent value. It’s a budget-friendly option for creating intricate, themed outfits without sacrificing style. However, it’s more suited for occasional wear rather than everyday use due to the synthetic fabric.  Pros Stylish and versatile design Flattering for all body types Comfortable elastic waistband Affordable price point  Cons Fabric feels synthetic Requires occasional steaming/ironing to maintain appearance  The Zhitunemi Women's Steampunk Skirt is a fantastic addition to any costume wardrobe. It’s stylish, flattering, and affordable, making it a great choice for anyone looking to stand out at themed events. While the material isn’t premium, it delivers more than enough value for its price. Highly recommended for cosplay and costume enthusiasts!",

The color is off from what is presented for their “beige” which looks more brownish. It’s off white and I’m lucky I own a slip and fluffy things to wear underneath because yeah it’s transparent. It comes very wrinkled. Washing it with a low tumble will not help—you’ll need to iron on low which was safe but a giant pain. This is all for a Lies of P cosplay I wanted to do for Halloween and I’d really preferred if the color had been closer to what was shown but I took a risk not going with basic black. I can tell which other reviewers ironed and which didn’t.,
