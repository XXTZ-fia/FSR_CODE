Darla Manning,"Excellent style and quality, yet sizing was tricky.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I68P2PH85WYR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B087CK16KC,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 4, 2024",Size: Medium-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love the quality and style/look of the skirt. I also really appreciate that it has pockets. The range of the belt is nice too, in that if you get the right size you can wear it higher up on your waist or lower on your hips for different looks. The issue for me, however, was that I might be more in between sizes. The medium - large was too large for me even at it's tightest. Though I could make due if necessary, I could only wear it on my hips and even then I'd be constantly pulling it up so I'm returning it and ordering the small version, hoping that I will be able to take advantage of the entire  range from waist to hips. If I only cared about wearing it on my hips and was taller than 5'4"" and wore at least 2"" or 3"" soles along with the skirt every time, it might be less of an issue. For reference, my waist is about 28"" and I weigh about 130lbs. Knowing where you want it to sit on your torso should help you decide on what size will best suit you.",2
Phelan Family,Great on Stage!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26ZMDQLDI3SJ1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B087CK16KC,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 26, 2024",Size: X-Small-SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,Bought XS for my daughter's performance in a musical.

Kacey McDaniel,Definitely go by the size guide.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R350X8F9N0S6KL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B087CK16KC,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2024",Size: Medium-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I ordered a Medium where I used to only order small. Reading the size guide I determined that a Medium is the better fit.  This is made to hang above the hip bones, and as such is pretty long, so if you're under 5'4"" this will be at your ankles and possibly drag on the floor if you are super short.  Really good product comparable to the clothing you might find at a Hot Topic store.",3

The way it flows as you walk is runway-quality. You don't have to worry about choosing the exact right size because the belt can accommodate many waist sizes while still looking great. The fabric is good and sturdy, no cheap materials here. A stunning piece that is well built and will last.",

Bought the XL-XXL sized one but still fell short buy too much to wear it myself, wasn't expecting them to be made for people with no waist/hips. Beyond that the material feels nice and it doesn't look cheep. Gonna give them to a couple of my much smaller friends as gifts.",

gogo,A bit large for a small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BGNVV6S2IUKE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B087CK16KC,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 11, 2023",Size: X-Small-SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,Got the half skirt in and I ordered a small and it seems very big for a small. It wraps all the way around waist and then some instead of just a half skit it fits likes a whole skirt. I’m keeping because it’s made well and cute but I will have to take to seamstress to make smaller.,

K.

My friends say I look like some goth video game character with it on.  It goes with a lot of my black clothes.  I've gotten compliments from strangers too.  Also as a female, I enjoy very much how it covers my butt.  Can wear stretchy or slim goth pants with this and not have to worry about gross guys checking out my butt while I'm on a date with my husband.  It's a bit swooshy too while I walk, which makes me feel pretty cool.  Would buy again.Also should note for fitting purposes for other buyers, I am 5 foot 6.5 inches and the buckle clasp fits around the narrow area of the waist (where you take your waist measurement) just above the naval.  My waist is 29 inches which fits at the tightest buckle on the garment.  Fitted thusly, it will be long but not drag or touch the floor.  Please note if you wear it lower on your waist or are shorter than me, it may drag on the floor or need altering (or you might want to wear heels).  If your waist is smaller than 29 inches it may sit lower on your body near your hip area.  If your waist is bigger have no fear, it is adjustable and has half a dozen belt notches for various girths.",16

Evelyn,Buy your usual size!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RC8TYDRFQGYV7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B087CK16KC,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 29, 2021",Size: X-Small-SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I originally ordered this in a medium because the description said to size up due to foreign production. I fit it low on my hips on the tightest ring. So I exchanged for a small, my usual size. Way better! I can wear it around my waist (26”) on the tightest loop, and if I wanted to wear it lower on my hips (33”) I could, BUT then I would have to wear heels. I’m 5’5” and this skirt is about an inch off the ground at its longest point when I’m barefoot and wearing it at my waist. Wearing it around my hips I’d definitely need heels or it’ll drag on the floor. Nice solid material. Very happy with this purchase.",5

I like it so much I'd love if it came in a larger size so that I could buy it and wear as a FULL skirt (completely closed)We bought a large ( the largest size it comes in). It's meant to be open and it fit her well leaving about a 5 or 6"" opening at the waist. The waist has a built in belt and she had it on the 3rd smallest notch ( there is 7 notches about an inch apart) Her waist is 30"".  It has 2 large pockets which we love. The fabric is stiff to keep the shape, but it's still soft to the touch.  Very happy with it.Ps I tried it on for size and I was at the 4th  notch ( i'm 5""9"" and 168 pounds).",8
