Amanda,Just as pictured!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ9L4JLY8QE6B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTM7BTMV,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 22, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I got the black shirt, honestly I'm not sure what some of the reviews are talking about because this shirt is exactly how it looks it . The only small complaint I have is that the print on the back of the shirt can get a little bit hot because it's slightly plasticy. But it's so freaking cool! I get compliments on it all the time! Get it",
Amy,Not the same as the photo & not oversized,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YKSD8COT29NE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTM7BTMV,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 25, 2024",Color: WhiteSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"The second I opened the shirt I was surprised to see that it wasn't an off-white/cream color, but rather plain white. The shirt is the same size as my other medium-sized shirts when the page title says ""Loose Oversized"". In addition, the printed design isn't like the image where it blends in with the rest of the shirt and is smaller than suggested in the photos.",

The shirt i received is nothing like what was pictured. Complete rip off quality wise. The shirt isnt even cotton it looks more like polyester with a terrible smell. The tag on the shirt is not at all like the one pictured the shirt is basically see through and do not recommend anyone buy this. The print on the front is completely off and the design on the back feels like paper. The sizing on it is also off i got an XL and it fits like an M.,2
