It’s a little difficult to figure out how to put it on the body but it took me a minute to figure it out but eventually did after referencing it by the photos. The leather is durable and not too thick or thin and is comfortable to wear and looks exactly as pictured. I had a particular idea for this piece and not gothic. Yet used as a fashion piece for statement with a look I was going for and looks amazing and received so many compliments. Goes well with army cargo high waisted wide leg jeans and a button up long sleeve bodysuit and/or a button up shirt. Also keep in mind that this does bleed and may transfer color on lighter clothing. I am going to try and fix that issue and if I can remove some of the dye but I did have to condition the leather and soften and shine it up a bit. I highly recommend this piece if your into fashion or just want a grunge look. Decent leather but not the best but it is leather.,
