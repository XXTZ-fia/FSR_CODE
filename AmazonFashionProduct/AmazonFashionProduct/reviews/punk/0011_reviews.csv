It did… for one day. I didn’t eat well the second day, and I was super surprised how quickly your fingers can get skinny - not to mention the freezing A/C in Florida where I regretfully live. I had to move the ring to my middle finger, which I normally reserve for paying tribute to Florida’s governor. It wore OK on that one, but I really want the weather to turn so I can put it back on my ring finger. Oddly, no one has said one word about the ring, despite the fact that I’ve worn it to bars and restaurants several days in a row.
