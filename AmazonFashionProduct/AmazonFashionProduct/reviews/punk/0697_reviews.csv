I’m 5’7, 160 lbs, B cup bra and wearing a size M. The only downside to this top I would say is that if your arms are muscular/bigger like mine, the sleeves will be restricting and you won’t be able to lift them or move them around very much at all. I was able to fix this by stretching my arms and thus stretching the material out some. Even then I still couldn’t reach them over my head but it was comfortable enough to still wear it. I would have given this product 5 stars otherwise, but yes, super cute and absolutely recommend, especially if your arms are in the skinnier side.",7

The wire the buttons are on itself is supper hard and won’t bend therefore making it extremely hard to button on. The sleeves feel like they might rip if I lift my hands up too high but other than those 2 issues, it’s a good top for the price",3
