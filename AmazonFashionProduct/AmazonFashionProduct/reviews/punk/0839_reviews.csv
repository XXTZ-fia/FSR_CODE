I put it on and could not get it off, it broke, and we had to cut it because there was a stable in the tie. It almost stabbed me. I got the smallest size, and it was still too big for me. The dress itself is kind of like a tablecloth. It's cute but the tie is the exact same color as the dress and it doesn't even work correctly it's too unsafe.",2
