It does have a fishy smell due to the pu leather processing, but once you air it out in the sun for couple days, the smell goes away. I plan on decking out this jacket with big tree spike studs and gluing on patches with E6000 (which is safe on pu leather fabrics) and fill it with real stainless steel spikes and make it even more bad a55!!!
