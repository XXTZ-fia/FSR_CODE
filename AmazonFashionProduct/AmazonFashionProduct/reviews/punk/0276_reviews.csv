It was too sheer and see thru. If your bra is darker it will show thru. I would need a tank top under. It fit well except the sleeves are a little ling at the wrist. There is a lined V neck under the bow so you can take it on and off and not mess up your hair or makeup. I am 5'5"" and 165lbs and it fit comfy. It's more light yellow than beige. I wish they had lined it or doubled up the fabric. I was wearing a grey bralette under, and you could see the outline. It might not be so sheer with the darker colors. My plumb color didn't ship so I cancelled that one. It felt comfortable, to sit as the waist is stretchy at the back. I don't have patience for see thru shirts, worried if my bra line is poking thru. So I am returning. I got a lightening deal. If I wear under a jacket blazer, the cuffs will show as they cover my wrists to where my thumbs start. Overall, I would recommend Grace Karin clothes, but the reason the Beige costs less than other colors, is it gets returned. My package was a customer return, in a generic poly bag, not a branded bag. I would try a darker color in the future. If I loose weight I will size down to a Large. I am overweight at the moment. The cut was good and fit my upper arms. But, you will need a padded tank bralette on the lighter colors like white. If you have dark aeri olas you will want a padded cup. The beige is really a pale light yellow not ivory.",

Nevertheless, I decided to give it a go and ordered the small. I am 5'1"" 96lbs. The shirt arrived was nice but it didn't have the flattened tummy part as in the introduction picture, it looked like a pleated cummerbund around the middle. Upon further inspection there was V notch that was never shown in the pictures that if the bow isn't exactly centered it will show and look odd. I love GK line of blouses, however this is my first time purchasing, and unfortunately most probably my last since she carries no smaller sizes. 😢",8
