Jennifer,Lightweight but great price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1J3R3NET3EZVD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHKSS5XR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2025",,,"I got this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter bc she has a huge chain collection & this one looked different than her others, not to mention she absolutely loves spikes. I wasn’t sure what to expect at $5, but once I opened it I understood how they could price it so low. It does look as pictured but it is incredibly light weight. From what I can tell, the  spikes are hollow & im not totally sure if this chain is even metal. Don’t get me wrong it looks like metal & looks amazing as a decoration on clothing, but not nearly as heavy duty as some of her other chains. Totally worth the $5 though just nothing more",
