Anonymous,Love it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U17GJPT75LAI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B091XY2SQR,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 27, 2024",Style: Thorns,Verified Purchase,"Love the barbed wire look, it’s cool cause you can adjust it to a choker or a longer necklace due to the design. The only thing is the hook blends into the necklace very easily which is both a good thing and a bad thing. It takes me a little extra time to find the clasp sometimes depending on how I wear it.",

Looks nice though,

Only thing is the rings that hold everything together weren't fully closed so I had to use some pliers to close the clasps because part of the necklace did end up falling off before I could even wear it but it was an easy fix. I still recommend, it's a really cute necklace!!!",3
