Jessica Jean,"Runs big, slouches down",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2K33P6ZLKVWI0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKHX3MRG,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 10, 2024",Color: GraySize: One Size,Verified Purchase,"I have been wearing these type of long arm covers since I was a teenager (I’m 45). I have knitted my own, bought them, and received hand knitted ones as gifts.  These are the first arm warmers that are too big for me. They slouch down, not staying up on my arm. I still like them; I need to have different expectations of these arm warmers and think of them as funky gloves (even though they are not very warm)  They would be excellent for plus size women who have larger arms. I would not recommend for thin or young women.",
