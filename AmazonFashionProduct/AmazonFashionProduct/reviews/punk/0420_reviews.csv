This wasn’t made in China (thank goodness) so I’d choose your regular size if you are on the fence. The color is okay for olive drab, but the fabric isn’t the greatest. It’s thin, really itchy and kind of “spotty” meaning that it looks faded in some areas and not in others, not happy about that. I’m hoping that after it’s washed and drowned in fabric softener, it’ll feel better on my skin. I’m overly finicky about the feel of any fabric so it may not affect anyone else. All in all, for the price and how different and cute it is, I’m happy with it. I love wearing something that you don’t see everywhere and on everyone. May get another in black.",3
