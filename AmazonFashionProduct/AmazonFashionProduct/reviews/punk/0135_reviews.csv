Amazon Customer,Broke during shipping,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XA7P0LP2Y9FN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09C6CHV47,"2.0 "," the United States "," August 8, 2022",,Verified Purchase,Broke upon arrival - didn’t make it through the mail. Might want to think about adding more protection for the item for shipping. The metal quality is very brittle - pieces would benefit from some extra padding and packing with care like a little card board jewelry box with cotton to keep them safe. I was aware I was buying something affordable but I would have hoped they would arrive to me in one piece. They would have been cute!!,
