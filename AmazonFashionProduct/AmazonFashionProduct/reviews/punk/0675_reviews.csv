Therese,Love it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ7W600N7GV59/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BD7F7CV7,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 4, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Green 2,Verified Purchase,This was an amazing order! Literally the best. It is so comfy and fits perfectly! I ordered a small. It’s just a little long but I’ll grow into it. For reference I’m 80-84 pounds and 4’10. And it fits perfectly. The appearance is really cute and good just a little see-through but I wear an undershirt under it. It’s a little stretchy but not that stretchy so it’s a win win. The fabric is kind of a silk material.,3

Online shopper,Cute but misleading.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OLMAIAU6GHD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BD7F7CV7,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 22, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Striped Coffee,Verified Purchase,"When I opened the package, the first thing i noticed immediately was that it did not look like the first picture that was displayed. The shirt is cute, don’t get me wrong, but make sure you know which shirt you’re buying before you get it, or else you’ll be expecting one thing and getting another. It also fits very tight around the arms, which I’m gonna have to work around, and the neck area is VERY large. I would return it, but it took so long to get here I’ll learn to deal with it. Keep these things in mind.",
