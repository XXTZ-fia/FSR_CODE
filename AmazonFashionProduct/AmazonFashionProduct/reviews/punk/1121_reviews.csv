However, the underside looks, feels and smells like PU. So what I'm guessing is, they wrapped a thin layer of real leather around a PU belt. But that is speculation. It's definitely the nicest belt I've ever received for free. If I'd paid for it I would give it 4 stars because it's still a gorgeous belt that doesn't look cheap at all.  And it came with a free hole punch! Not that I'll need one -- there are plenty of discrete holes and if I had to punch any more, I'd probably need to go to the hospital before resizing the belt. That said, I got the 32-35"" and my (low) waist is 32, almost always. The very last hole fits comfortably so if you're 33+ I may go to the next size up. Unless you plan to wear it right under your rib cage. It's a vibe?  Because I'm fixated on color, here: I got the coffee color, and it's truly a deep espresso brown, but not so dark that it could be mistaken for black. The leather and the gold are ever-so-slightly warmer than the photos. Classic aged brass rather than gold (which I prefer). Again, nothing at all looks cheap. Really glows in dim light in an expensive way.  I would buy this belt -- but again, I would give it 4 stars if I did. If it falls apart quickly I'll update but I really don't see that happening.",

I checked the product description, which said it is faux leather. It could have fooled me. The gold hardware complements the tawny brown leather nicely.  I sometimes struggle with belt fit because I may want to wear the same belt with high-, low- or medium-waisted pants, requiring a considerable size range. This belt offers a flexible fit, with a generous 10 holes punched about one inches apart. The belt can be buckled to create lengths from 32 to 41 inches, far more than the 36-40"" listed. That works well for me. A metal piece was also included in the package in case I want to punch more holes using a hammer. I don’t think I’ll need it for this belt because the pre-punched range seems sufficient, but it may be useful for adjusting the length of other belts.  The width of the strap is just over one inch, compared to 1.3 to 1.5 inches for most of the belts I normally wear with jeans. The narrower width gives the belt a dressier feel, although it can obviously be worn with a variety of pant styles.",
