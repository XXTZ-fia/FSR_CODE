I wear a size 12-14 and usually a large-medium in tops depending on fit.  I went by the sizing chart and found mine to be a little big.  If I was wearing it as a top on it's own then maybe I'd like it, since it would be a bit loose around the middle, but wearing it under a corset, I found that I needed it a tiny bit tighter then I might normally wear.  It was bulky around the decolletage area once everything was cinched.  But not too bad.  I'd highly recommend this.  The sleeves were gorgeous! and I loved how it all looked.",41

Ill be exchanging for a smaller size and color change (to fit my outfit, nothing wrong with the apricot at all).

Its made of very cheap gabric and sleeves are VERY VERY puffy. Way puffyer than picture. This also kept ripping on me even though it was too large in most areas. The seams are very badly sewn together and its practically see through. The corset sidding is the only way to make it fir better and is very long for short people. Definitely change out the threadig it comes with and be careful of seams ripping. I would only wear this as a costume peice and nothing else. The only reason i havent returned it yet is because it is for a costume party coming up. Will probably turn it into a pillow after it rips more.,7

The cuffed sleeves were nice as it added color and were able to be as tight or loose as you wanted. The only thing I did not like is that it had a tendency to ride up a little the more I moved resulting in me having to readjust from time to time. If not, the top went a little too high up on the chest as well as the bottom feeling like it wasn’t down low enough. Overall, I’m pleased with it.",

To wear a corset belt with it, and have shirt material sticking out below, a larger shirt would have been better for me.  THAT SAID… if you have a larger chest, don’t mind the length, and your arms are more toned, you could still wear a Large. (Assuming you’re short & thicker like me). It’s stretchy material. Also, because the leather on the arms is tighter, it helps keep the top of the shirt down over the shoulders, like most would want to wear it anyway.  *I washed with dark colors on Delicate, and let it air dry.
