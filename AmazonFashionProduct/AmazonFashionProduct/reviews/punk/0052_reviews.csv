They are just like safety pins with the exception that they're built of nice quality metal and the ends aren't sharp. They take a second to get used to because they're designed for the appearance rather than the functionality of a normal earring. There isn't a slot or divet for the post to rest in your ear. It just sticks in like you had stuck an actual safety pin in your ear.,

I put them in relatively new upper ear piercings and they were so heavy they tore the holes into short lines. Maybe it would've gone better if they'd been fully healed, but they were heavy enough I expect not. Every night I didn't sleep flat on my back, I woke up and they were very bloody and irritated. Eventually the pain and damage was bad enough, I had to fully take them out and let the piercings close.",2

After observing this item,  I began to think about just using safety pins that I already have at home.
