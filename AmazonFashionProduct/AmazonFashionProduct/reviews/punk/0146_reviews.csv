Melissa,Great corset for multiple costumes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JYS2JP1SPRIP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM96SZL8,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 17, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: #1-black Leather,Verified Purchase,"I love this corset. I use it for a few costumes and i wish they had the same style with zipper in more colors. Keep the ease of putting it on but just slightly change the details of the look. Like cross buckles different size buckles, maybe a cool detailed piece that just velcros across the chest or something There's a lot you could do but keep the same function",
Austin,Size up,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FN5OEBB45C7Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM96SZL8,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 20, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: #7-brown,Verified Purchase,"I weigh 160-165 lbs, 5'5"", and my chest area measures around 43"". I got the XL, it didn't fit immediately. I undid the string behind the corset, and re-stringed it to better fit my size. If you have a bust size like mine, or bigger, I would size up if you do not want to use my method of making the corset fit. Corset is good tho. I do recommend.  This was meant to be delivered on Sept 28th, but ended up getting delivered 10 days early. That was awesome.",2

Very small!! I normally wear a medium and got the XL. I should have gotten it in an even larger size. Luckily the back expands significantly.,
Rose Reagan,Love the design,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2H7ZFP15P6IU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM96SZL8,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 5, 2023",Size: SmallColor: #1-black Leather,Verified Purchase,"Great product. It is hard for myself (very small / almost child sized) to find a product that fits me with my dimensions. It fits really well. Though as I don't have much meat to me the straps on my shoulders are too tall sadly. Even pushing my shoulders back all the way isn't quite enough. Still, even with that I still love it as soon I'll have it fixed since its such a small detail. ^_^",
Traci,Cool but. . .,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CGDZ9FVFEMW2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM96SZL8,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 25, 2023",Size: LargeColor: #2-purple,Verified Purchase,"Made for stick figure, thats not me.  I am 5'3 140 lbs. It would look FABULOUS on someone taller/thinner.  It runs a bit long for the petite sized human.",3
Lacey,high quality for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ESBF7EVCSX4O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM96SZL8,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 27, 2023",Size: 6X-LargeColor: #2-purple,Verified Purchase,"I got the 6XL according to the measurements on the size chart that it would fit me. I am very plus sized. 280 lbs, 5ft 8in, torrid size 3-4, size 24/26 with most of my weight in the middle. My tummy fat roll fit in this corset!! I pulled the laces out all the way (sorry no picture of this yet) and hooked the front. my husband easily pulled the laces up and not even as tight as it could go! It was surprisingly comfortable, I could sit down and move around easily. I am so glad I took a chance on this. I am using it for a ren faire cosplay. I intend to accessorize and have a better bra, I was just excited when it came in because it is very pretty, well made, and the hooks are metal boned. I would order this again in a heartbeat and even in  more colors just to wear for date night! It did shop from China but didn't take that long, arrived sooner than they said it would. It is not really returnable. I paid for shipping because even with shipping cost and price it was cheaper than the same corset from other sellers selling it cheaper but with 3 times the shipping cost!",5
