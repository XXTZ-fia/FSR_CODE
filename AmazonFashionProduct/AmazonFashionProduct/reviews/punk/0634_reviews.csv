I wasn't expecting quality out of these at that price. What I was expecting were adjustable belts and buckles. They are sewn shut, and do not move, but the loops aren't sewn down, so they will just dangle weirdly on your thighs. So for these to fit right and not fall off, you have to have a small waist, tree trunk thighs, skinny calves, and you have to wear them almost at your belly button because the crotch is waaaay too tall.",

The only big issue is that you really can't put such low quality zippers on pants like these. Mine broke (in a way that cannot be repaired) the second time I tried them on. So it makes the whole piece unwearable now.,

As always, I'll try to provide details important to fit and overall quality.  First, for a pair of faux leather pants that run about $30, the quality is what you'd expect. It's decent but not absolute perfection. Your standards shouldn't be that high at this price point. If it is... put down the crack pipe. The seams appear to be sewn well, with a few stray threads here and there. The zipper does feel a little on the cheap side. The fish smell that some folks have mentioned in their reviews? Yeah, it's there. I've turned mine inside out & sprayed them with Febreeze, leaving them to air dry outside for a day or two.  Next, the fit. I'm 5'8"", 210, with a muscular build & fairly big upper legs. My regular size of jeans is 34-36, depending on designer & cut. These will fit like ""skinny jeans."" They do have stretch but they're going to be snug. I've ordered the 36's and they are fit to size in the waist and tight in the thigh area. I'd strongly suggest wearing a pair of compression shorts underneath to get them on and off easily. They're slightly long at my height but someone 5'10"" to 6', they'd be perfect. However, if you're shorter, the legs are snug enough that you can't really tell they are long.  They seem like they'd be great for stage gear or clubbing. Hope the review helps.",39
