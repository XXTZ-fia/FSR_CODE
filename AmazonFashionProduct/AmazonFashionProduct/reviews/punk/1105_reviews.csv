Christopher,overall just bad,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RODDE61V6OJC4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNCN1B9T,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 28, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black8,,I was in need of pants and I wanted a cheaper alternative for my style. when I ordered I sized up a little bit so it would be a little loose but comfortable but instead I got a very tight fit in my hips and waist. the over all design of the pants where also bad it doesn't compare to the image. the pants looked very 2D and not fleshed out properly. and I bet you think the straps look cool well those are holding on with hopes and prayers. they use buttons to hold it on but they fell off while putting them on and serval times after( I was standing still). I do not recommend thesis pants unless you hate yourself and enjoy wasting money.,
