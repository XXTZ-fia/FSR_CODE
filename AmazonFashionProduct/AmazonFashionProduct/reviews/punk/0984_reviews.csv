Great quality not too heavy but enough to make you warm at the end of the day. I wash and wear throw it in the dryer to release the wrinkles. Enjoy.,

It’s more of a polyester nylon material with a bit of a sheen. I definitely wouldn’t recommend putting this in the dryer and I’m a little concerned about how long the decals will last. My biggest issue is that this is not by any means oversized. I’m a medium typically with a small frame. 5ft 2in and 150 lbs. I bought a xxl because I wanted a really roomy fit but it’s more like a large. It’s baggy but it’s not fitting like the photo. I still really like the shirt and it’s really warm. Unless you’re a xs this isn’t going to fit you like it fits the model and you’ll need to size up at least 3x your normal size for and over size fit.,
