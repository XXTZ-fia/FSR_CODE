Sam,Hard to Put On,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R335QFQBZUUWQZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D66P1TCD,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 26, 2024",Color: Black,,"These are such cute earrings. They're smaller than I expected which I love because it makes them look as dainty as they are edgy. They're also a nice, solid metal that hasn't irritated my metal allergy which I'm grateful for. Honestly, the biggest problem is how curved the post is. It makes them difficult to get on and off because of the intense curve. The hinge also opens quite easily which means I feel the need to check that they're still there every few minutes. Admittedly, the curve has kept them in even when the hinge opened.",2
