Amazon Customer,"Perfect fit, amazing color + FRONT POCKETS!!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T8AJ7MAM26PY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4YQYGXV,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 7, 2024",Color: PurpleSize: X-Small,Verified Purchase,"105 lbs, 5'3, ordered an XS and they are def true to size!  Omg, never had a pair of jeans with front pockets in my entire life. The front pockets can fit my entire phone easily. The back pockets are very comfortable even with the zippers on the sides.  The material isn't a traditional jean type material, it's very stretchy and really comfortable. They aren't very thick which is a pro for hot summer days, but they aren't thin enough for to appear transparent or low quality. Plus the button and zippers all feel high quality!  Only problem I had was that the legs were pretty long on me (easily fixable with a sewing machine). I'm 5'3 and the original length of these pants would easily be perfect for someone with above 5'6. One strange oddity that I can note is that the colored/plaid half of the pants have a very slightly larger leg opening, but not significant enough to effect the fit.  Overall 5 stars! Perfect for a goth, emo or punk look and the lack of holes make them work/office friendly! They shipped fast and arrived on time, true to size and I would love to order more in different colors.",
