I was a lil skeptical just from the pics. But once my Lrg arrived it fit and looks perfect. I'm 5'11 /145 lbs and I grabbed a Lrg to wear a sweater underneath. It fits so comfortable I luv it. So hard to find good base jackets to build your thrash and/or punk vests. These are great for the price. *I feel the rips are a bit of a..poser look. So I burned mine. Looks 10x better, after burning them to grey back burnt look + Buttons feel a lil weakly sewed. May require replacement over time and heavy use. Time will tell..",
