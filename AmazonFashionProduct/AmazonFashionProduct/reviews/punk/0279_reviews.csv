For reference, it’s 39” in the waist!  39!  The sizing shows that a size 8 fits someone with a 40” bust.  The bust measurement of the garment I received is 44”.  While the style is attractive enough, the fabric is much too lightweight for a jacket.  Also, the color is not as pictured.  The green shows up on the webpage as being more of a dark teal green and also is described as such in several reviews.  The one I received is more hunter green.

I have to fold the collar down so it will sit better on my chest and shoulders.  I added a wide belt on the outside of the Jacket top to make up for the weird fit. It looks great with the belt.

While yes, it's designed for steam punk, it's classy enough to wear to work, wear to business conferences, and to make a general fashion statement where appropriate.  The only thing I didn't like about the jacket is it comes overly rinkled so have an iron ready.  The button is also barely sewed on, and mine came right off when putting it on the first time.  I had to resew the button on but, it was an easy fix for me.  Would still most definitely recommend this because the button is a super easy fix and the jacket looks great with slacks, jeans, skirts, or to have a steampunk or fantasy gothic moment.  Well worth the buy.  While this was meant to be apart of a halloween costume, I find myself wearing it frequently.",

I took up about 1 inch from each side of the waist and also adjusted the back to make the waist fit better.  I think it would look better with corseting and a tie at the back.
