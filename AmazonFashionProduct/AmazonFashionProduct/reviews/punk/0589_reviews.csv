Amber,Bust fits odd for me,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1G5REOM7C6919/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD3M31MY,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I am usually a size L and the top is so loose/long it looks really odd around my chest area.. could be flattering if it was better fitting for me. Every other part of this dress I like. So I might see if I can return to get a different size? (Definitely look for biker short shape wear for this underneath, it is revealing.)",
Love To Shop,VERY SEXY!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2K1A4X22RNP4K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD3M31MY,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 13, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"Careful - I'm 5'7"" tall and it still dragged the ground. The slits up the thighs are REALLY high, therefore, if you do not want your goods to show - recommend wearing shorts or something to cover. Otherwise, absolutely great for my Barbarian outfit at Texas Renaissance Festival.",
SittingPrettyNails,Decent dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CPYGSJ0AMZXD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD3M31MY,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 29, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Small,,"If you like dresses that have slits in them, this is a cute option. You do have slits on both sides of this dress so make sure you have on under garments just in case. It is not my favorite dress only because it falls to a weird length and does not go all the way down to your feet.",
Shar Taylor,Fit and quality.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R262DYU2G0ZAZ5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD3M31MY,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 20, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,,"Edgy dress. The fit is okay, but a bit snug. I usually wear a size large in clothing. I feel a size extra large would be more comfortable for me. The size chart is reliable. The fabric has some stretch. The side slits are extremely high and revealing. The drawstring at the slit is adjustable. The quality and craftsmanship is good. There’s no loose thread or broken seams. It’s a versatile dress. Perfect for night out at the clubs, concerts, or even cosplaying. Overall I like it and I feel it’s worth the value.",3
