I couldn’t find a way to “make it work” like another reviewer mentioned doing. It just looked like I had a belt that was broken. My photo is strictly to show true color.  Harness would be super cute if it fit!",
Kevlar B Lightning,Super Cute Ren Faire Accessory,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O6T7XYXPGXRJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BP7LSYCD,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 10, 2024",Color: Brown,Verified Purchase,"While I will definitely get use of this for some street wear and club looks, I did get it in light brown specifically for the ren faire! My over-dress had some strings in the middle to snatch it in a bit, but I wasn't going to be wearing a corset or anything (too dang hot!) and adding this harness gave me the ability to add a bit of a ""belt"" with a bit more flair! I purchased separately a pair of skirt hikes that are a near match in color that I slipped on the long criss-cross pieces before buckling up, and it was perfect for carrying and appearance! For me, this made it so I could carry fewer things total, and less in a bag and not need a backpack! And again, super cute!  The one-size did work out for me, I have a short torso, larger bust, and can adjust the waist for the smallest part, to accommodate any bloating or issues with my tummy very easily!",
nickole hall,Not for plus size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VKQ3RMZUXB2J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BP7LSYCD,"1.0 "," the United States "," August 29, 2024",Color: Brown,Verified Purchase,Imma size 20 only wrapped around 1&1/2 times instead the 2 x’s the picture shows,

It’s pretty tight on me in the belly area. I am 180 lbs, 5’4 .. stomach size is decent. I haven’t Wore it out yet just tried it on w outfits. Dresses seem to fit better w it. If you want this to spice up your dress, get it.",

Linnea Clark-Hapy,THIS is the one,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TWYN6I1ZBCTC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BP7LSYCD,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2024",Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"Super cute belt and although it was kind of complicated to figure out, it is SUPER flattering and cute on. Didn’t come with directions but it’s got the suspender at the back so I used that as a guide to figure it out.  I’m 5’11”, 175 lbs, a size 6-8, and it fit very well with tons of left over belt length at the waist. This can fit a large range of body sizes. I would choose this one over the others this brand sells.  I got it in black and I hope to buy more colors in the future!",12
April French,Decent waist belt for the price.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UPJF9Q28Y6JF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BP7LSYCD,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 1, 2023",Color: White,Verified Purchase,Couldn’t loop it twice around my 34” waist so not very plus friendly.

Its wrap around design is super cute on and easy to figure out due to the only ends have clips on them. Very flattering and worth the price!,
Reviews By J,Flimsy & Incorrect Sizing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZB2CZFYO8657/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BP7LSYCD,"1.0 "," the United States "," November 1, 2023",Color: Gold,Verified Purchase,"I don't know if this product had been worn already or what, but the belt holes were worn and torn. It was so thin and flimsy material, that it could have even been ripped in shipping. Even if you were really gentle with this, it would rip. I also measured the straps and they are shorter than advertised.",
