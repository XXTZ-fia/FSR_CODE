The velvet was very warm so not suggested for summer or waem climates because it was very thick as well. The lace was very soft, but the seams inside the jacket were a bit scratchy. I would suggest lining it or wearing it over another top. The neck closure was actually totally fine for me even at my size and was fairly comfortable overall.",11
