These earrings complimented my outfit so well. I got so many compliments on them. Though they are larger earrings they are lightweight and comfortable to wear. They did not tug on my earlobes. Though it is not real gold, they are decent quality. I only wore them for one night so I did not have an issue with tarnishing or turning my earlobes. If you need a quick accessory to complete a 90s themed outfit these are great value for your money.",
