Skip the dryer and hang to dry outside if you can,5

The material has that cheap polyester like feel and the chains are also very flimsy. The suspenders are also fixed in place and cannot be removed. Also there are only 3 belt loops??? Why cheap out on belt loops of all things?! Those are my only complaints.  They're TRIPP styled pants at a third of the price. You can't go wrong. And to be fair, TRIPP pants aren't known for their longevity.  Trying these on definitely took me back to 2004 when I got my first pair of bondage pants. Worth every penny.  Warning to baby goths: don't wear these too much. They are NOT made to last! Get a mesh bag to wash the pants in so they don't rip themselves apart in the washing machine.",
