Sadly, the XL was too big for my 5'9'', 180 lbs. pear-shaped frame. I wanted it to be more fitted over my button-down blouses to accentuate my slender waist. I decided to reorder it in the next size down. I'm pretty long waisted, so I was hoping it would be long enough in the L size. I think in the 3 colors I like, the vests will be fun layering pieces to add to my wardrobe, that is if the L fits correctly. I have lots of tops and blouses they I think will work great with. I'm going to change the buttons to black, but I'm pretty sure I have some on hand. UPDATE: after trying on the large (a size down from what I first ordered) it fit nicely, except the design was too short and the neckline too deep for my preference. I decided to return both sizes in all 3 colors. Besides the fit, none of the colors looked good with my skintone. Lastly, as 100% polyester, it wasn't very insulative. It's cold in cold weather and hot in warmer weather. I really wanted a classic style vest as a warm laying piece for the cold months, almost half the year here in SE Idaho. That's not what this vest design gave me, which was disappointing because I like the classic style.",
