Amanda M.,Cute but only comfy in shorter spans,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYGE8PS4VJKAH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08L7Q44B6,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 27, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"The clasps are so frustrating, and somewhay uncomfortable at the back of the neck, but the elasticity is good, it is definitely just bra straps so it has the limitations you'd expect from that. But damn, it looks cute, especially layered over something else with split strap sleeves. I was worried it wouldn't fit me at all since I wear plus sizes, but it manages okay since I could adjust it.",3
Breonna Joyce Jackson,Great!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPXSVXUFXEZBC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08L7Q44B6,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 25, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"This harness is soooo wonderful! It’s very adjustable and stretchy to fit different body types. It looks nice, is pretty simple to figure out, and a great price comparatively.  BUT the top neck strap can’t be loosened very much, and the bottom neck strap flips up often and can be annoying.  Overall I’d recommend it! Oh, and my bf recommends it too!",3

Kat D,The bottoms are an absolute puzzle,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5YSKXUJQ87PU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08L7Q44B6,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 18, 2023",Size: One SizeColor: Black-set,Verified Purchase,I LOVE this set once I get it on. The top I wear with more regularity. It takes serious commitment and puzzle skills to figure out how to put the bottoms on but I love them when I have the energy to get it right. We've even tried marking them with ribbons for reminders of what goes where and it's STILL so challenging to sort out.,
beelzebbub,nice.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VG5Q736OIH5C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08L7Q44B6,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2023",Size: One SizeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"it's a little too small for me but i don't consider that a fault of the product, just a fact of life. it's nicely stretchy and adjustable, pretty easy to figure out how to put it on.  my only complaint really is that the two parts that latch around the neck don't like to behave and kinda bunch together? i don't know if this is a problem with my body specifically or the product. i'm inclined to believe the former.",

I ordered a black one previously and love it so I ordered one in green. It is very much not what I ordered and NOTHING like the black one. It’s also waaaaaayyyy lower quality.,5

I'd say the topmost part of the choker portion of the harness is a little too high up for my own tastes but the whole thing is easily adjustable and sits really nicely on my body. I'm about 5'3 and 125 lbs for reference. I can't wait to wear this! Made me feel really nice about myself. I'm even tempted to look into other styles too!,
