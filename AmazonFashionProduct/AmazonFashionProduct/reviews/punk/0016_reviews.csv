Fit just as expected and I like the tight grip.  Already got my second pair, fits differently but fun, too, with the lace up leg.  Bonus, easy to clean many simple spills.  As for smell, starts that way likely due to preservative treatment used to keep garment safe until it’s gets to your door.  Simple fix: mix half distilled white vinegar with half water and spray outside/wipe. Best also to machine wash cold water delicate in a mesh garment bag and hang dry. Mix in a bit of white vinegar in the garment bag or inside pants before to also deodorize inside.  Enjoy. I’m getting more.",4
