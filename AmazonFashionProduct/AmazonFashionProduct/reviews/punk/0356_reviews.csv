Overall it seems to be the right size, but it feels all wrong. I am a fit working woman, 5ft 2 160lbs and I usually get a large or an extra large because I have wide hips. This coat was far too long for me, the neck hole in the top is too large, the collar is not flattering, as the 2 triangles puffs they call a collar flap around in random directions, as there is no structure to hold the collar up and not enough fabric around the back of the neck. The hood feels like an afterthought and the strings come out of the side of the neck. It feels like polyester. The inner lining, which If I remember right, many reviewers said did not exist, is slick, bunchy, and ill fitting. The worst part is the sleeves. The part where they tucked in the elbows is bulky and feels awkward. because of this bunching I have no hope of wearing any kind of long sleeve underneath the jacket.  Honestly this feels like kind of jacket you get at a knock off store for $40 because nobody wanted it. I marked it at 3 stars instead of 1 because it generally looks like the photo and while being too long, it fits. This coat is a project and needs to be tailored. It is made for tall women, but I do not believe this would look flattering on anyone. I am returning it.",

It's silly, but there is something SO satisying about being so put together when it's freezing outside. You button this coat up and you are warm and fashionable. And, it does give cold weather Mary Poppins vibes, you can't go wrong. Truly, LOVE this jacket - it's also great because while it looks good when dressed up, a pair of jeans a t-shirt are also a cute outfit - this jacket is amazing. The lining is nice, the pockets are good, the buttons are nice but now that i have worn this jacket a bunch and love it, I will likely trade those buttons in for something nicer.  This jacket is cute, warm, and you WILL get a TON of compliments in it! I have been cozy warm having LONG conversations outside in 15 degree weather. (I live in TX, and while i visit the northeast often, and am originally from the northeast, safe to say, this coat is doing a lot of the work keeping me warm, it's not like i am some super strong resistant to cold badass- the coat does the work- It's a PROPER winter coat!)  Also, can we talk about how freaking amazing the price is? A jacket this warm, this cute? With a HOOD? Silly. Buy the jacket.",11

Rather than a nice weighted worsted wool it feels like Middle-School-Art-Project-Felt.  It hangs terribly. It moves awkwardly.  The lining is some kind of really cheap satin. Feels plasticky. Wrinkly. Not at all smooth or soft. Not attached properly to exterior fabric. Pulls in places. Does not move well with exterior fabric.  The lining sticks out of the cuff when you put your arm in the sleeves. You end up having to tuck it back in. Why was it not stitched down?  The edges of the fabric are stitched so thickly and awkwardly it looks and feels like it was made in Home Ec 101 sewing class by a 13 year old.  I was looking for a stylish, off the beaten path fitted jacket that had some level of femininity in a masculine world. I like the unusual design and I truly believe that this coat made by a real and experienced tailor using higher quality materials is something that could be very beautiful and I would be willing to pay more for.  If you think “well, it’s within my budget and it doesn’t have to be too perfect” you will be very disappointed. This coat is unwearable. It’s embarrassing to be seen in.
