Kristin,Super retro!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RIC1VTMM7PUE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFVYVQ7R,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 15, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Fall,,"I’m a huge lover of autumn and embroidered items so this hat is like the best of both worlds for me. The autumn leaf is a gorgeous color and perfectly sewn, and it looks great with the washed brown color of the cap. The back pulls to size with a little buckle. My husband laughed and me and said I looked silly, partially because I have a tiny head and even with the hat tightened it’s still a little big on me, but I absolutely don’t care if it looks a bit funny due to the vintage styling. I plan on wearing this in summer through late fall every year while outside hiking and doing yard work on sunny days. I think it’s super cute! It reminds me of the kinds of baseball caps my grandpa (born in the 1910s) used to wear back in the 1990s.",
Jamie,Stylish and in Season!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C39EC2Y8N9GW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFVYVQ7R,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 11, 2024",,,"My wife absolutely loves this Halloween Baseball Cap! The embroidered ghost with ""Boo"" and the pumpkin detail add the perfect festive touch without being over the top. The vintage-washed look gives it a cool, laid-back vibe, making it a fun yet stylish choice for the season.  It’s adjustable, so it fits comfortably, and the quality of the stitching is great. She’s been wearing it nonstop, and it’s become her go-to accessory for October outings. Overall, it’s a spooky hit and a five-star addition to her Halloween wardrobe!",

Renn,Thinner than expected…. But wow so soft.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S1YU9JD8JR6G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFVYVQ7R,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 24, 2024",,,"This hat is so cute. The ghost is adorable. I basically live in baseball caps lately. They have truly become my new obsession. I even wear them to work mind you I have a very relaxed office job. Don’t get me wrong this hat is still absolutely 5 stars for quality and comfort, however the material is thinner than my other hats. The bill is as all others I have stuff and pliable as it should be. The cap part is thin but very soft and extremely comfortable so I am pleased. I really like this hat and will add it to my rotation at least for the next month. I need to get the fall leaf one too so I can wear that one longer. Note to seller make a snowflake one so I can have one for winter. Thanks. I’m a huge fan of this hat. It’s a must buy.",
