I was very intentional about selecting the ""fleece"" version. The non-fleece indeed looks like a very light layering peice. Shirt like even. There is a time and place for that! ... just not in my closet. This is indeed fleece. It is not a coat that is cotton and then lined with fleece. Perhaps that was what other reviewers sought? Fleece by itself and not being used as a lining, is indeed a light weight fabric, but it is warm. I'm not going to take it for a trek in the snow, but I live in Northern California and it's lovely for the foothills and valley for every day runabouts. It does flare as well! I bought a large so it would zip over my breasts. I'm 5'5"" and rock a 34-36G so I intentionally size jackets to the most demanding part of me. Picture to be added after I clean my mirrors.",

My brown fleece is okay and I wear it regularly.  I get compliments, but if this is the quality that they are churning out now.  It’s a hard pass.
