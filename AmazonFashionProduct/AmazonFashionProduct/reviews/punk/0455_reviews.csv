It's a blessing for me that this exists as I recently bought a leather jacket covered in studs and needed a hat to match. The hat is very tight. It will cover your whole head but it is an overly snug fit. I find stretching it over a ball or stuffing it with spare tshirts will help loosen it though. Also the spikes do not go all around the hat, they're only on the ""front"". Its also not a thick hat so it wont be the warmest thing on the planet but i think it was clearly designed for style only, not for function. However, it will definitely serve for autumn weather, maybe not the dead of winter though. Overall, a great looking hat for the price.",4
