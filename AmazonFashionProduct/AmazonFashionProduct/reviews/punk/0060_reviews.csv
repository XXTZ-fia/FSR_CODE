brie,Love!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVUK463BT7PXW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKSYNXMQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2025","Size: Suit for waist size 32""-36""Color: Gold Black",Verified Purchase,I do wish I went up a size to have more end on the belt while wearing (was hoping to wear it looped around at the end) but it’s so cute. Totally upgrades a basic outfit. It’s the perfect mix of mainstream and alternative. Unfortunately I’m a gold girly so the silver belts at the thrift just dont scratch my itch for a good studded belt. I’d also consider this work appropriate if your stuck on a business attire,
Katie King,Super cool looking belt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LQCMW3LLV2QR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKSYNXMQ,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025","Size: Suit for waist size 42""-46""Color: Black-gold Rivet",,"Very cool black belt. Great for goth/ punk style outfits. It's a black plastic pleather type belt with big round gold stud along it. It's not super thick but not really thin, kind of a medium thickness. It looks pretty sick with black jeans, or you could wear it over a dress as well. I like that it comes in larger sizes although I did get way too big of a size, that's on me. I took one star off because the fake leather material isn't amazing and I am noticing some small cracks already so I know it won't last as long as a real leather belt would.",
KCD,"Decent quality, size chart is misleading",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R234IGYAR8H8H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKSYNXMQ,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025","Size: Suit for waist size 27""-31""Color: Silver Cofee",Verified Purchase,Product quality was nice and it’s a cute belt.

CrystalLea,A well-made belt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RODI87US8ITRK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKSYNXMQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025","Size: Suit for waist size 42""-46""Color: Black-gold Rivet",,"This is a solid, well made looking belt. I’ve only worn it twice since it came in but I have to say that it looks great and is a good belt, thus far. The leatherwork looks great, solid stitching, and the metal work is gorgeous. The studs are bright and shiny and really pop against that black leather. Fits great with plenty of room to add in a couple of holes, if needed. It’s a good deal for the price!",
Curiosity,Studs and stylized buckle look great; works well as a statement belt in either dressy or punk style,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LOZM0181L17G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKSYNXMQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025","Size: Suit for waist size 32""-36""Color: Black-gold Rivet",,Good:  Nice decorated belt design; studs and stylized buckle look great Works well as a statement belt in either dressy or punk style Black and gold look great together,

ilovenachos,Glam Studded Belt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR3AI9PS5JYQ1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKSYNXMQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025","Size: Suit for waist size 27""-31""Color: Black-gold Rivet",,I rocked this style belt back in the early 2000s (with the requisite low waisted tight jeans) and am delighted they've made a comeback - this time with gold tipped finishing and studs for a chic flair.  The construction is well made - looks much more spendy than it is.  The sizing was accurate for me and I like that there isn't a long overhang of belt leftover once pulled through.  Try it!,

You can’t tell it is faux leather. The rivets give it a fun funky feel. Gold is a nice gold color.,

Redrock,Great dupe for much more expensive versions.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGYCKGSKZIRDU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKSYNXMQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 2, 2024","Size: Suit for waist size 32""-36""Color: Black-gold Rivet",,"This is an excellent-quality dupe for the $580 KHAITE or $78 Madewell versions. I'm between a size 6-8 (28/29 in jeans) and ordered the Black/Gold color in size 32""-36"". It's a soft, flexible material, and the gold-toned hardware is a very realistic gold that's not too yellow or orange. It is PU leather, which won't last forever. But it's well made and a quality product for the price. It's a great alternative to spending much more money on a trendy item that will eventually phase out of style.",8

For one thing, the sizing is 100% accurate, it fits perfectly without a ton of extra flap. It's thick enough to be durable, but thin enough to flex and not be bulky on skinny jeans. I love the studs and hardware, they are shinier than I thought they would be, I was expecting a cheap dull brushed plasticky metal, but these are very nice - real metal with a subtle but glamorous shine. This belt could be styled casual, dressy, punk, steam punk or western...you can get a lot of looks from this one piece. Love it!",2
