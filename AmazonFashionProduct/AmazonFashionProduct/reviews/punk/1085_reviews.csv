All in all I’m disappointed in this purchase and will be returning it.,2

I’m not super small. I’m 5’2 and weigh 130lbs. Normally I wear small-medium. This harness fit loose and awkward. When I tightened the belt in front, it looked lopsided. It wasn’t expensive so I could put additional holes and cut straps but honestly, if I’m going to do all that work I’ll make my own from scratch. With my limited free time that was exactly what I was trying to avoid. I’m disappointed but I went into the purchase knowing that might be the case as it didn’t offer any fitting measurements.",

I’ve tightened every strap to the last available hole, but it’s still too loose on me. I’m probably going to have to punch extra holes in it. There’s a few inches of the straps that just stick out everywhere as well. I don’t want to cut it down, because I don’t want it to look bad, but the way it sticks out doesn’t look good, either, and it runs the risk of catching on any other chains or loose clothing you may be wearing. It does look super cute though, and is very comfortable. I have sensory issues, but the material is soft and not itchy, so I can wear it against bare skin without having any problems.",2
