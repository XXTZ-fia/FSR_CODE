Feels cheap. Took over a month to arrive. Ordered novermber 27th arrived January 3rd.  Wasn't cheap either!,
Tiffany,Poor quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VTRG50WXJ0O5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B099SCLKP5,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 17, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Bought these pants for a dance photo shoot for my son in November. He was so excited to get them and  wore them two times prior. The second time he wore them they tore. The pocket is torn from the zipper unraveling. The rivet is missing and another falling out. The inseam needs to be mended. I contacted the company for replacement and they told me they were worn for a month and a half. Not even close, This is literally what they look like after two wears and washes. They offered me $4 back. I am so Very disappointed since he was so excited to have them. I am now left to repair them the best I can for the photo shoot. Such poor quality and even worse customer service. I have had clothes for years that I wear regularly that don’t rip and pull like these pants do. If you want to wear them more than once then I suggest you find another brand.",

I'd just stick with Tripps, might be pricy but they last!",

Adrian,"Meh. You get what you pay for, I guess.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IKBZ1IZRZEML/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B099SCLKP5,"2.0 "," the United States "," June 26, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"These pants are just... OK. In the images they appear to fit a lot tighter than they really do. The material feels cheap and easy to tear/break, and most of the chains are just cheap plastic, as well. They're still comfortable enough, though.  I guess to wear every once in a while they're all right, but mostly I've just been allowing them to fall deeper and deeper into my closet as I felt pretty disappointed once I actually put them on. If you're wanting some more decent pants, consider paying a bit more elsewhere.",

They fit true to size and looked just like the picture. The chains detach so it makes washing them easier. Love them.,
