Zoe,Fits well if you're a gnome.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OQWWUIRU5T6Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09G6JFBVR,"2.0 "," the United States "," July 18, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Dragon Hoodie,Verified Purchase,"Seriously, this thing is so small. Don't bother unless you're very petite or perhaps a gnome. I ordered a medium, since I'm taller (about 5'9) and my shoulders are a bit broad; and the sleeves were STILL 3-4 inches above my wrist. You can forget about having sweater paws unless you have arms like a t-rex. It's also more cropped than the product images lead me to believe, and I was showing way more ribcage than I felt comfortable with. I don't think ordering a larger size would help either, that's how odd the proportions are on this thing. Oh, did I mention that the dragon design on the sleeves is grey, and not black? I'm only giving two stars because it wasn't falling apart at the seams.",
