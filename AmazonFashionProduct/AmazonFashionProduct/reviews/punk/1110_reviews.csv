Charlotte French,Little tight,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YLPI9RD5F5XM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49KDPND,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 8, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"The lace was a little tight but not terrible and it wore out a little bit through-out the time I was wearing them ( I wore them to a 5/6 hour concert). Very soft and comfortable otherwise but does ride up in front AND back if you’re not careful. They were a little too long for me but that’s not an issue, I’m short so that’s normal.",3
Emese Dravucz,Love these pants!!! But wash it before trying them on because it might stain your skin,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34E1S35E72CTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49KDPND,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 24, 2023",Size: LargeColor: 10#,Verified Purchase,"Wash before wearing, I tried it on when it arrived and it left a blue and black stain on my legs.

tori,"Lace not stretchy, bad for curvy girls",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TWILAFVRJD5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49KDPND,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 13, 2024",Size: LargeColor: 10#,Verified Purchase,I ordered these in my usual size and the legging part fits but the lace cut outs are not stretchy so they are tight on my thighs. It ruins the whole look. I think that sizing up would only make them look baggy. They're cute but I don't think they're for curvy girls,
