It does have a little bit of cheap quality, but I guess I got what I paid for and the neck becomes very loose so just watch out for that.",

Only wish that the arm length were a little bit longer given that I am on the thicker side, so it made it a little shorter as it stretches but otherwise it was perfect as I used it for Halloween to be a bumblebee..",

It fits more like a T-shirt and isn't as long as pictures show but I think that's just a difference in body type. Will definitely be hand washing because the material feels thin.,

I thought overall the sizing was as expected - I found that if you tug on the bottom a bit it gets a lot longer. You can't wear rings or bracelets with this without risking snags, and those snags can get incredibly long so be careful.",3

However, it's not very long, so prepare for that. Also was much larger then I was expecting. Order a size down is what I'd recommend. I love it regardless of it being big. Just can't wear it like a dress like I was intending because it ends right above my hips.",2

It's super soft. The only thing I don't like is the bottom starts to curl up just a little but its still super cute. I've had it for a while now and it still fits amazing",
