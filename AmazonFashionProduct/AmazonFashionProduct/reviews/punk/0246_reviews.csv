I’m pleasantly surprised at the quality especially at the price value. I feel it’s worth it. The fabric has a lot of stretch and it’s not too thin. The craftsmanship is good as well. The graphic print is well done. There’s no broken seams or loose thread. I also like the layered long sleeves look. The sleeves are attached. The fit is as expected and comfortable. I ordered my normal size in clothing. The size chart is reliable as well. Overall great top for lounging or casual outings. I have no complaints. It’s a good purchase.,
