Daniel G.,"Looks cool, cheaply made.  Don't buy if you can't stitch in a better seam.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37BMHMZ9DAG07/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09TNXRGG2,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 31, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"I needed a new jacket, and liked the aesthetic of this one.  Bonus points for being a longer coat.  But the seams were definitely done the cheap way, and some material was fraying off already.  If I didn't know someone to sew in more thread for the seams it was likely to just fall apart over time.  Plus the decals for the coat don't seem safe to wash in a machine - they look and feel like they were ironed on, so I'm scared to actually send this through a wash cycle.There's a couple small things with the pockets being a bit shallow and the zipper being on the wrong side/ the end being a weird shape, but that's stuff isn't a big deal to me.As much as I overall like it, can't recommend buying it to anyone right now unless you or someone you know can reinforce the seams on the bottom of the coat and the cuffs of the sleeves.  It may fall apart if you don't.",4

But I was so hype when I got this tried it on and it fit both zipped and unzipped and I first about is I..... look....good!!! In this jacket!!! It looks just like in the photo not even slightly off what you see is exactly what you're going to get, it's not of those weird, off feeling, cheap poly blend fabrics either this is top notch craftsmanship and effort being put into work here,  and for the price worth every single cent I hope this company can follow this exact sizing for every one of their clothing products  cause there's alot I've seen that I want to buy!!!

This was pretty on par with what I've come to expect from this brand with only a few deviations. First, this is definitely a cool/tepid weather hoodie, NOT a cold/freezing weather hoodie like some of their other styles. The material is quite thin and slightly coarser than the other hoodie I own from this brand. The length is quite long and has a kind of cape effect, which is neat. The printing of the pattern on the hoodie is crisp and clear and well-done. I do think the style is more flattering on feminine body types,  I find it odd that they chose to market this as a Men's style hoodie. Otherwise, no complaints here!",
