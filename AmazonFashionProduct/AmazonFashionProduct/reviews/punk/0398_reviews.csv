Bella,"Super Cute, Quality Belt with Beautiful Silver Accents!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1V3KC4SYF0WVT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMS4KMP1,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 30, 2024",Color: CoffeeSize: Fit Waist Size 32-38 Inches,,"I got this belt a couple of days ago and I wore it all day yesterday and today. It is such a stylish, cool-looking belt. I got the coffee color and I've worn it with both gray/black jeans (as in the photo) and blue jeans. The coffee color is a great, neutral color.  There are so many things I love about this belt. I got it to wear with hip-hugging jeans. It has a LOT of holes, a total of 9, which is far more than most belts, so it is flexible for wearing with jeans that vary in how hip-hugging they are. The detailed silver buckle and the silver end tip have very pretty etching that make the belt especially pretty and high-end looking.  I love the fact that the belt is made of a ""polyurethane leather."" I am a vegetarian and I also never buy leather made from animals. You would have a hard time telling that this isn't real leather. I am thrilled with the quality look and feel of this belt. It looks like it would cost a lot more than it does.",

This is perfect.  The belt is nicely made and the studs are securely fastened.",

hjh,I wish it was the right size....,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R97JHAVIBB623/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMS4KMP1,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 2, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Fit Waist Size 32-38 Inches,,"Its okay for what it is. I guess. The studs seem to be secured good into the PU leather. I guess . It doesn't really matter because It will never fit me. I dont know how I got the size mixed up. I thought I took extra special care to order the correct size but I ended up with one way to big for my waist. So I cant really speak to fit, comfort or durability or much else for that matter...,bummer~!",
