Pamela N.,Very Cute Gloves,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RGOB0Z1DQQ8A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ2MK77W,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 23, 2024",Color: Black/Dark Gray/Brown,,"These gloves are so cute and comfy. The knitting is done very well and they are long enough to go up my arms for warmth. I am not a big glove person, but I need something that doesn't keep my hand and fingers restricted, so these are perfect. Although the hearts are cute and add style, it allows more cold to enter on the skin. Other than that, they are nice and I would recommend them.",
Soozee Q,Lovely and so warm,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RH74MA1SZJY9Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ2MK77W,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 11, 2024",Color: Black/Dark Gray/Brown,,I love these fingerless arm warmers. I can't stand wearing full gloves but I also can't stand cold hands. These are a perfect solution to that. They go on easily and they are long enough that my hands and arms are kept warm. I love the little heart designs that are worked into them giving them a much more than basic style.,
