It has since claimed it's spot as my go-to belt. I'm not sure at what age that became a thing and I'm not sure I like that I have a go-to belt, but I can at least be okay with the actual belt. It's held up to an active job with zero cracks in the material, and no stretching.  I also really appreciate that the holes go around the complete length of the belt. Will I ever need most of them, no, but I have lost a bit of weight this past year and had to punch holes in my old belts. It's nice to know I won't have to do that again and the belt will just fit.  It's also been helpful because there are so many spots to attach tool lanyards. Has saved a few dropsies from the top of a ladder or while climbing through racking.",

It has a great punk rock look with a smooth synthetic leather finish that feels sturdy and well-made. The double grommets give it an edgy style and also make it easy to adjust, so she can wear it comfortably now and, in the future, even if her size changes.  The belt pairs well with jeans and dresses, making it a versatile addition to her wardrobe. The material doesn’t wrinkle or wear easily, which is impressive given the affordable price. The only slight issue is that it has a bit of a leather scent when new but airing it out helped. Overall, it’s a fantastic value for anyone looking for a stylish, durable belt with a cool, edgy vibe!",

The belt buckle is a little different in that it just has a peg on the back to put into the belt hole. I haven't had a belt like that so it was new to me. I am impressed that they also include a hole punch so you can add more if needed. It arrived well packaged and looks just like the photos.,
Ryan Smith,"Very interesting buckle, but sewn in",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYPS7EHNBKDYR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYHJ53RD,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 8, 2024","Color: 03-blackSize: M for Waist 35""-41""",,"I got this because I wear belts and I was attracted to the unusual design of the belt buckle.The sizing is a little odd - it uses your actual waist size rather than your pants size.  I wear a size 32-33 jeans and the medium was just right for me.The buckle is nice, although I would have preferred a satin finish over the super shiny.  It does look good though.  However, the buckle is sewn in.  It's a standard style buckle, but I can't swap it to another belt without cutting it off.  That's a big negative for me.As the description states, the belt is fake leather.  It is soft and very flexible.  Hard to say how durable it'll be.The box it comes in is nice and would make a fine gift box.  It comes with a hole punch tool for making more holes if you need it, I thought that was a nice touch.",
