BuzzyQBee,nice Y2K-KPop look but swishy material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YKT4A13UWRN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D59P1NS9,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 18, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black and Pink,,"Sounds & feels more like 100% nylon than the polyamide fabric it's supposed to be, according to its Amazon product description. Like swishy basketball athlete pants. It's saved by the cute pink bows with the narrow pink lining on its sides. Or my daughter would've nixed this due to its swishy & not the most comfortable material. Fit was great on her. Got her the Medium for her 5'5 pear-shaped figure that fits a size M-L or 10-12. Hem was perfect on her.  Moderately recommended.",
