It fit exactly how I wanted it to, and strangely looked exactly like the picture even though the mediums did not. I can't really complain cuz I like how they look, but just a heads up! If you want it to look exactly like the picture, order a large!!!  They definitely do fit to size. I got the size that I normally would, as I've never bought pants on amazon before, and they fit perfectly but I really wanted that baggy look instead. I'm returning it for a bigger size, so get a bigger size if you want it to be baggy! The button hole also wasn't cut open, so you have to cut it open yourself. The stars on the pants aren't made with as much quality as the photos, but they're not that bad and still cool looking if you don't mind the grungey look! Overall, yeah, I like them.",
