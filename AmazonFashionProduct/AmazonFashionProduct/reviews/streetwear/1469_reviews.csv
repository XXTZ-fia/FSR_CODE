It is not flowy and has an awkward fit and the overall design is nothing like the image. It's not comfortable if you have a larger chest. It looks like a mix of scrubs and athleisurewear nothing like the picture or description. DO NOT GET THIS.",

ItIsSo,Like It But It Doesn't Fit Right,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34BPUBGT5FGHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BRSR5LBC,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 26, 2024",Size: LargeColor: I-claret,,"My wife really likes the material, nice and soft and smooth feeling. She likes the super long sleeves and bell cuffs. She likes the length. It fits kind of snug but is advertised as slim fitting so no problem. The problem comes in that it doesn't fit at all in the chest. The cup area is too small and the seam across the chest hits in the middle of her breasts. It just doesn't look right at all. If you are a smaller person and small chested it might work for you, but not in our case.",
Mira,Not worth the price.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSQGLVCKE4S1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BRSR5LBC,"2.0 "," the United States "," August 7, 2024",Size: LargeColor: I-claret,Verified Purchase,"This shirt isn't worth the price in my opinion. It's cute, but does run small so size up 2 times. The material is thin but not see through and feels compressive in the arms.  In all it feels like a 3 dollar shirt from shein. It is cute but for over 10 dollars I don't think it's worth it.",

I wear between medium and large shirts. I got the medium, and it was really small. I don't even think the large would have fit. I barely got it over my head but could not pull it down very far. It's too bad because the shirt looked nice out of the package.",

It's not too thin, but it's very 90's. I remember this style way back then and love the fit. The sleeves are long and flared, so perfect for those of us who want to hide our hands. The neck V shape is low but when paired with a camisole or tank top- like the 90's- it's an awesome shirt. Size is true to fit.",
