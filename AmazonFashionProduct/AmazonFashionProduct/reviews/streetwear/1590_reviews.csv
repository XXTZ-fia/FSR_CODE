It’s soft, cozy, and fits perfectly. The style is on point with its skull and fairy grunge graphic, and the fabric has a good amount of stretch, making it super comfortable for all-day wear. She loves how unique the design looks with her outfits, and it pairs well with a variety of accessories.  The only issue was that the material is thinner than expected, so it’s more suitable for layering or milder weather. Overall, it's a great shirt for anyone into that vintage, edgy aesthetic. A total win for a Y2K-inspired wardrobe!",

I have a really hard time finding long sleeve shirts that are skinny enough in the mid section, yet long armed to my wrists or to my waistline. This had both! For reference, I'm 5'8"" but about 112lb. Mediums usually have the fit for that criteria, but are too big in the middle. So, I usually have to go small and hope for the best or go Medium and it is oversized. This fit, in a small! It deffinatly won't be warm enough in winter, but would be good in fall depending on your cold comfort level. I have washed this twice and it's held up well. I find the material rather itchy, I do however have sensitive skin. I think with a tank top underneath it might be ok. I would buy again, it is a good deal for the price, but if you have sensitive skin it may be worth considering a different fabric.",

It’s very thin with no print on the underside of the garment. The material isn’t soft at all and made with some type of spandex and it clings to every roll and imperfection on your body. I would not wear it outside the house for this reason.  I was looking for something more loose and comfy to fit like it does in the model in the photo. I’d have to buy it a couple sizes too big for it to fit like that.  It’s a shame because the print is nice and it could have been a great shirt otherwise.",

The seams have a raw finish. This is a problem at the hem, where the lack of a true hem causes the bottom to roll up. The material is thin, probably not warm enough for cold weather wear.
