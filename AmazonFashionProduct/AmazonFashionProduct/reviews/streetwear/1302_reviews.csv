Until now, I always went on board in my regular clothing and changed into the pajamas airlines provide on board.  But, with ever-shrinking bathroom size even in premium cabins, it has become more and more challenging to change on board!  But I don’t want to board in my pajamas like a slob…  I thought about wearing tracksuits but I haven’t been able to find one that wouldn’t corrupt my style.  For instance, those by companies like Adidas and Under Armour are too athletic-looking (and the fabric, too rough) for my taste and others (e.g., Gucci, Dior, etc.) are comfortable yet too ostentatious.That’s when I found these pants with a matching jacket—that look sufficiently presentable yet feel like pajamas!  It worked perfectly on my recent trip to Japan!  I changed into these at the lounge before boarding and, upon arrival, I simply went to the airport bathroom on the way to the customs to change—rather than change in tiny bathrooms on board.  At this price point, in particular, I couldn’t be happier!",2

The White stripe on the outside of the legs: it's too wide - make it narrower.  2. The leg opening flares out even though there are zippers. You have the zippers, add elastic and tailor the opening.  3. Zippered Pockets. The pockets are nice and BIG. But all pants this style, need zippered pockets these days.  The final thing that would improve this product are the pockets themselves, when wearing these pants - keep in mind that they fit me perfect, if not slightly loose - the pockets are wide open. I haven't worn them out yet, but I'm already worried about things falling out. It will definitely happen when driving. Walking, they should be okay - the pockets are very deep.",2
