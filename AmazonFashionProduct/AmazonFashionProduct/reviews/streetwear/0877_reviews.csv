Personally, I love them. I will say that the sizing can be.....inconsistent. I have a couple pairs that are just slightly too small around the waist. I just bought a button extender to fix the issue.  The pants are heavy, thick, and will take longer in the drier if you have a lot of them drying at once.  The stitching isn't super amazing, there are definitely some threads hanging about where the pockets are, but I just cut them off and haven't had any issues.",

Claire Torres,Tall girl friendly!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R87288NL3Q1NS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYH59MW3,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 23, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,"Size: I’m 5’7.5”, inseam 30”, waist 26”, hips 37”, 135 lbs. Size S fit me perfectly, especially the length! The waist is a little too loose to be super high waisted the way I like, so I added a belt. Without the belt they sit about 1 inch lower than what you see in my pics.  Comfort/fabric: Fabric is 95% cotton, it’s veryy comfy and breathable. It’s light fabric, so they are not suited for super cold weather - you could layer leggings under them if needed. They are not see through at all. Did not shrink after washing and machine drying. The buttons feel a little cheap but tbh if they fall off I’ll just replace them.  Style: Even cuter than I thought! The pockets don’t have buttons or zippers so you probably won’t want to put valuable things in them. The ankle ties aren’t drawstrings, but you can still tie them tight - it’ll just tie some of the fabric itself if that makes sense.  Overall I’m sooo so pleasantly surprised with these pants!! I’ve been looking for good cargos everywhere and finally found them :’) I highly recommend!",3

I got a medium and it was a tad small, but I can deal with it. I should have ordered a size up. The inseam of these are 30""... so definitely not for tall people. The hem can be let out for another inch or so. Haven't done it yet so I don't know it you lose the strings or not. Either way, I don't care for the strings, they are longer than expected and I am a walking trip hazard. I haven't washed it yet, so don't know if it shrinks. But I will be sticking to a low heat just in case because if it gets any smaller, I wont be able to wear it. No stretch to the fabric so I hope the person wearing it wont be too curvy; wouldn't be ideal. The zipper is kinda cheap, I am definitely afraid my fupa will take over and destroy it. The fabric is almost like a jean material but a bit softer. The fabric is pretty thick. It looks good on. Hugs the bottom nicely and the pockets make it look decent (for all you ""flat tires"" out there like me, thimbs up). On me the top of the pant sits just at my belly button.

If you're on the hunt for the perfect blend of comfort and style, look no further.  First and foremost, the design is a total fashion win. The high waist adds a trendy touch, and the baggy cargo style is not only comfortable but incredibly stylish. These jeans strike the perfect balance between casual and chic, making them a versatile addition to any wardrobe.  The fit is fantastic. The high waist is not only on-trend but also flattering, accentuating the waistline in all the right ways. The baggy fit provides a relaxed feel without sacrificing the overall silhouette, and the cargo pockets add a cool and functional element to the design.  I can't get enough of the quality. The denim feels sturdy and durable, and the attention to detail in the stitching is evident. Despite the baggy fit, the jeans maintain a structured look that doesn't compromise on style.  I also appreciate the versatility of these jeans. They can be dressed up with a chic blouse and heels or rocked casually with sneakers and a tee. The possibilities are endless, and that's what makes them such a wardrobe staple.  If you're in the market for cute and stylish jeans that tick all the boxes, these High Waist Baggy Cargo Jeans are a must-have.
