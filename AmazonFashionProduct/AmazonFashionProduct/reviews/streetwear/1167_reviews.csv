Duck,Looks nice but falls apart easily,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16JTX59XL7L0L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C3RNMLZ9,"1.0 "," the United States "," March 7, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Green,Verified Purchase,The design is nice but the threads holding it together rip easily even when it's the right size. Beyond the seems ripping the vinyl designs on the pants starts coming off after the first wash and feels like it can't adhere to the pants fabric itself. You'll need to sew the green strap on the left leg so it stops coming undone from the buckle it's on.  Other than these issues at least the pants look nice if you know how to repare it,

You have the two on your sides, and one on the front of your left thigh. I don't like the left thigh pocket because I am afraid my wallet will fall out of it when I am out and about.",

Wish there was a better way to keep the strap in place though, like an additional D ring or something would work maybe.
