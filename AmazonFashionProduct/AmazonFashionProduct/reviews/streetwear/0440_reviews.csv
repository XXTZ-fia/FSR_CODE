I will admit they were on sale for $10 when I bought them, but even if I had paid the full amount, they are nice enough! 28W 29L I'm 5'2 130lb These are baggy low riders on me There are also zippers at the bottom of the pant legs, not sure if for function or style. Big sturdy cargo and butt pockets but the hip pocket material is SUPER THIN, and I can see runs in it (like nylons) and I haven't even used them yet! Strange, considering the rest is such great quality.",

I assumed the length would be fine because a 29 inseam typically touches the ground on me, but I absolutely cannot wear these pants. they are clearly high waters and definitely not 29inches long. The pants I received are only 26.5 inches long inseam as you can see in the photo with the measuring tape although I purchased 29 inches L.

I wanted them to be extra baggy and still be able to put them in the dryer.  These cargo pants are 100 percent cotton, and I have plenty experience laundering clothes.  Unless the clothes are made with pre-shrunk cotton by the manufacturer, you can expect shrinkage in the dryer.  These pants shrunk very little.The ‘streetware’ style of the pockets are exactly what you would expect in a cargo pant; the front pockets are very large and deep - 8 inches long and 6 1/2 inches wide.  The cargo pockets below have the traditional flap measuring a generous 8 inches wide and 3 inches long - the entire pocket is 8 inches x 8 inches, quite large.The straight leg on the pant has a 6 3/4 inch zipper  at the bottom of the pant on the outside of the leg area.  If you prefer a flared leg you can unzip the sides to allow for that particular look.  There are also back pockets measuring  5 inches x 5 inches.One design element unique to these pants is raw edgings, which gives the pants a unique style.  The zipper fly and metal button / buttonhole in front of the pants is the same as a typical  pair of jeans.  The cotton is a durable grade and the look is very stylish.These cargo pants are well made.  The seller recommends to hand wash only.  I actually turned them inside out because of the raw edge design and washed them in cold and put them in the dryer on low.

Love all the details and distressed pockets with zippers at the ankles. Threw them on with some converse and a T-shirt but you could really style them however you want. A big comfy sweatshirt would be cute! Sizing seems very generous especially if you carry weight in your tummy booty or hips. Just get them! I used a coupon for $10 off also,5

Incredibly to short well above the ankle, because of flare and zippers on the sides of pants you can't make at home modifications. If you don't have long legs or a long torsos they'll fit.
