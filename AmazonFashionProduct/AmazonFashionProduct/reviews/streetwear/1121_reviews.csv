Molly Clawson,Too small!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7DZBVBV60G8W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8KN95TL,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 17, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I'm definitely not average or skinny, but cmon. If you advertise it as a MEN'S large, it should fit me, a female who wears XL in pants, as a Large. I shouldn't have to order a 5XL or whatever to fit into pants. Asian brands need to understand that if they're selling internationally, not all of us have A5 waists and stick-thin legs. Please update your sizes and mention it's Asian sizing. This made me incredibly self-conscious about my weight, and I'm tempted not to buy them again. But they are so pretty looking and feel like genuine pants, so I'm gonna buy them again at the biggest size to see if they fit.",
David Matovich,"High quality, functional and comfortable pants",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VOA1LWKO7YLA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8KN95TL,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 13, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"I bought these for my teenage daughter. They feel very well made. The material is thick and feels durable. Below is my daughters review.  They're really nice. They're pretty flattering, for cargo pants. They feel really high quality and the fabric feels thick. As a female, it's super nice to have multiple deep pockets. It just feels really well made.",

Rosie Crystal,Nice fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AZFURDTQH5AG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8KN95TL,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 29, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,,These fit nicely and are a durable denim fabric. They come with straps that snap on in different positions. One of the snaps is broken and I can't use the strap so they look weird.,
Chris S.,Cute look but sizing is way off!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39AL03NU8XCLB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8KN95TL,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 20, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,,These are nice quality pants. My daughter was so excited to get them. When they arrived I noticed right away that they were good quality and was excited to see her try them on. They were a good 2 to 3 sizes too small. I chose size according to size chart. I recommend sizing up for sure.,
EFloyd,Cute jeans…definitely for youngsters,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20AYBRMFLF23P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8KN95TL,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,,I ordered these for my daughter and for sure they are her style. I pulled them out of the package and wondered what I had done…but she squealed with delight (14 years old for reference). For some reason I read chargers pants and thought they’d be a canvas type fabric but these are denim Jean material. They are very cute and have lots of pockets. There are little pockets with buttons on the backs of the knees which I thought would be annoying but I was quickly informed I was just uncool. But it’s something to know if you have a kiddo that would be bothered by that. The loops snap on and off and are high quality. The waist button is a little wiggly and I expect it to pop off but it’s easily fixed (and honestly something I fix on a lot of pants!) overall super cute and fit very well.,
