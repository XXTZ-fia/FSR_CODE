Threw them in the wash and there wasn't a trace of the cargo pocket. Only problem is - now there are no side pockets, lol. The straps are cool, they're remind me of seat belt material.

I also like how it's thick but not too thick or stiff.  The length for me is perfect. I bought an xs, I'm 411 and about 120 ibs.  The price is decent.Okay, let's talk about the straps and buckles.  The straps are like off of a backpack.  It's the vibe I'm getting from it, not the greatest.  Also, the buckles came in a small bag, not attached to the overalls.  You definitely need to add the buckles yourself.  The quality of the hardwares and buckles are very low.  I feel like it'll break or fall apart.  Just flimsy.I was reaching for the straps and broke the stitching on the strap.  Wasn't too thrilled when that happened.I wanted to also mentioned, there was lose treads.  And the stitching was off.  It's not bothersome because it's either hidden or less noticeable. The was treads I had to trim off.Its not a bad overall if you want to look pass all the flaws.",13
