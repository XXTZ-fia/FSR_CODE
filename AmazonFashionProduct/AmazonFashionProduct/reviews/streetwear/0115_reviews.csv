I'm 6'3, 160 something lbs, and length-wise they're about midway between my knee and ankle. I got the US XXL. I'm giving them 4 stars for 2 reasons..  The first is just that they don't initially feel as soft as I was expecting. Perhaps after washing them they'll be softer and even more comfortable though. They feel fine, just not quite what I was expecting.  Second and main reason is the faux back pockets. There are slits in the back for pockets, but it's just sewn shut. There aren't actually back pockets. I really don't understand why someone would make the slits as if they were going to add back pockets, but then not actually add pockets.. I'm really tempted to cut the slits open and attempt to sew in my own back pockets lol.. This isn't a huge deal, but it seems so ridiculous to me that the slits are there, but the pockets aren't. If there were no slits, and I hadn't expected back pockets because it looks like it has them, then this wouldn't have bothered me as much. xD",4
