lspswr,Cute pants but a bit long for small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O8IHD5JDPHAN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8Y84HCZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 19, 2024",,,"I like these pants and they're super cute. The cargo style is ""feminized"" with the horizontal knee pleats. The length was a bit long for us, and the stretchy material needed a belt in order to stay up. The pockets are awesome and the wide legs are really cute. With a belt these worked, but without it they were too long and too stretchy. The pants washed well and did not wrinkle. Very pleased, with a belt.",
Vine Customer,Large fits really well,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRNL2JN3SY306/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8Y84HCZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 13, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,,"Wow! If you can get these at $16.99 as advertised right now, swoop them up! I got the large size based on the chart. The pants fit me really well. Not tight at all. You can definitely feel the material is polyester. I like that they have a button and zipper fly. The pleated seams across the legs makes these cargo pants interesting among other cargo styles. The pants were fairly easy to steam the wrinkles out. I wore with some chunky black sneakers. The length hits at my ankles, perfect length. I'm 5' 8"", 165 lbs, 31"" waist 42"" hips.",
A.J,Favorite cargo pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L4FU2BNAEGRK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8Y84HCZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 11, 2024",Color: PinkSize: Medium,,"Right now they are my favorite cargo pants, I got the pink one and it is exactly as show in the pictures, I am petite and I am glad it fits me as normal pants all the way to then ankle, or if you are tall it would be a little bit shorter but still looking great on you for sure. They are very well made and the fabric feels nice, It is comfortable to wear and the price is great! I will be ordering the black ones too because I want another par of cool looking cargo pants, and the price is great. I like the extra pockets and how deep they are.",

They are very stretchy though and have a button and zipper. I love the material and the cargo pockets on the side. There are still normal pocket which is great. Overall they are very comfortable, well made and super cute but check your sizing when you order.",2
Hypnoglitter,Size up if in doubt!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GCFE7ZZD26BR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8Y84HCZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 2, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,,"I got these because I am desperate for pants, and thought these would be great for Fall/Winter walks with my dog.  These are a thick polyester with a bit of stretch. The fabric is not the soft, buttery type, it's definitely polyester and feels like it. The construction is solid, though. I think they'll last. The pockets are pretty flat.  It was hard to get a pic since they're black, but I tried to at least show the fit. I'm 5'6"",153lbs, 41/32/41"" and got large. They are quite tight on me compared to the fit on the model, for sure, so size up if you want loose as pictured, especially around the hips/butt. Since they are tight, I will feel whatever I put in the pockets against my leg, and it will bulge out a bit.  So, I think I will use them, I will update if they don't perform as expected in the wild. They just don't have a flowy look on me like I hoped given my shape.  Recommend with the sizing caveat to get larger if you want the softer, flowy look.  3 stars is my standard rating if an item is as described and meets my needs. I gave this 4 stars because these pants seem to be well made compared to some other items in a similar price range.",4
