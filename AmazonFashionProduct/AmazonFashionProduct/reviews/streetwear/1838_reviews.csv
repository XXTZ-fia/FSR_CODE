It's not an oversized or boxy-fit style which is what I was hoping for, but a nice cut all the same. I will probably modify them, as I find them to be a bit long. All the colors are well done and I've been happy with all of them. I am planning to apply an assortment of materials to each shirt.

JLangley,a great purchase was made,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28B88IM782RSG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRYPWNB2,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 4, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black+grey+khaki,,"model is 6'4"" 215 pounds wearing a size XL. The best thing about these shirts is the value to get three of them for such a low price. I am particularly fond of how soft and comfortable they are, and they even have a little bit of stretch. the only thing that I would possibly change is the collar is a little bit tight, but it can be loosened by stretching it out. These are great shirts to wear around the house.",4

That being said, this is a great find.  I had been wearing No Boundaries oversized Ts, but those have become hard to find.  These are just as good, if not better than those.  I ordered them a size smaller than I normally wear, and they still have that oversized comfortable feeling that I look for in an oversized T.  The colors are great and they are well built so they should last several years.  I highly recommend these as they are also a great value!",

The product description mentions the colors as black, gray, and blue, but the “blue” shirt is actually purple. This was disappointing, as I was expecting a true blue shirt, not something that looked completely different upon arrival.  Additionally, the washed vintage look isn’t consistent across the three shirts. While one shirt had a slight vintage vibe, the others lacked that effect almost entirely. The quality and fit are fine, but the misleading color and inconsistent design make this a less satisfying purchase than I had hoped for.  If you’re very particular about color accuracy and design details, I’d suggest looking elsewhere.",
