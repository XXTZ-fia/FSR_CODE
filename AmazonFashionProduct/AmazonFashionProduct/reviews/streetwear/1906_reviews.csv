EmCEllis,Looks cool in the pic but IMPOSSIBLE to tie,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32JP00EP9B20U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BZP477TN,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 1, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Rainbow,Verified Purchase,"There are four front ties and two back ties, so there's no way to actually tie it. I tied three of the front ties together to tie them to the one back tie they line up with, but the cords are so slippery, trying to make four of them stay together in one knot was so difficult and also looked like an ugly stringy knot. So annoying. Still gave it two stars because the material was comfortable and despite all the issues, I got several compliments when I wore it out. Never wanted to wear it again though, too much hassle.",

I usually wear an M for tops like these, but I decided to listen to the reviews and size up to an L. It fit well! I would say if you're on the fence, size up.  The material isn't very thick or supportive, but that can't really be expected from a top like this. You can adjust the straps in many different ways to create different looks, which really adds to its unique pattern and cut. I would definitely recommend it if you want a cute top that helps you step out of your comfort zone or if you want a fun addition to your wardrobe.",4
