Fit: way off. - I have multiple shirts that are oversized and heavy weight and they are all XL. Normally in a regular shirt I would wear a L but I like the over sized fit better. I would say this is an American Large and NOT XL. I’m a big dude, big chest and back and big arms. These XLs were slightly tight on the chest but tighter around my arms vs my other XLs where I have atleast a fists worth of space.  If you are looking for Oversized heavy weight( which these are not heavyweight) shirts than either go 1-2 sizes up. If you wear a L regular shirt then 2XL would be better but wait…. XL is the largest they have.",
