Wisconsin customer,Description is not accurate,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MQGFJKNBCJGZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4B16GHJ,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,This product is way off on size chart and description.  Not the loose/baggy I wanted. Ordered a large according to the size chart. They were more like the skinny joggers kids are wearing today. Not what I wanted.,
David Powell,These fall apart!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L529VZCI1V06/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4B16GHJ,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,These were worn a few times when they split open in the bottom. The fabric frayed away so they couldn’t be restitched.,
Luis,Not too baggy not to tight,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25484JDP688D9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4B16GHJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 13, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,The pants wait time is pretty long but when I got them they were better then I thought. Fabric was thinker then I thought too so over all when unbox it was 8/10,
Dan,Skinny pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HJ1FUIMLBWV4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4B16GHJ,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 12, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,My kiddo is skinny and these pants were snug. I’d recommend shopping elsewhere or order 2 sizes larger.,
Levon Grigoryan,Great product (be aware of sizing),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NX7W2O5Y0QUJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4B16GHJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 19, 2024",,,"The pants look great and all but I'd suggest going one size smaller than you normally would get. I ordered a medium and it looks like a large, all I can say is that they definitely weren't joking about the ""wide leg"" part.",5
