Filigree Star,For someone with very long arms,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LBVBVWVIKIJP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXTYKP1,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Color: Dark GreySize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I bought this for hubby. He needed some new dress shirts and I had hoped he would like this one because it looked comfortable and would not need ironing. It absolutely is very comfortable, he sais, and it comes out of the drying with no wrinkles. Unfortunately, the medium size we purchased, and we purchased more than one of this brand, has very long arms. A medium should have had arms between 22 and 23 inches long. The sleeves on both of the shirts we bought from COOFANDY are 26 inches long. He litterally can roll the cuff back and have it the correct length. This would not be such a problem I suppose if he wore a jacket but he does not. We will have to pay someone to alter the sleeves to the proper length, increasing the overall cost of the shirt not to mention the time he will have to take at the tailor. In summary, not worth the purchase.",

Colors are not the ones you see in the pictures,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15SDJ9QJR311D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXTYKP1,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 7, 2024",Color: Dark BlueSize: Medium,,"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐  Stylish and Comfortable: Men’s Long Sleeve Button Down Chambray Shirt  I recently added the Men’s Long Sleeve Button Down Chambray Shirt in Dark Blue (Medium) to my wardrobe, and it has quickly become one of my go-to shirts for both casual and business settings. Here’s why I’m giving it a solid four stars:  First, the style of this shirt is excellent. The dark blue chambray fabric gives it a modern yet classic look that works well for a variety of occasions. Whether I’m dressing up for a business meeting or keeping it casual for a night out, this shirt fits the bill perfectly. The untucked design adds a relaxed vibe, while still looking polished and put-together.  The fit is true to size. I ordered a Medium, and it fits me just right—not too tight and not too loose. The cut is flattering, and the shirt drapes nicely without being baggy. The long sleeves are the perfect length, and the cuffs have just the right amount of room for comfort without looking oversized.  One of the standout features is the comfort. The chambray fabric is soft and breathable, making it ideal for all-day wear. It feels great against the skin and doesn’t cause any irritation, even during warmer days. The fabric also has a bit of a textured look, which adds to the overall aesthetic appeal.  The pocket is a nice touch, providing a bit of extra functionality without detracting from the shirt’s sleek look. It’s great for holding small items like a pen or business cards when needed.  The only reason I’m not giving this shirt five stars is due to the slight wrinkling after washing. While it’s not a major issue, the shirt does require a bit of ironing or steaming to maintain its crisp appearance. A bit more wrinkle resistance would have been a nice addition, but it’s a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things.  In summary, the Men’s Long Sleeve Button Down Chambray Shirt in Dark Blue is a stylish, comfortable, and versatile addition to any wardrobe. It works well for both casual and business settings, and the fit and fabric quality are impressive. Despite the minor wrinkle issue, I’m very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others looking for a reliable and fashionable shirt.",
