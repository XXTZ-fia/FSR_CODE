AA,Just as pictured,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KTE0AK8LFQKG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSSVD237,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 13, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Cherry-white,Verified Purchase,"This is a true baby tee. I’m a size 10/12 and normally wear an XL. I purchased and it fit like a youth large. The fabric is 95/5% poly/ spandex. it’s thick soft and stretchy good quality T-shirt fabric. unfortunately it was waaay too small for me, the sleeves and body silhouette are cut like a true 90s baby tee and it would be best suited for petite women. The graphic printed is good quality and has an intentional pixelated CMYK style print. I wish it fit me!",5
