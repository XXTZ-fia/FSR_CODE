It's a great quality shirt and well made too. The shirt is really comfortable and fits me great. I love oversized shirts so it's always a plus for me when shirts are made that way. I love the print on it too. I hope it lasts for a long time. It hasn't shrunk from being in the dryer. This is a great shirt and has no flaws in my eyes.,

A.

The design itself is expertly screen printed with no deviations in the margins. I have received tons of compliments on this uniquely designed t-shirt. Would recommend.",
D. Zebrowski,I liked this more than I thought I would,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11P8DRW1E54BV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CR2XLZMH,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 8, 2024",,,"First, the shirt, while listed at 100% cotton, doesn't quite feel that way. It's got a much more blended feel, not nearly as soft as an all-cotton shirt typically feels. That being said, it is quite a nice, solid quality shirt, having a good, substantive feel. It might be a bit thick for some of the hotter weather, to each their own. For me, I found it simply feeling better and better as I wore it.  It felt a bit stiff at first, and yet I warmed up to it rather quickly, and appreciated the high-quality feel of it more and more. As for the design, I was wondering if it would be a bit much. That too quite quickly faded into the background, and yet not without having some style and distinction.  All told, I wasn't sure how I would feel about this shirt, and yet it has quite easily vaulted into my top tier of tee-shirts to wear. Easy shirt to recommend.",

phil,stylish quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R192E54KZJE4E4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CR2XLZMH,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 5, 2024",,,"This shirt looks great, and its good quality as well.  Its a pretty thick material as far as t-shirts go, so its not the thin, breathable type.  Its like a thick and sturdy, good quality cotton type feel.  (and I see...literally 100% cotton.)  Size wise I go between Med-Large as I am stocky build, went with the large, and I find it fits me quite well.  (I like a loose-fit so I always default to large unless I suspect european or other sizing.)  So no such issues here...fits well, looks great...very good quality.  Love it.",

The design is cool and the materials are nice, it's just one of those shirts that's atypically sized.  If you're looking for a bit more room and a slightly shorter shirt than normal, this could be a good one for ya.",6
