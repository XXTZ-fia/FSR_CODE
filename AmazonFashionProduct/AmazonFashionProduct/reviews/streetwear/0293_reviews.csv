vinnie,"BEAUTIFUL wash, fits well.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31LUB09UV743N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWRZM1PZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,"The fabric quality is great, and there is no odor. The pants are a little short, but the wash is absolutely beautiful, and they over all look very good on me. They have a little bit of a bell at the bottom, which, if you’re short, will look very baggy as advertised, and if you are taller, they will not touch your feet, but they will still look nice. I suggest them!",
