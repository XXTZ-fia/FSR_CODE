It’s my favorite! Definitely size up, I like my jackets kinda big on me. Honestly if you’re like me, I suggest sizing up by two. I wear a Large but I only sized up by one and got the XL. It’s not that I’m not happy with it, it’s just that I’d like it slightly bigger. I’m 5’6 and 118 pounds so I’m pretty thin. Also the color and quality is so beautiful, I love this jacket soooo much! I hope I can get more in different colors!",4

The jacket had a lot of loose threads and cardboard on the inside of the jacket, on the inside of the stars. Putting it in the washing machine made more threads come loose all over the jacket, but it didn't really affect the jacket itself (nothing fell off or came undone). The jacket survived a washing and drying cycle on the washing machine and the dryer on a normal cycle for dark clothes and it did not shrink. It is also extremely comfortable. I wore it for 3 days before putting it in the machine and it held up quite well, even in winter. Would reccomend, but I wish the company would focus on the quality of the jacket a bit more to prveent the loose threads.  Edited to add: I had to size up. I fit as an S inmost stores, and bought an M. It is a little oversized but fits quite well.",
