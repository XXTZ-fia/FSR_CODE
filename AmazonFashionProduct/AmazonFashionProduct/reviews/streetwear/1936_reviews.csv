While it's lightweight since it's not made of cotton or fleece, it's perfect for those cooler days.  The designs are tasteful and stylish, not over-the-top.

It's not super thick like a fleece crewneck, but it's lined and definitely something that you can layer in the fall to stay warm. The color is nice and the design elements seem to be quality and haven't shown any wear or tear as I've washed this.  I will say that the lining isn't super breathable and feels very synthetic and almost rubbery. I've found that this makes it take much longer to air dry after a wash. All of that being said, I'm not convinced that this garment is worth the price its listed at. This crewneck is comfortable enough and I like the style of it, but it's not like there are many fine details that make it worth it at this price point. It's a generic print on a long sleeve crewneck - nothing ""vintage"" about it and nothing outstanding about the construction or design.  I will update my review should anything change with the quality over time as I wear it, but after a month of wear I like this crewneck just fine, but not enough to justify the price. The construction is solid but not really what I expected for a list price of $46.",

This is very different and has a different look, feel, and drape to it. The bottom does not have a band and is open - just something to note from a style perspective. It's not a bad top, but is not what I was expecting. It is not a t-shirt, as it is much heavier.",

I decided that I really needed to add it to my winter wardrobe, and I'm glad I did. First off, consult the size chart for more accurate sizing. I normally wear a large, but after viewing the size chart, I decided to drop down a size, and the medium fit just as I'd expect a large to fit. If you like really baggy/loose clothing, order your normal size because this is truly oversized. The sweatshirt itself is very well made with seams finished properly and no hanging threads. The fabric itself is interesting -- it feels very soft on the outside, kind of like it's brushed. I really love the feel! All in all, this is a very comfortable sweatshirt that looks great on me. I will be wearing it frequently all fall and winter!",
