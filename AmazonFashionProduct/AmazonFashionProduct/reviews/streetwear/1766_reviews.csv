Abby Wyatt,Shorter than expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL9PA85O1753W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09V2RDGHC,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,"I normally think of baby tees hitting right at my belly button whereas cropped would be shorter so this fits more like a crop top, I think. It is still so cute though and I wear it often.",
Lulu Calkins,Cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QZK52M0HUTWR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09V2RDGHC,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 16, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,"I liked the tee, and I wear it. The only thing I will say is the material is quite weird, it is not cotton like at all. The sleeves cut off strangely, and I don't like having my shoulders highlighted so. Over all it is a 3/5.",
Dora the Explorer,Surprisingly not bad.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GS7J5MMIZ0SG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09V2RDGHC,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 13, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I'm a 38C, typically a L/XL, 5'2"", and 187lbs. I bought this in a large and was pleasantly surprised at how cute it turned out to be. It's definitely cropped and sits above my belly button slightly, but the cut of the shirt is cute. The material is cotton-y, but the shiny cheap type, which I expected when buying it. The lettering is not those weird shiny, ironed on letter either, which is great. I bought this for an Olivia Rodrigo concert and I think it'll do just fine for the purpose, but I don't think I'll wear it outside of that since it is pretty low quality.",

This top was surprisingly high quality and the letters have stayed on well, and are not super shiny or cheap looking like I thought they’d be. Feels like a nice cotton shirt with a lot of stretch to it, didnt shrink too much in the wash either. If you’re looking for a tighter fit then size down.",
