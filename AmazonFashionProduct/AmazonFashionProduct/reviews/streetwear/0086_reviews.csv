Patience Lavoie,Looks cheap! Poor quality! Save your money!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R110YINIGON943/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK715KJL,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Color: Pumpkin Halloween ShirtSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I really wanted to love this Halloween top. Unfortunately, the look, feel and fit is much lower quality in person than the listing suggests. It looks like something you'd buy on Temu for $3.99. The shape is poorly tailored as Temu clothes tend to be (as if they didn't measure it on an actual human), and the print looks like a photo scan. The material is the type that will pill almost right away in the wash, and the fabric has an off-putting strong chemical smell. The fact that they normally charge  $29.99 for this is insane. I paid $9.99 on off-season sale and still feel like I got taken for way more than the garment is worth. Will be returning!",
