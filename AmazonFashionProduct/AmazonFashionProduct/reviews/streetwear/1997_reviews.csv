Anonymous37,Run big,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AXMAABFXBCHW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK9J1J1Z,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2025",Color: 1-blackSize: X-Large,,"These pants are great. I just ordered a size too big. I wish I would have ordered a size smaller than my size. But they look good anyway; they're a great material, they're crisp and they feel good in the wind. I can't complain.  SPECIAL NOTE: As an approved Amazon Vine member with Gold status, I am trusted to select items for review (sometimes from a list of almost 130,000 options). Many of these items are new to the market, or a seller simply wants some additional exposure for their product. I am NOT required to review every item in exchange for receiving and trying it out. I only order products that are important to me (ones I know I have an interest in and will use), and always strive to provide an honest evaluation of my experience. I do not automatically give a 4- or 5-star review, because the community of Amazon purchasers deserve to know real thoughts and experiences. So, my reviews are always and only based on my use and testing of the product. In that you can trust 100%. It's also important to note that I pay almost 30% in federal income taxes for each item that I receive, whether I review it or not.",

The quality is good. Its good fabric, very thin and flexible which makes it not so comfortable to wear. The color is nice. Good value for money",

Eljohn,Solid Versatile Pants With Some Water Resistance,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R358XXQKI0IH32/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK9J1J1Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2024",Color: 1-blackSize: X-Large,,"I recently received the ZAFUL Men's Parachute Sweatpants, and they met my expectations. The baggy fit adds a nice touch of style, making them perfect for a casual look.  The quality is decent; while they are quite thin, they do offer some water resistance, which is a plus. I really appreciate the neutral color, as it allows for versatile outfit combinations.  Overall, these sweatpants are a great addition to my wardrobe, providing both comfort and style for various occasions!",
M . . .,Nice fabric,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Z90KKV7TUL8B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK9J1J1Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 19, 2024",Color: 1-blackSize: XX-Large,,"These Y2k baggy track pants have a drawstring waist and wide legs, making them incredibly comfortable and easy to adjust. The streetwear style is right on trend. I like how versatile they are for different looks.  I recommend this product.",
KevinP656,Not bad for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL92PG0D5QAXD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK9J1J1Z,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Color: 1-blackSize: XX-Large,,"These are comfortable pants for any time of the year. They stay loose and keep air out. They are thin but don't hug your skin and have good wind proofing so they are warmer than jeans. This pair has a very wide leg opening at the bottom of each leg, If they weren't so big there I would have given a 5 star.",

The Arshad Family,Great Sweatpants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R347KV63H9RACX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK9J1J1Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 16, 2024",Color: 1-greySize: Small,,Fits true to size on the waist and length-wise. I like that the waist has the strings to tighten it. Pockets are deep enough to old cell phone and wallet comfortably. It's not too thick which means it can be worn in the summer time as well. I am grateful to have it in my closet and I think you would be as well!,
Al,"Comfortable, class and quality",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10EJY16QC2J47/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK9J1J1Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 15, 2024",Color: 1-navy BlueSize: X-Large,,"These pants are true to size, very comfortable and great for any type of workouts, as they ""give"" when and where you need it. They look really nice, as well, I like the adjustable draw strings, which allow me some latitude in what I am doing. The pants are definitely quality- the material, the stitching, style and fit. These are rather lightweight, so indoor workouts, or spring, summer and fall outside, are appropriate. The price point is excellent and i definitely recommend them.",

JDsmomma,They look just as advertised,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1M7PJALA8120E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK9J1J1Z,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 14, 2024",Color: 1-greenSize: Large,,"They look just as they do in the advertising photo. They are quite thin though and will provide absolutely no warmth at all. I don’t really think that they are worth 30$ - the price when I ordered them. They are well sewn- no loose threads or wobbly seems. The waist is elastic with a drawstring. Be aware that they have pleats at the knees- which is new to me, I’ve never owned pants that had these pleats before. I think they are probably about 10$ overpriced. They are ok, I don’t think that I would really recommend them but they are as advertised.",
Bee Travis,Nice quality pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OZOUHA4JXCHT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK9J1J1Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 6, 2024",Color: 1-greenSize: Small,,These pants are nice and chic. They are very stylish and fit well.,

hjh,There is nothing hiphop about these pants~!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16UM7LBRRTGKG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK9J1J1Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 3, 2024",Color: 1-blackSize: Medium,,"AS long as you know what size to wear and you know how to tie a drawstring you won't have to worry about bustin a sag in these pants. The are made of the classic polyester ""parachute"" type material but that makes them lightweight and very breathable. They are actually a nice looking pair of casual lounge pants. The pockets are deep and they are very comfortable. Don't go by what size Amazon thinks you need, look at the size chart in the bottom of the post. Im a size 3 and Amazon thinks I needed a 38 inch waist~sz LEventhough they aren't for me.........Nice pair of pants~!",
