Sizing seems good and the fabric is soft. Overall it's a great sweatshirt and seems well made except the zipper. The zipper feels very cheap and at the risk of not making sense, it is quite ""skinny"". We told our son to be careful and not pull on it too much because we're worried it will break. It does not glide well and sort of catches on itself . So far so good though and he loves the look, so that's great.",

I order an XL. It fits great with still plenty of room to move. The fabric is soft and very comfortable to wear. The stitching of the letters is nicely done and it looks great!  The zipper moves well up and down. And the hood is very big and comfy. I am super pleased with the sweatshirt.  Suggestion-- order way bigger than you want for a perfect fit! I don't like things tight and glad I didn't order my size-- or I would have had to return for a bigger size.  I am very pleased with the quality and comfort of the sweatshirt.,

Pros: • The embroidery is vibrant and adds a nice touch to the hoodie. • It’s oversized, making it super comfy and perfect for layering.  Cons: • The material feels a bit thin, so I’m not sure how warm it will be in colder weather. • The zipper gets stuck sometimes, which is a little frustrating.  It’s a solid hoodie overall, but a few improvements would make it perfect.",

It's oversized and seems true to size (I ordered an XL for my husband).  The zipper is good quality and slides up and down easily.

This style is “all the rage” with the teens right now. It’s a bit grunge but still a bit preppy. The letters have raw edges but clean seams. It’s not “wetsuit” material as one reviewer said… it’s just not a knit sweater and it’s not 100% cotton so it has a smooth feel. It’s not thick but it’s not thin. It’s about the same as a pair of joggers.  I ordered a small & it fits my son perfectly. He usually wears an adult small, so it’s accurate in sizing.",

However, look very close to the letters on the front in the pictures and you'll see just how badly they are formed.  The letters themselves are formed with all the edges frayed very badly, then sewn onto the hoodie in a narrow pattern to allow all the multitude of frayed strings to dangle.  It looks like a child made the letters and not a professional company.  I get that this is supposed to be some sort of ""trendy"" look, but that trend is supposed to create a well worn look.  This does not.  My high school son is going to wear this to school and see if he gets teased.",

I’m VERY glad that I did, because I wanted it to be over-sized, and it definitely is what I wanted! The sleeves are very long, the jacket is very roomy. It is warm and cozy, and the fabric is NOT like scuba fabric, it is just like any other soft sweatshirt. Soft on the outside, soft on the inside, where it has nice fleece. I had actually expected to find it to be of some stiff, uncomfortable, odd-looking fabric, just taking my chances, you know… However, I am soooo pleasantly surprised, I cannot say enough about this jacket! The letters are well-stitched, this jacket does NOT look cheap at all, and I very highly recommend it! The zipper is easy to use. It opens on the upper a lower end. It is not difficult at all to maneuver. The hood is nice and large, comfy. I don’t know what the other customers received, but what I received is perfect, honestly! I must say it again, though…. If you want it to be really over-sized, please go 2 or 3 sizes up from what you normally wear. You will be just as pleased as I am! For reference, I am 5’6” tall, 120 pounds, waist 28”. This jacket feels comfortable and goes all the way down to the top of my thighs. It does not look baggy at all, but looks intentionally oversized. I would give this jacket 10 stars, if I could.",
