Taryn,Not the best...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10R6EEXERFDR0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0945QKWM1,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black-16,Verified Purchase,They fit well and are very comfortable to wear. The pockets do not have male part snap buttons which is kinda weird so the pockets don't actually snap closed. The strap also broke off in one day but these are one of my first pants in this style and they fit alright. I'll cut the other black strap off since it's really frayed anyways to make it not look so odd and find a more expensive pair with better material quality in the future.,

The pants were a little on the large side (I am 5'8 160~ lbs) this isn't necessarily a bad thing just should be kept in mind. There are two patches on the left pant leg which are mostly nonsense (images attached) but these could be easily sewn over with new patches if wanted.

The material is like nurse scrubs rather than joggers. The pockets are very thin and also sewn horribly. Cannot even hold a phone.  I requested a refund from this seller and they were not willing to reimburse me. Instead, they sent two more pairs for free. The problem is, these additional pants were of equally low quality. Both broke at the zipper and one of them shrunk two sizes smaller after a single wash. One of them was very itchy and uncomfortable. The drawstring has no metal or rivets to protect the pants. If you pull on them too tight, they will rip the waistband. They are no longer wearable after only one month from arrival.  Overall, this was the worst purchase I've made so far. $30 spent and not a single pair of pants to show for it.",9

(amazon also had a little notice on the item saying “fits true to size, order your usual size” so that informed my choice, too) the fit is Great! they came out of the bag looking super small, but they actually just have an insane amount of stretch without being super tight. the waistband fit over my hips and waist easily, and even though my thighs definitely fill out the pants, i can still move freely. (someone with skinnier and shorter legs would probably be able to more easily achieve the baggy, oversized look— i end up kind of just having normal looking pants. but it’s not a problem, cause they’re nice!)  i had kind of hoped for them to be more on the sweatpants side of material, and these are a little bit closer to windbreaker material, but it’s not a huge deal. they’re still comfortable to wear, and the material isn’t too noisy as you walk and it rubs against itself.  the straps didn’t come assembled onto the pants, which i loved. i can attach and detach them as i please, which is a huge bonus. they’re long enough that i can have them cross over in the back for a more edgy style, or just leave them to one leg each instead. they are incredibly flimsy, though— i probably wouldn’t leave the straps attached when i put the pants through the wash. (that’s my common practice for any type of bondage pants, but i feel like it’s definitely worth noting that while some pants with straps can hold up to a wash, it doesn’t feel like these will survive it.)  im sort of tall, with most of my height in my legs, so with clothes that are manufactured in asian sizing, i sometimes have a problem with things being too short. while i feared for this, it didn’t end up being the case! i don’t end up with the stylish, purposeful bunching at the ankles, but the pants do go all the way to my ankles without me having to wear them uncomfortably low. they also don’t ride up over time, leaving me looking like im wearing waders every time i get out of the car. that’s a huge blessing.  my biggest issue is that the pockets are shaped strangely? something about the design makes things chronically fall out of them, especially when i bend over/sit down. they’re also somewhat small, which i didn’t expect since these seemed like they were marketed as men’s pants. i was hoping to take advantage of some oversized pockets, but that wasn’t the case. they do zip shut, though! so if im carrying something small i just have to remember to zip the pocket and i should be fine. the fact that i barely ever remember to do that is entirely my fault.  overall, these were definitely worth the money! they’re a bit less expensive than the other options out there, and for them to look like they’re supposed to and to fit like they’re supposed to? that’s awesome!",15
