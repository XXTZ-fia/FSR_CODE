Moon,Really nice quality!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R544EBU1569DT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNVJFWPN,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 29, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black1,Verified Purchase,I love this jacket!! The material is sturdy and it keeps the wind out 100 percent. It looks great!! I bought a XXL and it fits perfectly with a little bit of wiggle room! Overall this jacket is definitely worth the money and it’ll keep you warm in the winter! It also has a detachable hood which is really great since my warehouse job dose not allow hoods in the building.,
Jedi Pat,5 stars if it were waterproof,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JN850FG1X2E0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNVJFWPN,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Black1,Verified Purchase,"Obviously we like the look or we wouldn't order it. It's 25°f out and I have been warm walking in the cold with only a t-shirt under. The hood is a good size to stop wind if it isn't facing you. The material is nice and durable it seems. All in all a pretty good coat for winter, and I have their windbreaker with the compass on the sleeve for indoors or mild outdoor temperatures. Cool company with cool clothing!",

Nice quality, thick sturdy material, heavy quilted lining. Warm without being bulky. Lots of stylish details. It’s more of a winter coat, rather than a casual jacket for layering.  I ordered it in size S for my petite 5’-3” 100 lb daughter because XS was not available. The size S was HUGE on her! However, she loved that it was super baggy because that’s the look she was going for.",2

Joe Stevens,Toasty Techno Topcoat,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YDYCYD26H1EZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNVJFWPN,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 11, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black1,,"This big black winter parka looked very impressive once I got it out of the product bag. It’s very trendy, it’s very thick and it’s very warm – at least inside the house. The removable hood will cover your head completely and there is an ingenious cutout on the back of the coat that makes it perfect for riding a scooter. The seams and zippers were meant for tough use.  But all is not well with this techwear parka. The seller says it’s made of cotton or cotton blend material and it is not: it is 100% polyester. The outer shell of the parka is not even water-resistant, so wearing this in the rain and snow will only make you wet and cold. So, if you get this jacket, be sure to order a big can of waterproofing spray with it or you’ll be sorry. Another big flaw with this thing is that it has no inside pockets, which for a cold weather coat is pretty ridiculous. Better not keep any electronics in those large non-waterproof front pockets!  And this parka is not cheap. At this price point it should at least keep you warm AND dry when you’re outside in winter weather. Trendy, schmendy. If you want to stay comfortable in the snow and wet this winter, you’ll have to look elsewhere. It’s your money, spend it wisely.",3

HardwareSense,"Excellent jacket, love it.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HLIR30JX6RX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNVJFWPN,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 1, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Grey1,,"The NIepce street wear jacket is a very good and high quality product that I was really surprised to see from the company. Prior to getting this jacket I was not familiar with the brand and products, but I am so happy that I gave it a try, the design and execution are close to perfect. As soon as you take it out of the package, you will immediately notice the quality and craftsmanship applied here, the zippers are very good and high quality, granted they are not Ideal or YKK made, but they are good and they are including pull strings on every zipper end for better grip and convenience. The size I ordered was L and for my body type, I am 5.10'' and about 185Lbs, the jacket is slightly on the larger size, but that is kind of the point with the modern fit, it needs to be a bit loose to a line with the modern day fashion. This jacket can be worn during the colder winter months, just keep in mind that it is not super insulated so extreme cold temperatures would be an issue, but for normal above freezing temperatures, it will be perfectly fine. The design is the biggest selling point here, the jacket is unique with a lot of added elements that you don't see every day, all the side, back and front straps, the added patches, and that unusual cut on the lower back side are something special and ties the design nicely, that is my favorite part, it is just looking unique, well and obviously very comfortable too. The jacket features a removable hood as well, which I personally prefer and in addition to the two outside, zip up pockets, there are two large front pockets as well. When it comes to insulation, Niepce are using premium heavy duty polyester material on the outer shell of the jacket infused with cotton blend material inside the jacket for warmth, creating both breathable and thermal. I think the only major negative, for most people, would be the price of the jacket, I think at the asking retail price of $70-80 you will probably be better waiting for deep holiday discounts, and the second minor negative is not using any top level zipper brands like YKK and Ideal, but regardless I think for the style and fashion the asking price is not all that bad. Overall, a great jacket by Niepce, with a lot of modern day features, it is comfortable, stylish and will keep you warm.",

It is very heavy and very warm, and feels almost like a military/police type of parka, except for the eccentric Japanese-style detailing. Notably the big square cut out in the butt, but also some kanji and other nice details, and lots of toggles and other hardware. It fits super great and in line with projected sizing. The only real complaint I would have is that the zipper is a double zipper with two pulls instead of a base, and I got it misaligned and nearly broke it on the very first pull, so not sure how strong it is compared to the rest of the garment. It's a very heavy zipper but still. Great jacket tho!",
Wheel,"Surprisingly practical and comfortable--- size runs big, recommend going down one.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P2HBTCMOJUER/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNVJFWPN,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 7, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black1,,"This is an intentionally oversized and baggy fitting garment, so you can probably get away with ordering a size down from your usual. (The ""medium"" fits me like a US Large, so I definitely could have gone with a small-- but this gives plenty of room to layer over an outfit, or just lean into the baggy streetwear style.)  The quality is high, and the value seems to be there--- the price-point (around $99 at time of review) seems reasonable for what you get.  The patches are removable (velcro) and there's plenty of pocket space (cargo and utility), and the hood is spacious and comfortable. Very satisfied.",

We got this for our daughter - no review from her yet, so we'll update if she has feedback. I like the quality of the stitching, the heavy quilted lining, the long sleeves and the hood. The hood is removable, and there's a functional neck strap to hold the collar up when you're sans hood. The other straps are mostly for the aesthetic appeal, but they don't seem like they'd get in the way of real world usage. The kanji patch on the front is velcro attached, so you can swith it out with other velcro backed patches for variety. Overall, this seems to be a high quality jacket that should be stylish enough for the the kiddo, and warm enough to satisfy the parentals.",

These 2 fabrics are of high quality and they will ensure a very warm and comfortable, soft & breathable coat for winter. The look of the outside of the jacket is definitely Japanese Techno and the kanji design on the front of the jacket means “movement”. This jacket has drop down straps all the way around the jacket so it can take on a kind of techno/tactical vibe. This jacket has 2 large pockets on the front and it is a full front zipper closure. This is a well made, really cool version of Japanese techno culture and my son loves it. I ordered his size per the size guide that was provided and it seems it is supposed to be an oversized jacket and that is how it fit my son. I would highly recommend to others.",

This jacket manages to have the exact feel of those looks, and really looks quite cool. Do note the mask is not included haha, it really draws the eye in pictures, but make sure you're looking at and judging by the jacket alone. It's pretty well made, quite thick and sturdy. It's extremely warm, you get overheated immediately in summer, so I feel like this will be quite warm in winter. It feels dense, I guess is the right word. The hood is attached with a zipper so you can take it off when not needed, and is a good stiffy build that sits on your head stylishly without flopping down like some hoods. The patch with kanji is attached with velcro so you can easily take it off and swap it with something else. The zipper in front can go both up or down. With a lot of extra straps, it's a more complicated, stylish jacket. As long as it fits your style, and you wear it in colder weather, this could become a favorite jacket easily. It's more than just fashion, quite likeable if you like the Japanese aesthetic. Just note it's quite warm, so you'll probably overheat indoors. But if you're outside in winter, that will be a good thing.",
