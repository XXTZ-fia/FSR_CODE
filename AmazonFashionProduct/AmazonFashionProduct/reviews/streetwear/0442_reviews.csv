For reference, she is 5', 105lbs-ish, and wears a size 14 Girls from a Big Box store. These pants fit her great!  The material is very soft and breathable. The overall garment quality is solid, with secure stitching and straight seams. The elastic waistband makes them very comfortable. Plus, the checkerboard print and wide leg make them very fashion forward.  In this picture, my daughter just came in from playing outside all day when it is very windy... so she looks a little worse for wear in her sweatshirt and crazy hair. But when we have gone out in the past she has worn them with a white tshirt tucked in and her favorite tennis shoes-- and she got lots of compliments on them!  While I do think they could be priced a little more competitively, we do love these pants!!!",

I usually wear a size XL or XXL and pants. I ordered these pants in XL and they fit me just fine. According to the tag, the pants are 93% polyester and 7% spandex. They feel very comfortable and they’re pretty stretchy. The pants are a bit see-through, so you may want to wear seamless nude underwear or an oversized top to cover your caboose.",

However, I cannot rate these 5 stars because I just can't stand that the stitching ruins the pattern (pictured). I wish the pattern would have been lined up at the seams- then these would be 5 stars!",2
