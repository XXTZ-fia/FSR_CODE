Everyone has different fashion tastes.  Material. 5. It’s not too thin and it’s not winter heavy. It’s thick enough to stop a cold breeze and light enough to wear in summer. There is a slight stretch to the material. I'm really impressed with the quality.  Cut and fit. 5. The waist is a true small size. The fit is loose and on someone that is thin, it might be baggy. There is enough seat room to accommodate a larger behind. They are a nice, comfortable pair of pants.  Workmanship. 3. The seams and sewing are good. The design elements are not so good. All of the elastic drawstrings were tied together with ugly knots. The two pocket drawstrings are nonfunctioning and useless. The ankle hem has both wide elastic and the drawstrings, making it difficult to adjust them, plus they are so long I’d be afraid of tripping on them. Luckily, all those problems can be fixed simply by cutting and removing those drawstrings.  Overall, the pants are a good buy, especially if you enjoy casual clothes that are as comfortable as sweats but more upscale. They wash well, also.",3

However, I really appreciated the color and how it doesn't make the typical 'squish squish' noise that pants of this type usually make. They were noisy but definitely not as noisy as other pants sound when you walk.  Also, if you have long legs amd have tramatic experiences with flooding in grade school, these may not be for you. I really wish that these came in a tall version.",

The only down side is the ankles are huge and even if you cinch them in they are still huge with a long draw string. I wish they would make them a little small with a smaller drawstring so us short people aren’t tripping over such a long draw string you can tuck the up in the pants but it does fall back out with long wear. Other than that definitely a great buy!",3
