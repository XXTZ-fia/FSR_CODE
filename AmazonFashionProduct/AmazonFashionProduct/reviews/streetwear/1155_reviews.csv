Angel,Love them,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OM9S4KXJVWO7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCYQ82SY,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 8, 2024",Color: Style1Size: Medium,,These pants are perfect. They fit my son amazingly well. They have an elastic waist band so it’s stretchy and not restricting like Normal jeans. He loves how baggy looking they are while remaining comfortable. We would absolutely recommend these,2
Anna Hunter,Waaaay too short and small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FINP2PKH26Z5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCYQ82SY,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 29, 2024",Color: Style1Size: Medium,,"YAY🎉 FOR 5'7"" and SHORTER! NOT FOR THE TALL!  ORDER 2-3 SIZES UP (but be careful that the waist isn't too wide when doing so😮‍💨).  ❌️Ordered these for a 6'2"" man, typical 34-34, 165lbs, slim athletic build.  😅Ended up giving them to a tween girl, 5'6"" @ 135lbs. Fits as advertised when she wears them.",
