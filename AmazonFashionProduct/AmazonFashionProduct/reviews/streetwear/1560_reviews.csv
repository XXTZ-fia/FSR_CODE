Kaleb,Great fun pants!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WZRJ8CGM4VEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKDZLVWJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 14, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Orange,Verified Purchase,These are fun and versatile.

LUser09,It's pretty nice.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BN9JA45SH09P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKDZLVWJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 5, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,"The material and look seem bad at first, but then I realized that these are indeed high waisted pants. They may appear too long, but luckily the tie at the end is perfectly capable of making it fit how you want! The material is parachute, but it's not as loud as like those plastic parachute pants. The material is also very breathable.",

Nico,Soft,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWN1EKG1H0T5P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKDZLVWJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 14, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Blue,,"I got these women's cargo pants that have truly exceeded my expectations in both style and comfort. The unique design of these pants, with one half in red and the other in blue, immediately caught my eye. It's a bold yet tasteful choice that adds a touch of vibrancy to my wardrobe, breaking away from the conventional monotony of solid colors.  One of the standout features of these cargo pants is the softness of the fabric. From the moment I put them on, I could feel the luxurious softness against my skin. The material not only enhances the overall comfort but also adds a premium feel to the pants, making them suitable for various occasions, whether it's a casual day out or a more relaxed workplace setting.  The fit of these cargo pants is impeccable. They strike a perfect balance between being tailored and comfortably loose, giving me the coveted baggy look without sacrificing style. The design flatters the figure while allowing for ease of movement, making them versatile for different activities and environments.  The combination of the unique color scheme, soft texture, and well-balanced fit makes these cargo pants a standout addition to my wardrobe. They are not just a fashion statement but also a practical choice for those who appreciate both style and comfort in their clothing. I would highly recommend these pants to anyone looking to elevate their casual wardrobe with a touch of boldness and a lot of comfort.",3

Tbirdg89,"Great dual color parachute pants...looks great, fits great, comfortable material",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UC18ZWTOTAC3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKDZLVWJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Blue,,"After losing 169 lbs so far, after having weight-loss surgery 11 months ago, I've been looking at different styles of pants to try that I've never worn before. I love these dual color parachute pants...these are very similar to some popular styles back in the 90s.  These parachute pants are made from a very nice material...not much stretch in the material, but it is cut large enough to accommodate the loose excess skin I have in my lower abdomen and thigh areas. The fit is very comfortable, though it may look tight in the front (I have an apron of loose skin there, which most people don't have, so it will be much looser on an average sized person). I love all the different pockets, especially since sometimes you're lucky to get just 2 pockets in pants these days.  I would definitely recommend these parachute pants to anyone. I love the dual colors of these parachute pants, the material is comfortable, the fit is great, and I really love the cargo style pockets.",12
Jenn,"super baggy, don't go a size up",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BLXVFGWRL3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKDZLVWJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 28, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Blue,,"Got it and it looks pretty much like the photo. I got it in small and it fits just like the picture. So, if you thought you'd have to order a size up to achieve this look, you don't at all. Get your regular size so the waist area is about right and the poofy legs will fit like it shows in the photo. The purply side in real life is a ruddier purple than I'd hoped, so I was slightly disappointed, but it might not matter to you. Very lightweight, feels like a wind breaker but slightly crunchier.",3
Jill-Elizabeth (Jill Franclemont),Super cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35CPABREFMLN5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKDZLVWJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 4, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Blue,,"Women Cargo Pants Patchwork Y2K Streetwear Baggy Drawstring Elastic Parachute Pants  Our 24 year old daughter loves herself some baggy pants, and these were such a cute and fun find!
