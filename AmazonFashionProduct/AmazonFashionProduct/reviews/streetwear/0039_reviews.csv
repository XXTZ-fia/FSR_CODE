I'm short so I'll have to hem the legs a bit but that's not uncommon for me. I'm able to comfortably do splits and squats in them, fabric is very nice with its level of stretch. Thick enough to be comfy in the upcoming winter but not so thick they're uncomfortable in the dog days of summer. I wear a 32 and I used the chart to get my size and they're a perfect fit. I look forward to wearing these for a long while!",4

I replaced my old work pants with these and i love them! I did make some adjustments to them, though. I added a belt loop so i could hang my keys, and i cut the straps on each leg and stitched them to the pockets so they were a bit more functional. But, i enjoy doing little alterations and customizations to my clothes like that. It was very simple adjustments and well worth it! They fit great. I got a pair in small and they are comfy; but i prefer a more loose fit so i also got a pair in medium. Very happy so far!",2
