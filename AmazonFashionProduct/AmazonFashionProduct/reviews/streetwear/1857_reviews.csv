Frank Federico,Definitely not worth the $25 shipping charge,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EOZFRC62K434/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D62WZ7SW,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 20, 2024","Size: LargeColor: 05-black,grey,coffee,apricot+black",Verified Purchase,I ordered this and I thought since the price was low at $25 charge for shipping was reasonable. It was only until after I ordered that I found out it was two weeks then extended to 3 weeks. I was much better off buying from another brand at a higher price with the free fast shipping. When the product was received it was okay nothing special about the shirts but nothing particularly bad,

The pack included an apricot and army green colored shirt. He typically wears Extra Large T-shirts, so based on the description and reviews, we ordered the 2XLs. I am glad we did this as they fit like XLs with just a tad more bagginess.  The shirts are 100% cotton, so most likely these will be used for sleeping in. Each of the colors has remained looking like new even after being washed and dried. You can probably buy 2 of these 2-packs for the same price as only 1 2-pack of the famous national brand. This is a great value and the quality is very high as well.  Workout T Shirts for Men Oversized Gym Loose Fit Tshirt Heavy Cotton Washed Vintage Faded Sleeping Tee Unisex Tops",3
RedWingDad,Great set of shirts,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EAQ071YLP9N1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D62WZ7SW,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 21, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: 02-apricot+army Green,,"The t-shirts are crafted from soft, high-quality cotton, offering a comfortable fit with a simple, clean design and no unnecessary graphics. The colors are my favorite, although availability was an issue on other colors. While they look good and feel comfortable, the $25 price tag seems high for basic shirts. I'm unsure how they will perform after washing, particularly regarding shrinkage and wrinkles, as I have yet to launder them. I plan to update this review after a few months to assess their durability and how well they hold up over time. If I had to guess, I'm sure they will last several months, although that's just an opinion and only time will tell. Aside from that, I would recommend these shirts to anyone.",

These are nice and heavy cotton, no lightweight fabric here.  As such, I wouldn't really wear these in the summer.  More for cooler days in the spring and fall.  The only way I would have liked these better is if they didn't have any tags along the back collar.",
