They appear much baggier in the pics, but I'm sure that depends on height and stuff too. She's 5'7 and they are still baggy enough. They've washed up well and haven't faded. We wash all of our dark stuff together. They're comfortable and look great on her. Nice quality for sure!",

Great price for a pair of durable baggy pants.",
