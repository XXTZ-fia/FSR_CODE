Stryder,Love this Hoodie,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1L968HM3X1JLL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C23LB581,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 23, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black1,,"I would like to start by saying that I love the style of this hoodie. It's baggy without being overly big. The baggyness is mostly in the width and not length, meaning it doesn't extend far past my waistline. It could maybe use with a bit larger hood, but that's just personal preference.  It will definitely keep you warm. The front mouth cover portion can be completely removed if you prefer and you can also tuck it inside of the hood to have it sit closer to your face if the wind is still getting in and it's too much for you.  My only complaint really is that the pockets are too small. I like that they have zippers on them, but it would be nice if the pockets were much larger or even more like a traditional hoodie where the pocket goes through to the other side so your hands can touch inside.  All in all, I love it and it suits my personal style and tastes very well.",2
Remiyyah,Militant vibes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PKNMG7YFOWCV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C23LB581,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 23, 2023",,,"This combined hoodie/vest is moderately heavyweight. Although the color is fully black, you can see the different design concepts combine to make a viable fashion piece.",
Mad Max,"Love the styling. Runs small. Very hot, not breathable",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U7TNO03GVBWX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C23LB581,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 5, 2023",,,"Sizing:  I got a medium for a teen girl, 5'6"" tall, size 0. It's a perfect fit. Fits pretty much exactly like the photo. Length is great, sleeve length is perfect.  So my guess is, on a medium sized man this would run small.  Styling:  We all like the styling. I wasn't sure whether it was going to look like a costume, or look too gansta. It's hard to tell since the model in the photos has a bunch of accessories (mask, etc).  When just wearing as a sweatshirt with jeans or black pants, it doesn't look outrageous at all. It just looks like a normal black sweatshirt with a stylish vest/hood.  The vest is sewn onto the sweatshirt, you could remove it with a seam ripper if you wanted to use the vest for other clothing.  Fabric:  The vest is made of nylon, like tent material.  The sweater is a fairly low quality polyester. It's normal sweatshirt material, and it's fairly thick. But it's not brushed or particularly soft.  Also, none of it breathes - it gets very hot very fast.  So you have to plan ahead a bit when and where you're going to wear this, because it's kindof cumbersome to get on and off. It's not easy to layer with this.",3
