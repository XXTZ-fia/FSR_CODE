Only thing I didn’t like is how easy the snaps can come off and you have to keep snapping it back together but I received so many compliments on these jeans,

LovelyAlexandria09,Aesthetically pleasing but…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KMZNZS291GZV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4KJM546,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 29, 2024",Color: BlueSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"These aren’t functional at all for daily use. Read the reviews. Unfortunately, if you intend to wear as pants, they do not stay snapped. The pants come in 5 parts (one pair of shorrs, two pants legs and two pockets). I think the snaps need to be more heavy duty. Like even the pockets pop off with ease. Returning.",

Mel Monroe,I love them !,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZKMOFQC2YR46/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4KJM546,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 7, 2024",Color: BlueSize: Large,Verified Purchase,I went by the reviews. I don’t recommend ordering a size down if you have hips and stuff . The material is stretchy. It looks like the picture. The only problem was the buttons would come undone if I sat down or something but then again it was probably because they were snug.The quality is great though.,19
