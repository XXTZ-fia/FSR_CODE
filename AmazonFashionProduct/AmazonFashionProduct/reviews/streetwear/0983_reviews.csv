Frances Perez,"Very thick, great quality print",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVEAOROWDVP1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D263JLLJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 17, 2024",Size: MediumColor: A1 White,,"This shirt is really thick and long. It's the perfect pump cover for me when I go to the gym. I am 5'0, 120lb and it goes down to right above my ankles. The design is pretty very modern, vibrant, and not pixelated. The quality of the print seems to be very good and will most likely last me a long time!",
Rick Mills,Oversize soft cotton shirt makes a nice nightshirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BJFRBGBIVSE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D263JLLJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 5, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: A1 Black,,"This is a 100% cotton T-shirt having (apparently) a theme of looking back on winter and celebrating the month of March. It has an illustration of a girl holding a shoulder bag and looking back over her shoulder. The large Japanese script at top translates to ""I like it"". The English script says ""old memory of new time"" and ""mont-March"". The script appears to be silk-screened, and the image appears to be an appliqué. The back side is blank.  I ordered a size XL after consulting the sizing chart. I am 5'11"", 195 lbs, with a 44"" chest. The fit was as expected, a little loose without being baggy. The hem of the shirt comes to crotch level, so it is a good 6"" longer than a standard T-shirt.  I obtained this as it was shown as an ""oversize"" shirt, and I am always looking for loose, longer T-shirts which I can wear around the house as a nightshirt, and sleep in in cooler weather. I like nightshirts which are long and come to the crotch or below, and this one fits well. The material is soft and I am sure will be comfortable for sleeping.  I would have liked it even a bit longer, and the sleeves seem a bit short as well. The catalog photos show the sleeves extending past the elbow, but mine definitely do not. All in all, this is going to be a comfortable nightshirt for me, as well as wearing outside on our deck.  Please note I have adjusted the contrast in the photo to better show where the hem comes against my black shorts.",3

Jenna,Small is still so huge,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38NVD9997T3Z3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D263JLLJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 16, 2024",Size: SmallColor: A1 White,,"This is a nice shirt. The print seems to be done well and it seems like it will last a long time before peeling/flaking. The shirt itself is thick and does well to obscure bras underneath, although a bright colored one will show a bit. I'm 5'6"" and ~120lbs so I ordered the small. It's so huge on me. The shoulders are kind of ridiculous looking on me - it looks like I'm wearing shoulder pads. I knew it would be big because it's labeled as oversized but it's beyond oversized. I'll need to chop and resew this shirt to make it more wearable. Still cute though.",

The quality of the shirt is thick and has a cool oversized shape. The artwork looks well printed/screened on and fills up most of the front side down to the bottom of the shirt. There's also a graphic on the lower back of the shirt. Check out this low price high quality material shirt if you want to be stylish!,
KingTy,Cute Anime Design and Comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIPS72O5BV2RA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D263JLLJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 4, 2024",Size: MediumColor: B1 Pink,,"The Graphic Tees is a very cute anime design t-shirt.  The fit is oversized which gives it more room for breathability and comfort in fit.  The t-shirt design isn't of a specific anime character but rather a random design that fits the look.  The t-shirt is made from cotton, and arrived very well packaged in a sleeve pouch.  The shirt is unisex for anyone to wear as long as you get the correct size it will satisfy you.",

This shirt is NOT shaped the same way. The upper sides under your arms are fitted tighter. The shirt still fits well, giving a 'slimmer' look than your basic graphic Tee. Perfect shape for going out on a grocery run or hanging out with friends, but I'll stick with a basic, baggy Tee for work or playing sports. I wouldn't call the shape ""restrictive"", but I'm definitely aware that its there.  Big fan of the shirt, would definitely buy more with other prints in the future!",
