I had previously picked up another shirt from Coofandy that I really liked. So when given the chance to try out this one, I had no problems giving it a whirl, and it has met my expectations.  While it is polyester, the fabric looks and feels more like a linen shirt. It fits fantastically, even for someone with wide shoulders like I have. I am not thin but I also don't have much of a gut. But I imagine even if you have a bit of a gut, this shirt will still fit very comfortably.  It is a great look for being on the beach in shorts or at the clubhouse in pants. I really like the color too as it is not too flashy but gives just enough color as to be noticed. And the material also feels very durable. Having washed and worn it a couple of times now, I'm happy to report that it is still looking as good as day one.  If you're looking for a great looking, comfortable, versatile button-down shirt, this is a great option. And for the price, it's better than what you'll get at many stores. Highly recommend!",2
