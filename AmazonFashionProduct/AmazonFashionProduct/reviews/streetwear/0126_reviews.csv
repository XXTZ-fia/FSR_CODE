These pants were it. However, There was a massive 3"" gap on my low back because of the waistband. I wish I got pictures. Sorry! I put on the tie-belt it came with but it made it look scrunched and horrible. I had to cover it with shirt I wore. They were comfortable - didn't make me hot, not much elasticity, but versatile.  I would buy 4 pairs of these if they fix that waist band! I hope this helps you!",3
