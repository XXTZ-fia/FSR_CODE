The pics show that has layers with a sheer top layer... definitely just one layer of cloth no sheer topping and the ruffles are solid too. It runs small, I'm usually a medium (5'7"", 165lbs) and I ordered a XL... which fits perfect. I'm probably going to alter it. The straps sit a little funny. Probably better suited as a strapless dress imo.",
