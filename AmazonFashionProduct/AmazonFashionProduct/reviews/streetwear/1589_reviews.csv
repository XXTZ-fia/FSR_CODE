They are comfortable and can be easily slipped on. There are pockets on the sides of the legs (cargo pants style) and bungee cords on the pant bottom--in case you want to close the gap where your shoes meet the pants, while hiking or camping. They are bit long for me, so make sure you take your measurements closely. There are 2 small straps located on the side pockets that simply dangle on the legs. I'm not sure of their function. They have a button, but there is no receiving end for the button. I'm not sure if they're purely design or what. It  is drawstring,  so that adds to the comfort. They are great value and perfect to wear around the house.",

A bit warm because the fabric hugs the skin and the inseam is a tad stiff.  I can’t see myself doing the splits or squating in them or the thin crotch is sure to tear. Velcro pockets on the legs and one Velcro pocket on the right butt cheek. Waist pockets feel a bit thin and might tear if you put sharp objects in there. Overall it’s tolerable for every day leisure use but definitely not for vigorous activity.,
