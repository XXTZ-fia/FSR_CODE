AmazonReviewer,Runs small but great shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LW93C8PNMXSE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQN88QJG,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 17, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Light Grey,,Love the lace details and hemlines on this long sleeve shirt. It’s super stretchy and soft. It’s more of a juniors sizing as opposed to women’s. I got a size large and it’s still a bit too small to wear out but I’ll use it for around the house. Wish they came in XL because I’d definitely order another in a size up. For reference I’m 5’4” and 145lbs and usually a medium in shirts.,
