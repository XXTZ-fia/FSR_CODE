Im using them for a Halloween costume and was happy with the quality for sure. Be mindful of the fit. I'm typically a 34x34 men's fit for jeans and work cargos... The large here say 32.7-42? But they are snug (not tight) on me completely untied. Length is bang on. If you are a 34x34 or 32x34 these are probably perfect as a Large,
