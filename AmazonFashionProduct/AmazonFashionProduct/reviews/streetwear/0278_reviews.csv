Kelly R.R. Ellis,"Cute top, fits true to size, fabric isn’t great though",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3T1YZBHI8SUGW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9K4NLKL,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2024",Color: PinkSize: X-Large,,"This top is a fun throwback to Y2K and I love the design and the light pink color. It’s not oversized at all, other than the sleeves being a little long. BUT the fabric is NOT cotton at all, it’s a shiny, slippery feeling material which looks pretty cheap. It’s also pretty thin. I won’t be keeping it.",

Naeem,"Thin Material, Cool Design",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H9ASS7N179ID/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9K4NLKL,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 13, 2024",Color: PinkSize: Medium,,"I got it because it has a cool, grungy design on it and because pale pink and black are good together. Alas, the material greatly disappoints. The product details say it's 100% polyester, while the description says 95% cotton and 5% spandex. It's definitely polyester and not cotton. It's that thin, sort of see-through, shiny fabric with the design basically printed on the front. If you don't mind the fabric, then it's a nice shirt. It fits true to size and it's a very cute long-sleeve.",
Shar Taylor,"Not as expected, but…",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8PSCUX09L90Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9K4NLKL,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 11, 2024",Color: PinkSize: Large,,"I like the graphic design, but the fabric is not as expected. I don’t like the feel and look of the fabric. The pictures of this blouse on the model in my opinion shows a more soft looking fabric. This is more of  a ribbed knit jersey fabric. I don’t think it looks flattering on me. For fit I went with my normal size in clothing. It fits as expected. There’s a lot of stretch. Overall it’s not for me.",
K. Avalos,Really cheap quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU3VAU5RNKIFD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9K4NLKL,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 11, 2024",Color: PinkSize: Large,,"Feels like garbage to wear, and to touch. Do not reccomend",

I plan to wear it with my goth black pants and rider jacket. The material is polyester, which is soft, stretchy, and comfortable. The ribbed knit adds a nice texture to the shirt. I was concerned about the size seeing other's post, but for me, the shirt fits like how it is advertised. I am a US size 2, 5'3"" — see my photo for size reference!",
V review,Love this shirt!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SBPFY02ITUWX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9K4NLKL,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 2, 2024",Color: PinkSize: Small,,"This shirt is great if you love the Y2K, streetwear, or grunge aesthetic. It's comfortable, the quality is nice, it's very breathable, and it's a cute shirt! I love this and would highly recommend it!",
CJM,Cute and Trendy.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QAL0IEUB1N3O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9K4NLKL,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 1, 2024",Color: PinkSize: Small,,"I recently picked up this long-sleeved graphic T-shirt from Y2K, and it’s just as cute as I hoped it would be. The design filled me with nostalgia for what I wore in the late 90's/early 00s. They’ve nailed the look again with this piece. While I love almost everything about this shirt, I do wish the material was a bit more breathable. But that's more of a personal opinion based on the climate where I live. Overall, I’m really happy with this shirt. It’s versatile, stylish, and I’m confident it’ll hold up just like all my other Y2K pieces, which have gotten a lot of wear. This tee is definitely worth adding to your collection!",
HappyPizza1,Stock photos are misleading!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V95PVK7832EU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9K4NLKL,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 30, 2024",Color: PinkSize: Small,,"The stock photos show a narrow hourglass shape to this shirt. Additionally they show long sleeves that come to the middle of the model’s hand! All are misleading! The shirt is shorter than it is on the model, square-cut, very polyester-y, and the sleeves rest at my wrist bone! Other than that, the shirt seems to be well-made and is cute enough for casual wear!",
