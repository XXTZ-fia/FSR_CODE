I mean, a good quality, thick sweatshirt costs at least $80 these days. I recently bought one on clearance (50% off) for $55. You get what you pay for. I'm a seamstress and designer and here's my take on this sweatshirt.  It's not thick jersey. It's medium weight at best.  It has an oversized circumference around the body and the sleeves so it fits nice and loose but not super baggy. The length runs short for an 'oversized' fit and I doubt going up a size will help in that department. If you're looking for a long body/sleeves, look for a different hoodie. If you're good with a standard length with an oversized fit, get the size you'd normally wear instead of sizing up. This would fit petite sizes pretty well (under 5'5"").  The right side of the fabric looks great with a really nice distressed look that doesn't look too manufactured. The inside of the fabric is rough to the touch.  The stitching at the seams looks good, but at certain stress points (the kangaroo pocket), a high end garment would have a stabilizer backing to prevent the fabric from ripping at these points. This doesn't have that.  The hood is lined and is big enough that it comes up and over enough to protect your hair/face on a rainy day.  The neck hole is a decent size for pulling over your head.  It looks nice. It has an authentic vintage vibe for not a lot of money. I wouldn't put it in the dryer and I'd avoid washing it with heavy items like denim. I always wash my denim separately from my other clothes anyways. But I'd definitely lay it flat to dry and avoid the dryer. This will help it last longer. And ultimately, if you're looking for an authentic vintage vibe sweatshirt, a few rips and tears only adds to that look.  I like it and I'm keeping mine.",11

At 5'8” and 150, I normally order a large in sweatshirts, t-shirts, and similar casual clothing.  With this item, I ordered a medium, thinking that it should fit well because it is oversized.  It fit okay out of the package, but the oversized aspect seemed to be limited to the torso of the sweatshirt.  The sleeves were essentially normal.  I did not find the fabric to be particularly soft or warm, and the interior lining is untreated, not fleece or fleece-like as my other sweatshirts are.  Once washed and tumble dried, the sleeves shrank noticeably and the fabric was no softer than before.  The care instruction tag is apparently written in Chinese, but I assume it says “don't put this in the drier.”  At the end of the day, I did not find much to love about this sweatshirt.  It's wearable, but I wouldn't expect an invitingly soft or warm garment.  I'd also recommend ordering your normal size with this sweatshirt, notwithstanding the “oversized” description.",6

I'm about 6' tall and got the X-Large size shirt. It is longer than a normal sweatshirt for sure and definitely on the baggy side, though I might have preferred a little baggier (When in a cold environment, which is what I got this for, baggy means more air trapped, which means better insulation. At least, as far as I've noticed.) The material seems a little thinner than some of my other sweatshirts, so perhaps this one is intended more for style than for warmth? Again, I don't know much about sweatshirt fashion. Otherwise it seems to be a fine fit and well put-together other than an occasional loose thread. I do appreciate that the cuffs are decently snug though. I don't have to worry about my sleeves sliding down over my hands, which works great for keeping the hands free to do things without worrying about getting the shirt dirty or tangled. My getting this was a bit of an experiment for me. Overall this shirt is probably great for style purposes, but if you want it to keep out the cold you may need an extra layer beneath.  Thanks!",

It also has a side-to-side kangaroo-style front pocket which is wide enough for pretty much anything you might want to carry.

The hoodie features a ""washed"" appearance, particularly noticeable around the waist and wrist areas, as highlighted in the attached photos. I'm quite fond of this look. Although it's marketed as oversized, it's not excessively large, which I'm definitely happy about. It fits exactly as I anticipated for a size Large.

I typically wear an XL sweatshirt, but since the listing says oversized, I opted for a Large. And I'm really glad I did. For reference, I'm 5'7 and weigh about 190. I decided on Large since I'm losing weight, and figured even if it was a little snug, eventually it would fit. Well, even the Large is baggy on me. But I can't fault it because it does say oversized. The sleeves are baggy, but the waist is even baggier. At 5'7, the bottom hangs down crotch level, so it is long enough. As for the quality, the stitching looks good and the material is soft, and I like the vintage look. Overall happy with it so far. We will see how it holds up long term. Should any issues arise I'll come back and update this review. 5 stars because the listing seems accurate. But just be aware, it's definitely oversized.",
