I tried to like them, as the color is really or pretty, but I think I’m going to return them.",

Baggy, big, high-waisted jeans. The quality is actually really good. They are high quality, well-made levi jeans with a cute design. Aaaannd they fit just as our tweens desire: tiny waist, belly button just visible, and 7"" too long in the legs. They are fabulous and in-style. I feel too young to sound like  ""In my day, skinny jeans were in style....why so baggy?"" I suppose this is a cyclical problem. Better baggy and high-waisted than super toight, and refuse to come off! 'Tis the trend.",23
