Aubrea Kehoe,Hip dysphoria reducer (but has odd holes in the pockets),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HBGR3E61LAN8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08KXZV9RW,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 29, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Black&red,Verified Purchase,"So, I bought these sorta on impulse with the black friday deal, and they're pretty nice. They were two days late but yknow your shipping problems may vary. Two things I didn't expect about these pants: One, that they were going to be designed in such a way that slightly compresses the hips (if you're a man ordering these, you may feel that it's a bit tight in the groin area because of this, but if you're an afab nonbinary/transmasc person with hip dysphoria you might notice that it slightly compresses the hips. I find this gives the silhouette a more masculine appearance and I genuinely love that because I despise the look of my hips personally.) The waistband is sliiiightly snug? Not like too small snug, but like, you're gonna have to wear them and break them in a bit to stop noticing it if you're a bigger guy like I am. But there's enough stretch that it's fine, they just need to be worn. I find the ankle cuffs slightly too long, but I'm short, so I assume that won't be a problem for those taller than I am and I'm sure tall folks will appreciate that the ankle cuffs are longer (my brother, for example, often finds that pants with ankle cuffs are too short even if the pants fit him right everywhere else, so if you struggle with pants like that you'll appreciate the added length here).  But one weird thing I noted about the design that I didn't realize upon ordering, the while circles on the larger pockets are. Straight up just holes in the pocket. Pretty big ones too. Like I can sew over that and make it not a problem but I really feel like the pockets use some utility with holes like that, I wouldn't trust keeping my keys or other things in those pockets. And i know the design is meant to be more for show than function, but why not show AND function? Like cmon. If you really want pants of this style with usable pockets you might consider patching them from the inside or looking elsewhere. I do however kind of like the loose buckle clasp design? The provided loose lanyard-fabric-danglybit things whatever you call those don't really....have the friction nessecary to be put into the loose end of the provided buckles and do much of anything without slipping out? But that's fine, the dangling pieces are part of the design I'm sure (I'm gonna cut them off or paint over them I don't care for wearing branding I really wish they were like solid red or black), and the buckles having this free end gives me the option of putting a buckle end onto my keys so I can clip them to my pants. or you could get goofy with it and clip like keychains or idk a tomagotchi or something to them, you get 4 buckles and they're gonna just be sitting there you could make them a funky part of your pants.  But yeah just some rando details I thought some of yall might appreciate before buying the pants. Nothing works quite as you'd expect it to but the colors are nice, printing is clear, I'll definitely enjoy having these to wear to work and out and about.",9
