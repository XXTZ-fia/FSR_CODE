This is a review for the light brown sweater :o) Im 105lbs, 5’5”, and androgynous, for reference, and ordered a large. I would say the torso fits like a small—not that it isn’t baggy, but simply because it ends above my hips. And then the sleeves fit like a large. I threw it into the wash, but not the dryer, because Im nervous the torso will shrink even more!! I just let it air dry and it was still super soft. The design is pretty true to the photos besides some color variations. It’s not a super light sweater, but not heavy either. It’s one of those sweaters that you’d want to wear during late autumn/early spring when it’s breezy, but then you’d layer it when going out or wear it indoors during the winter. The material seems like it could unravel or get some holes if you’re constantly wearing it though.. So be weary of how often you wash it and what you plan to do in it. Otherwise, it’s pretty nice and cute. A great, warm, twee grandpa sweater :o)",

Good quality on the weave of the sweater, feels soft. Slightly oversized fit. The colors in the picture are NOT the same as the sweater we received. The cow is a dark blue and white.

The sweater we received is nice, but we would not have ordered it if we saw an accurate picture.",5
