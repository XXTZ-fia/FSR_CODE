SGT Liz,Poor sewing quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDRNCT1BACRZB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXJRDG9,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Light Grey,Verified Purchase,"My second time laundering the shirt and lost one button in the machine. Another was almost off and 2 others were frazzled. The sewing on the buttons are piss poor. The craftsmanship seems poor when looking at all the stitching. The material is thin and will need starching for wrinkles (probably my fault with it being 90% cotton.) At $30 dollars a pop, I am extremely disappointed.",
