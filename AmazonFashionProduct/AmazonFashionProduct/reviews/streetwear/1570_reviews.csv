Anna Hunter,MY NEW FAVORITE SHIRT!!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R999AI1ZI6YXH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2666742,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 10, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Pink,,This shirt is one of the best in quality that I've EVERRRRR purchased (I KID YOU NOT)!!!

Bushman,Nice oversized shirt!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVKVXU3WE0DNZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2666742,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 16, 2024",,,"I would say that I ordered a different color but I received the black one which I think is the default; so I would just say to be mindful of that. Because of the thickness of the material and the black color, I would not recommend wearing out during the summer. However, it is a cute oversized shirt that is easy to style with many outfits! The fabric is also not that scratchy and the design is simple enough to dress up and down with other accessories. Overall, this shirt is a 4/5 for its design!",
Kevin McKenzie,love it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VZJD777W23DB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2666742,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 9, 2024",,,I really love it and the quality is amazing,
Frances Perez,Super high quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HOXIUJO1OHGN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2666742,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 14, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Pink,,"I don't know where to start with this one. First of all, this shirt is very high quality in my opinion. The packaging, for one was very thoughtful and even the label has a nice quality to it. It also came with this unique fragrance packet which I really liked the smell of and appreciated, as most shirts I order from Amazon end up smelling like chemicals.  In terms of the graphic design, the print seems to be screen printed with good-quality ink. I don't expect this to be cracking anytime soon! The pink color is very true to the image. It's a soft, but vibrant pink hue. It is oversized so don't expect it to be tight or short. It's long enough on me that it covers my bum. The fabric is THICK. Don't expect a thin shirt. I was sweating in the Texas heat pretty quickly after putting this on and going outside. This shirt will keep you pretty warm, but would be nice for a cool spring or fall day. Overall, the attention to the small details is what sold me on this shirt.",
Sara Silva,My favorite tee,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34LWK15OG6TVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2666742,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 3, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Pink,,"I love the way that this T-shirt is cut and crafted a Scott kind of a bulbus design, which makes it look oversized without being sloppy. The color and print are incredible. I love this T-shirt. I wear it all the time!",

The oversized fit is comfortable and provides a relaxed, laid-back vibe that works well for both casual outings and lounging at home.

CARL,Shine Like a Star!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35TE9HGINUSZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2666742,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 9, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Pitch-black,,"I wear the Best Lucky Star shirt often. It looks great no matter what it is paired with and it always feels good, comfortably oversized and easy to move around in. So far, the shirt has washed and dried without any shrinkage. There is an added bonus. I don’t know if this is intentional - the shirt has a slight scent of incense that is imbedded in the star’s paint. It is a lovely scent that appears when I move. I hope it sticks around. I highly recommend this wonderful shirt.",2
Ashleigh,Good quality fabric a bit pricey,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QENXRB2E2Z9F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2666742,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 13, 2024",,,4.5  (standard rounding rules apply) sizing is accurate design is clear and accurate to pictures held up in the wash but priced slightly high for what it is would recommend,
One for All,love it!  might want to order up a size to get that oversize look FYI,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OZPFOL3F95EY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2666742,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 10, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Pink,,"Reviewed by spouse:  This definitely gives off Y2K vibes, but also maybe a little bit of magnolia pearl and or jaded gypsy vibes. It’s an oversize fit, but not lot, so if you want an oversize/slouchy fit definitely go up a size. I am wearing the large and for sizing reference, I’m 5’3, 135 and 34c and this is the look that I wanted to wear over a long fitted skirt.",3
Shannon Zolar,Great Tee,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2K00U9S1DF4JA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2666742,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 21, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Pink,,"I like the star design, the color is great too!
