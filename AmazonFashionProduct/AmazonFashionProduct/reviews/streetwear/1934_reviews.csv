Fit  like a standard pair of cargo pants not what’s pictured or what the size chart says. Really could have went with the 3X. But he said he’s going to keep them they’re just not the baggy look he was going for and what was pictured. I hope this helps someone 👍 other than the sizing being off they look to be a decent pair of pants, time will tell.",
