Montana,Actual good quality. not silky 💯,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Y81FDQI1QUHB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9JF5QLP,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 25, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: P1171-black,Verified Purchase,Came a day early for 1 that was nice. but also it's high quality the monkey is actually stitched into the pants and the screen shot logo is a  print but it's very well done no peeling. just make sure when you wash you wash them inside out to preserve the design. overall 10/10 better than most joggers and pants i've came across.,
