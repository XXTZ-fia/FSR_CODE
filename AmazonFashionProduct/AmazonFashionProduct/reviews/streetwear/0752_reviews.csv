The material feels stiff and uncomfortable almost plastic like, not what I was expecting at all. The fit is also really off—too tight in some areas and strangely loose in others, making them awkward to wear. I loved the look of the stripes, but unfortunately, the fit and feel just don’t work for me. Disappointed with this purchase",

I like these and think they’re cute. The quality is good for the price. They’re more a “silky” material than I expected, but not bad. I like that the drawstring is functional and the color is true to the photo. The front pockets are kind of awkwardly located, but it’s not a deal break for me. These will be great for summer and my beach vacation coming up!",4
