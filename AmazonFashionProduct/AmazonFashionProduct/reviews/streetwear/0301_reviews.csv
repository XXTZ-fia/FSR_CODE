Elkin Vargas cely,El color de la tela del saco es diferente a las terminaciones,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22KGQYFT2Q6SI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CD7XHW68,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,,"Se pidio en color negro pero las terminaciones son un negro mas fuerte que el resto de la tela y es muy notorio, poco fastifecho",2
Bisconaut,Meh,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGQ45GFPBUQYY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CD7XHW68,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 6, 2024",Size: 3X-LargeColor: Black+white,Verified Purchase,"Hoodies made from 100% polyester are rarely ""it"". This item tracks with that logic. To start the item runs small. I ordered a XXL and since the description says ""oversized* I thought it would be fine. I'm a larger sized man with a small belly and this jacket fits tight. Both in the arms and across the chest. The material is REALLY thin. So much so that you can see thru it when you hold it up to the light. It's polyester so it has that "" feel"" to it. You can tell that after a couple washes it's going to get those nubs all over it that polyester tends to get. The dragon decal isn't good quality. It seems like a cheap iron on and doesn't look like it'll last. In the end if you're going to buy it make sure you go big. It'll keep you warm I guess and for one or two wears it'll look ok.",
Pineapple Princess,Actually fits just right,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UWZ7IMQ9HI15/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CD7XHW68,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 6, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I got a small thinking it was gonna be oversized like it says but it actually fits just right, and the design looks pretty solid...though the only reason I'm rating four stars is because the zipper gets a little stuck when sipping it up",
