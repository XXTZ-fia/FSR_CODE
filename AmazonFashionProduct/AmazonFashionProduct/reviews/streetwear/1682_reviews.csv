Are you really sure that this is the kind of clothing you want to put on your unsuspecting teen?  Yes, as clothing this is a very warm pull-over hoody that fits very well and is made of soft but durable material. It would be better with a zip-up front. Without the lettering or with one of the other many designs without undeciphered Japanese characters, I would have no problem. My teen was cautious as well. He refused to wear the hoody.",

It's made well and I really like the quality feel, especially the hood which has the interior lined with the finished feel as the rest of the exterior.  Besides the hood, the rest of the interior is soft and fuzzy.  It is close to a ""perfect fit"" out of the box but the length in the back is a bit short and rides a bit high.  The sleeve lengths are great (and I have long arms.)  If you're 5'10"" or taller OR happen to have a long torso, I definitely recommend sizing up one size to account for the short length in the back.  If you're shorter than that mark then I would think you'd be able to order you're normal size.  I ordered a Medium but wish I'd gotten a Large.  I have no problem recommending this sweatshirt, just wish the back had about 2 extra inches of length.  I'm 5'10"", 160lbs.",
