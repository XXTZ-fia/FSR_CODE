At first I thought it was just a cheap ploy, but it's really on there! And the print is all right. It's not the traditional screen print where it sits in the fabric and feels like it's a part of the product. It's slapped on but it doesn't feel too bad. My kid loves it! It's his favorite pants and he goes to school in them and even though we have a code, they still allow these pants.
