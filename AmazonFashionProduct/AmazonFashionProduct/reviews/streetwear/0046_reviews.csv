B & N Francis,Great shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B5F1BKIQFMWB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D93DD254,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 16, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black Graphic,,"I dig this shirt, well, my daughter does. She's in her 'emo' phase (which come on, Emo hit it's peak back in the late 90s-early 00s. Whatever is on the radio now isn't emo... grr. anyways, rant over). The shirt is a thinner material but not see through (or else i wouldn't buy it) and has plenty of stretch to it. It's true to size with a SLIGHT feminine silhouette, but it's not fitted or anything. The shirt is meant to be a touch baggy. It looks like a men's shirt cut for a younger girl. The screenprint on the front is well done, doesn't feel plasticky or cheap or anything and nothing came off in the wash or dryer. Shrinkage is minimal, but i did wash on cool and dry on low, however the material is poly so it should be fine. Despite being poly, the material is super soft and my daughter said it's really comfy. This can be worn on it's own, with a scoop-neck undershirt, a tank, a long-sleeve undershirt (looks really good with black and white stripes in that respect), under a jean jacket or be playful and show a bra strap on the sloped shoulder (if you're an adult and not my daughter, that is... haha). Anyways, yeah... awesome shirt, awesome design, looks really rad.",5
CJM,Retro Vibes.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23XD21FCPAD5Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D93DD254,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 15, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black Graphic,,"I recently picked up this Y2K retro graphic off-shoulder T-shirt, and I have to say, it hits me in the feels lol. The retro vibes are perfect, and I've always loved the off-the-shoulder look. Y2K always nails my favorite aesthetic. This shirt is cute and grungy perfection. The fabric is lightweight and comfy to wear all day long. The fit is very relaxed, so if you're unsure, I would size down a touch. But overall, I love the look and this is going into my regular rotation. Definitely recommended!",2
