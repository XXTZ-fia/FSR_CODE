Didn't look or fit like that at all.  Also, like others have commented, the button hole was not cut out.  Weird.",

Now I have to break out my non sewing skills and fix it or wait weeks for another pair when I needed them for this week.,

June Welch,Wrong color,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUUDUM2BAF17J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DSPTZT9L,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 25, 2024",Color: 01-blueSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,They are good jeans overall but there is no hole for the button they fit well though they have lines at the top of them and they don’t have they white part by the knees they are not the right color they don’t look like the picture the material is good though I do have to cut a hole for the button though they are a little smaller than I thought they would be but overall are pretty comfy and they say they are mud waist but they are very high waist but they are good material,
MomsAwake,Sizing wayyyy off,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C3LEG88OVBWQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DSPTZT9L,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 21, 2024",Color: 04-greySize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"It’s silly to expect any differently these days, I suppose, but the 2xl wouldn’t zip over my US standard size 10 waistline. They were very roomie throughout as expected and super cute, but the waist was more like a standard US 6. Make it make sense- And being disabled and without a printer means I am not able to exchange most items that don’t work out for me so these pants will be donated to a women’s shelter. Which is totally fine. Just for the next person who may be considering these adorable pants….  If you are over an American standard 6/8, these aren’t the pants for you. And probably not any other fellow under 5’4 person.  We are better left to petite and accurate sizing 😂😂",
Squirrel Bucket,great pair of jeans!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I2SGNQKTVP59/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DSPTZT9L,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 19, 2024",Color: 01-blueSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"there are a few different pros and cons: they are very cute and i like them a lot. i will definitely get lots of use out of them. something i wasnt expecting was that there wasnt a hole to put the button thru, so i had to cut one myself. other than that they are great and i highly recommend!",
H. Brownlee,Way too tiny,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34BZX6F88IJOU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DSPTZT9L,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 17, 2024",Color: 01-blueSize: Large,Verified Purchase,I bought these in large for my teen daughter who wears a US size 12. They appear to be xtra small! I’m a 2/4 and they are even too small for me. Waste of money.,
