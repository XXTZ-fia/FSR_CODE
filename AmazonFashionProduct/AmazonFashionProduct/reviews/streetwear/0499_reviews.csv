I ordered a Medium, and while I expected they might be a bit long (which they were), I wasn't prepared for them to be too narrow around the hips and thighs.  FULL REVIEW: I don't have nearly enough cargo pants in my life, and I thought this pair would help flesh out my wardrobe a bit. The fabric is more comfortable than it would initially seem; it's the kind that wicks moisture away and keeps the weather out, yet it's soft against the skin. The color is nice and true-to-screen too.  I just wish this pair of pants fit me better. The excess length alone would have probably been manageable, but the fact that the thigh and hip area doesn't fit me is unfortunately a deal-breaker. I will be gifting these pants to someone with a taller and skinnier frame than mine.",
