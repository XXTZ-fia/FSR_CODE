2xist,Funky and Sized Right,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2U54WM1QOMY9B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9KNVCNH,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 28, 2024",Size: SmallColor: P11062-black,Verified Purchase,"Screenshot Clothing offers surprisingly fresh, casual, and comfortable styles with excellent sizing. As a petite guy (waist 28-29, H: 5’5”), I find their small size truly fits like a small—unlike the inflated sizing often seen in American brands today.  In a market where XS has virtually disappeared, and ‘small’ now resembles a medium, Screenshot stands out by providing accurate, well-proportioned sizes that fit comfortably without the baggy, oversized feel of today’s typical Small. Beyond their unique, funky style, this brand ensures clothing feels right and fits perfectly. A HUGE fan, I only desire that I could afford more of them.",

At first I thought it was just a cheap ploy, but it's really on there! And the print is all right. It's not the traditional screen print where it sits in the fabric and feels like it's a part of the product. It's slapped on but it doesn't feel too bad. My kid loves it! It's his favorite pants and he goes to school in them and even though we have a code, they still allow these pants. I'm sure as long as I don't buy the teddy bear skull (even though I really want to) he can wear these around where ever he goes. What a fun pair of casuals!",
