For smaller folks, they can sport this as the baggy pants fashion it is intended for.  Uses elastic bands as the belt, both side hip pockets, and by both ankles (increase/decrease baggy effect).  Main pockets are basic pockets, about 6-7 inches deep. Does not have the sense of items falling out of the main pockets, but the side hip pockets provide that extra sense of assurance from items falling or jumping out while active outdoors.  Material is smooth, doesn't feel cheap, and fairly flexible, but not stretchy. The pants feel durable, and has some resistance to water. At some point it began to absorb water, but if under light rain you'll at least have some protection. Due to its fabric, it doesn't allow much airflow into the pants, acting like an insulator.  Make sure you look at the size chart, EU based, to determine your waist size. Despite getting a 2XL, it is slightly tight. At the same time, there is no real need to use the elastic belt to further tighten.  Somewhat fashionable, yet simple for those who can pull the look. Otherwise they are a good outdoor pants with extra pockets. Still a good recommendation for what it offers.",13
