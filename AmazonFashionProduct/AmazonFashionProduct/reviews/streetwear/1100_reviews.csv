It was an electric blue not at all like the color in the picture and the material isn't even remotely similar to the picture. It fit very weirdly because above the waist it was loose around the armpits and on the sides and then tighter around waist. Such a strange fitting never worm anything like it.  and the neckline was above my collarbones it was just so ugly and unflattering.,
