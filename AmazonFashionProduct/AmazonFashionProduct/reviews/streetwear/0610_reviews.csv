geoffwood,Jersey,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SCLJX9WW12Z0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFC74ZKS,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 3, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"This is a rather strange little garment that lands pretty much like a jersey. I guess it is trying for streetwear and retro Y2K sportwear. It pretty well pulls the vibe/aesthetic off, but does the Aesthetic English thing of just throwing word salad on the shirt, plus an eagle backed by flame colors. I think it looks rad, actually. The fabric is a little off from the normal texture of a jersey, being a little thin, but it is much more comfortable than I would have expected form opening the package. The sizing is true to the size chart, which, take note, is larger than standard American size, so do size down if you want a tighter fit (I sure did!) Very fun and stylish shirt.",
