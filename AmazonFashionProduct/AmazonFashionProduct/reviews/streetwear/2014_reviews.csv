angelintouch,This is the perfect soccer shirt.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36A98CKDKORIE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5D2DG4L,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 16, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Mexico Green,,This is a great looking soccer shirt for any soccer fan! You have so many countries to choose from you can stock up with as many soccer leagues as you want. This is tight fitting for that stylish look anyone is looking for. The arms and crop top waistline is perfect when you wear jeans or denim shorts. This is a high quality shirt that won't fade easily after a few washes. A nice product.,
CJ,Cute!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WY8P8YL2L8T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5D2DG4L,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 28, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Brasil Yellow,,Shirt is cute but definitely more cropped than expected. Obviously description says crop top but stock photos are showing a shirt that’s longer than actual item so look out for that. However the shirt is cute if you like a shorter crop top! Colors are vibrant and pop! Will definitely need to wear with some high waisted pants or leggings,
Paige,Got so many compliments,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1775ABXENCT72/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5D2DG4L,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 27, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Mexico Green,,This shirt just screams basic y2k shirt and I love it. Very simple but cute. Not the softest well made shirt but still comfortable. The fit was a little loose but I just tied it with a hair tie in the back like the y2k days and it made it look so much more cuter. Would definitely order again,2

Remy,Coarse Material & Tight In The Arms,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JKJKYS5ERJ16/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5D2DG4L,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 21, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Mexico Green,,"My Niece recently moved in with me. I am of Mexican descent and was looking for something to show national pride when we watch soccer matches.  This basic shirt will only survive a few washes and is good enough to wear to a soccer match, but this material is coarse, and the sleeves are cut very small.  This is a $10.00 shirt at best.",

Devon Rizzo,"Cute, but has a much higher crop than advertised",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9IXJZLCNJTWX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5D2DG4L,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 17, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Brasil Yellow,,"In terms of overall quality, it's great. The fabric is thick and comfortable, and the colors are bright and vivid (for reference, I ordered the 'Brasil Yellow' style). Also, I like how it says 'Brasil' versus 'Brazil', which is how the country is actually spelled in Brasil. I decided to go with a Medium even though my normal size is a Small, and I'm glad I did. Its form fitting without being overly tight on my chest or torso. It washed great, and I didn't notice any issues with fading or the colors bleeding. However, the crop is quite high on me and shows a lot of my stomach. I'll need to wear it with high waisted shorts or jeans, which is fine, but I was hoping it'd be a little longer like the stock photos show.",
Robert,"Arms are tight, runs small",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AMNIFLSS00EW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5D2DG4L,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 17, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Mexico Green,,"I’m a small/medium and got a large. Fits in body but arms are tight. Granted I do have larger arms but still think they’re tight even if I didn’t. Cute and okay quality, not the best though.",
