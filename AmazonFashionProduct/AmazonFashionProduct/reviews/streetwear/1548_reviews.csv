These hit the mark perfectly. Fabric was super soft, nice large pockets and stretchy waist band. I am 5’7 170 got a medium and they fit perfect. Here’s the bad side.. I obviously got a pair that had been worn and returned because the tag was cut and there was something brown smudged on the seat area.",

Phoenicia,SO SOFT,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15O05JBD0G5CC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKR1VKVD,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 1, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Pink,,These are like the best cargo pants I have ever was. They're probably the comfiest I've ever warn too. The material used for these in particular is like super super soft. I think the color is really pretty. I love the pockets on the sides/front of the pants they have a little draw string you can pull to tighten them which adds a kind of scrunchy like look that I think really nice. I love these so much my only complaint is that there's only a back pocket on the right side and not also on the left side. I highly highly recommend these!!,4
Dakota,So comfy!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UM3UJHVPN7K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKR1VKVD,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 19, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,,I'm wearing these pants as I write this and I LOVE them. They fit perfect and have a little stretch in the waistband. The pockets have buttons on the sides to keep your items secure. I love that you can also tie them at the bottom. They have belt loops as well. The zipper feels super durable and so far they've also been very easy to keep clean- I got these in black and have a white dog that sheds but these were no problem with a once-over with the lint roller.,2
