It's very comfortable, just wish I would have ordered down yet another size.",

Basically became my most heavily rotated shirt for the past month and I've gotten tons of compliments so far. Really dig the design, really artsy, will definitely be getting more shirts from these guys because this one will last 10 years easy. I'm not normally someone who wears baggy shirts, but this one is baggy in a more fitted sort of way. Absolutely recommend picking one of these up.",

R,print is a bit strange,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GBX5KODV0HAP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D16R5XXP,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 5, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,,I love the oversized fit of this shirt and how thick the material is.
