This is simple, but fun and bold. My 15-year-old daughter wears it, and likes it.  The material is pretty basic, and the stitching is done tightly. It seems like it will last at least a couple of seasonal cycles, which sounds about right. My daughter says the shirt is comfortable, with a soft feel, breathable fabric, and a flattering look.  After washing and drying for a couple of cycles, the shirt still looks and feels like new.  One small issue -- be aware of the sizing. The product photos show it with a little bit of room. But it's actually somewhat body-hugging, perhaps even a half-size smaller than what's stated. It's still comfortable, but be aware of this if you're looking for a slightly loose size, as shown.  This is a fun summer shirt. I recommend it.",
