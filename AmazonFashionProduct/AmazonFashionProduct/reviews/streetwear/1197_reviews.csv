I got a large because I wanted them to be baggier in the legs, and joggers usually fit me too tight if i order in my usual size (medium).  The fit is okay, maybe an inch to wide in the waistband, but its fine bc i usually wear a belt anyway, and now we get into the cons:  There is no belt loop in the back of the pants. Not sure what silly billy had that groundbreaking design idea, as there are front and side belt loops but no belt loop in the back, so i ended up sewing my own on.  These are also not cargo pants, as there are no cargo pockets or back pockets. The only pockets in these “cargs” are the front ones and although they are good deep pockets, you can’t rlly call these cargo pants.",2

The waistband has a little elastic at the back which makes them super comfy, and the material is a lightly stretchy thin canvas. They were great for the festival and just for wearing around- only slight downside is the closure. There's a very rough zipper so just be careful not to catch it on your nails- and the closure is a regular button which is a little weird but whatever",2

I was not violent with them, I was merely tightening the straps a smidge.  I can't fault tge comfortability of the pants, however due to the thinness, I know I won't be avle to wear them in the winter. I maybe also would've preferred buttons to close, instead of one button and a zipper, because the zipper used is incredibly stiff and hard to close.",4
