I was able to order a sweatshirt through the Vine program about 6 weeks ago. I now own three other sweatshirts and this jersey-shirt. Second- can we talk about the quality of their clothing? It’s impressive. They don’t skimp on materials. They don’t skimp on skill either. This shirt was better than I expected. It’s my first shirt from Aelfric Eden. It’s exactly as pictured I could go on and on and on. It is definitely worth the price.",
