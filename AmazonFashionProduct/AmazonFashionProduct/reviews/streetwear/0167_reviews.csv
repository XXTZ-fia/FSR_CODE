The cut is pretty much straight so no real fit here. The straps are sadly not made from webbing but rather just plain ribbon. The ribbon is too thin for the buckles they loop through, so expect them to drop and to have to thread them back through the buckles often. The elastic waistband is nice, but it doesn't feel strong enough - I often feel these pants slowly sliding down. It's not super nice having to keep pulling them back up, but the lack of a drawstring is pretty much my only real complaint. It's so rare to find pants with a fun color and design like this!",

Andrea,Love an accurate size chart,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24QG07HAINVIR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D399M8VB,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 28, 2023",Size: 4X-LargeColor: 4 Black With Chain,Verified Purchase,I was wiry because the size chart said I was a 3X and I usually wear like a 1X or a 16 at American Eagle. I ended up ordering a 4X so it would be a bit baggier and they fit perfectly. The material is like that athletic swishy nylon material so not super heavy weight but fine. The chains aren’t amazing but for $20 I’m not complaining. I plan on wearing these to concerts so they’ll serve their purpose well. I’m happy with the purchase,

I got it to wear to an outdoor Janet Jackson concert. Getting the right fit was trial and error. I initially ordered a size large and it was way too tight in the waist and snug in the buttocks and thighs. I then ordered an xl and it fit in the waist, but it felt a little too snug on my thighs. Because I really loved the look, I ordered a size xxl. This was a perfect fit in my buttocks and thigh area, however the waist was quite loose. I spent the night continually pulling my pants up. Another negative is that the chain broke and I had to fix it. Despite my issues, I wore it to the concert and received so many compliments on my outfit. By the way, my top, bralet, and shoes were also purchased on Amazon.",53

The waistband is a little loose if you have a small waist you may have to sew belt loops or insert a drawstring for them to stay up at a preferable location",
