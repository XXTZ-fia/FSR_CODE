I normally wear a size 20 and the XX-large is supposed to cover 20 to 22, but these are so tight I couldn't even fasten them. I would guess these would fit maybe a size 18 tops.  In addition, this fabric is so thin and light that it is virtually see through. I definitely do not recommend these unless flimsy fabric is okay with you.  If you do order them, try ordering up at least a full size and if you are at the top of the range in your own size and, if like your pants looser, I would even suggest going up 2 sizes. Not my favorite purchase by a long shot. Now I either have to lose 20 pounds to fit into these or give them away. Bummer!",

These are NOT those pants.  Instead, they are more flimsy nylon windbreaker-like material.  Might be great for bike riding in light gusts or walking the dog, but I wouldn't use them hiking or biking in the mountains.A little small size-wise, not exceptionally breathable or super comfortable,  I probably won't wear these very often.",

We have pockets. And room to move. In all the colors. What sets these pants apart, at least for me, is how freaking SOFT they are without the typical 'swish swish swish' noise every time we walk into a room. If you're a girlie who wear's typical outdoor pants, you know the sound. My ladies, these are silent. ALSO, while we KNOW these pants are ready for outdoor adventures, feel free to pair these with a blazer, your favorite band tee, and heels (or street sneakers) but you better be ready to give co-workers the link to these because you'll be asked. The PRACTICAL THINGS: I'm a size 6ish (5/2, 130'bs, sporty build) and LOVE the fit of the Medium. After several washes, the color is still rich. And they may wrinkle a bit on rack but wonderfully iron out as you wear them.",

They are a light weight cargo style pant that has a silkyish feel to them. They dont hold heat in so they will be great on days you want to wear cargo pants without over heating.  The pockets are a good size for what you would expect to find on womans styling of pockets.  I have a mommy tummy so these do fit a bit odd on me. The length seems fine. I paired them with a niceer shit I have and they dress up really well. My teen loves them and has claimed them as hers now, so it looks like I will have to get a pair of my own in a size up.",

My daughter generally wears 0/2 and I was a little concerned the Small would be a bit big. These fit her perfectly in the waist and have some give in the back of the waist so they’d fit someone a bit larger as well. They’re a bit long, but she’s about 5’3 and they’re fine with shoes on. They’re a nylon-like material, so they sound and feel swishy when walking. They’re good for her for work in food service. She liked that the pockets at the waist are big enough for her phone (especially as there are no back pockets).",

I ordered her a small and they fit her great. She is 5'1"" and 110 lb. They do not need to be hemmed which is the biggest win for me! They are extremely light weight. The fabric reminds me of a thin hiking pant material (almost like a ""parachute"" pant material). She loves them and will be wearing them all the time.",

The material is awful. It feels like a parachute. It’s papery and uncomfortable and thin. There’s no quality to the material. The image makes it look like a thick cotton pant. It is not. I got a size large and they fit everywhere but don’t button so size up if you want these. I wouldn’t wear these out. They’re just not comfortable and look cheap,
