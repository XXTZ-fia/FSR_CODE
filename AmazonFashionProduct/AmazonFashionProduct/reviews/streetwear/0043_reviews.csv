The only redeeming thing about these pants is the fact that they run true to size.  I really don't like the fabric or the fit, so these pants will never be worn.  I ordered the black in a size small.  For sizing purposes, if you are interested in adding a very high waisted pair of pants to your fall wardrobe, here are my measurements for reference; 5'6"", 34B, 28.5"" waist, 35.5"" hips, and I weigh 125 pounds with an athletic frame and no curves.",2

Seren,"A good bargain, love the fit in the waist especially",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZFFA0K60P76O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5XXM5C5,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 21, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,,"For reference, I'm 5ft 7inches tall, 136 lbs. My legs are medium size, and my waist is wider than I wish it was!  With that in mind, I love the fit on my waist. The construction of the waistband is flat stretchy in front and stretchy pulled material in back, making the fit soft and comfy. I could be thinner or wider in my waist and it feels like it would still fit just right.  The leg material is quite wide in my estimation, especially since it's a stretchy sturdy material, so on my medium size legs it looks a bit bulky. Not so much that I can't wear them, just I wish they were about 2-4 inches narrower on each leg.  On the other hand, since the material is a bit heavy, you could easily wear these over leggings on cold, cold winter days. I bet they would keep your legs toasty warm.  I do like the cargo pants design with pockets on the side of the legs, with real and useful pockets both front and back on the pants.  Overall, I like these. A bit too warm for hot summer days, but fall and winter are on the way. For ~$20 (at this writing), they are a good bargain.",2
