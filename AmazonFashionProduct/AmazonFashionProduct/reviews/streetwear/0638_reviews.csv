Odera A.,The pants are fine but they do not at all look like the image presented,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10PDTDX261ZSV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09D7QML9Z,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 10, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black-p8,Verified Purchase,"The pants are fine but they aren't nearly as baggy as I thought they would be and the pocket locations do not match those of the image. It may be because I'm a bigger stockier build, as a larger more muscular person the fence fit a little tight and restrict movement.  Also as many have mentioned the washing instructions are embroidered on the clothes themselves which is a design choice that I dislike and agree with many that shared",
Jeff,Washing instructions on the EXTERIOR!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPBTHS3OH0GNQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09D7QML9Z,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 23, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black-p8,Verified Purchase,"I couldn't believe what I was seeing when I took the garment out of it's packaging! The washing/laundering care instructions are embroidered on the back leg of the pants in large, bright RED stitching! How utterly ridiculous! All garment makers put care instructions on the INTERIOR of the garment, on a little tag somewhere or painted in a hidden location.  To embroider this information, EXPOSED ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE GARMENT FOR THE WORLD TO READ, is just plain stupid! I won't wear it this way! Returning for refund.",

Giinyiz,I love the design and the way it fits!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28NQM33N3F16H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09D7QML9Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 20, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Black-p8,Verified Purchase,It's hard to find a certain esthetic without the catch of bad material or NOT fitting the way the images look.

Mast,5’2” tmasc and it is the correct amount of baggy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HZESUKI2QFV0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09D7QML9Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 24, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Black-821,Verified Purchase,"Love these pants! Its so hard to find pants that fit as a petite masc person, these fit great!

Nicole,Has washing instructions embroidered on the leg,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CD34GIH5J85D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09D7QML9Z,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 13, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black-821,Verified Purchase,"Don't waste your money.

BmB,A little too baggy.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39CBA3P4BIT6A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09D7QML9Z,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 17, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black-821,Verified Purchase,"Ordered a medium because I have quite a few pairs of pants like these. I figured ordering these would be great. Well, they are definitely ok at best. I've worn them only a handful of times compared to similar styles. Translating the text leaves you more questions than answers, and even though it has some massive pockets, good luck with keeping anything in them comfortably. The pocket that is a smaller size has no buckles, buttons, straps, or anything like that to keep it attached to the flap. Disappointing at best.",4
Desmond Taylor,Fantastic,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SNOR354BAGIX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09D7QML9Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 14, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black-821,Verified Purchase,"These fit exactly how I wanted them too, and have absolutely zero complaints about them, if you're into the style definitely grab a pair they're for sure gonna last.",3

The fabric is lightweight, I'll admit, I thought it would be a little heavier, but with spring/summer coming, I'm actually looking forward to it. It also has oversized embroidered washing instructions on the back pant leg, which I like. These are so cool. I will be ordering some more from this brand.",8
Amazon Customer,Measure your waist and hip/thigh area and you'll know what size to get.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UKZBWVJL1S5Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09D7QML9Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 28, 2022",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black-821,Verified Purchase,"I like the material alot, the pockets are good one of them imma add a button to but other than that I love these pants. I was worried they would be too tight but Nope. 🙂 the washing label is very in your face but imma just patch up over it.",
Garrett,Very comfy and Eye-catching... but...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R91AMKY76YRFV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09D7QML9Z,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 26, 2022",Size: X-LargeColor: Black-821,Verified Purchase,"So I like... ALMOST everything about these pants. The colors are really cool the fabric feels nice, and the pockets are pretty cool. However. There are some glaring issues with these pants:  +The washing instructions are... embroidered ONTO the pants. This isn't something that is made super obvious in their photos, but you can see it if you look. The washing instructions are embroidered in red. Wtf? I am not a fan of this decision, but like the pants enough to let it go.  +There are these 2 really cool pockets along the thighs. Great, right? Well, mostly. For SOME reason, only the left-leg pocket has buttons. The flap of the right-leg pocket doesn't have buttons so it flaps very badly. Definitely going to be a DIY fix because that alone almost ruins the appeal of these pants for me.  But yeah, if you can stomach having washing instructions embroidered onto your ankle area, and can deal with a constantly flapping pocket... go for it.  If I knew these things beforehand, I wouldn't buy these again- however... not worth the hassle to return them and find a replacement",4
