Amazon Customer,"Tons of Compliments, Tricky Sizing Though...",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHUTPCO472X2H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BTT29XZS,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 28, 2023",,,"As a fan of vintage fashion, I recently tried out the ""Y2K 90s Vintage Graphic Oversize Shirt,"" and I must say, it's a blast from the past in the best way possible!  The first thing that stood out to me was the vibrant and eye-catching graphics on the shirt. It truly captures the essence of the 90s and Y2K era with its bold and retro designs.  The oversized fit of the shirt adds to its casual and laid-back appeal. It's perfect for those who enjoy a relaxed and effortlessly cool style. The loose fit also allows for comfortable movement, making it ideal for everyday wear or even as a statement piece for special occasions. It's a bit small for me, while still being ""oversized"" (Boxy fit). I'm 6'4"" with an athletic build. It fits perfectly now, but I'm very careful when washing it to ensure it doesn't shrink.  One of the things I appreciate about this shirt is its versatility. It can be styled in various ways to suit different aesthetics. The possibilities are endless, and it's a great addition to any fashion-forward wardrobe.  However, it's important to note that the sizing of the shirt can be a bit tricky. As it is an oversized style, it might be larger or smaller than expected. I'd recommend carefully checking the size chart and considering sizing up if you prefer a more ""oversized"" look. Additionally, the fabric quality may vary from design to design, so it's advisable to read customer reviews and choose designs that have received positive feedback.  All in all, this tee is a must-have for anyone looking to embrace the nostalgia and fashion trends of the 90s and early 2000s. Its vibrant graphics, comfortable fit, and versatile styling options make it a standout piece in any fashion enthusiast's collection.",

Highly recommend if sized right.  I ordered this in a medium. I'm an XS in actual sizing, but I love oversized. I thought since the ad says ""oversized"" ordering a medium would be safe, but I should've ordered a large or higher. I have a short torso and the bottom hem falls right on the bottom of my bum (awkward place to fall, especially in the front it looks odd). It's also not very wide, especially in the chest area; I'm a 32DDD and this was fitted to my chest which made me look boxy. Definitely size up a few if you're looking for oversized!",
