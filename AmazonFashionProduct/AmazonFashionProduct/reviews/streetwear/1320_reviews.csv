"This is tiny, not for a teenager or women. The product is made of partical board and is very wobbly and not sturdy at all. It’s truly a piece of junk for the money. If you choose to assemble it and want to return it they demand you spend hours to disassemble it and put it back in its original packaging for return. PLEASE don’t waste your time buying this item. You will be highly disappointed and out money.",poor quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13VWL4X1DWXBD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCM8R4XG,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 15, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,"when i got these i put them in the washer as i normally do, and the rim of the patches detached from the pants and left behind a white line of string. other than that, it was pretty comfortable. the waist band was tight and sorta felt like it was suffocating my waist. the color was cute. this definitely should’ve been worth about $15 though, so waste of money.",

These are meant to sit on your hips comfortably BUT there is too much material in the front so they’re not even with the back and your stuck with enough extra material that you must roll the front over but not the back. You can see it’s not evenly distributed and cut when you look at the waist. Also, the stars on them are not adhered properly so they start to curl. Let’s face it, you can wear them out when they’re new but after that they are house pants.",5

daju,These sweatpants look weird on the waist area.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VH1KXMFG8NHR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCM8R4XG,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Grey,,"The sweatpants run small, and the waist looks weird on me. The front part goes a lot higher than it should. Doesn't fit well on me because it is a little tight. It could have been cute comfortable sweatpants, but I am sad that it doesn't look as advertised on the advertisement. The material is a little rough on my skin. So far, I have worn it one time, but it is a little tight and I will probably give it to one of my daughter's who's smaller than I am. If these sweatpants are covered by a long shirt, it will look okay but seeing how it looks weird on the waist, it can't be matched with midriffs or tight, shorter tops.",3
