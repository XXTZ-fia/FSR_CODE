I will wear these cargo pants ... in warm weather. They are thin. That's not necessarily a bad thing. I have several pairs of pants hiking pants that are as thin and light weight. Those are made of nylon (not polyester), and I've worn them for at least two decades. I'm not sure these ZAFUL pants will last as long. They are comfortable enough and fit fine, but the quality doesn't match my old (and higher priced) ones. The ones I received had one very long loose thread. I do not like loose threads. For me, it represents inferior quality. The pockets do not have zippers, buttons or other means of closure. That's fine, I find such closures a nuisance. The pockets are deep, have long flaps and are unlikely to empty unless I'm turned upside down. It has no rear pockets but does have regular side pockets. For me, an elastic waist is essential. The drawstring is substantial and has metal aglets. I must admit, I much prefer cargo pants, or any other pants, that have a zippered fly. These pants don't have a fly. Overall, these pants are okay, but if I were shopping in a brick-and-mortar store (which I rarely do), I might keep looking.",3
