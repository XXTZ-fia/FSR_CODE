Well boy was I impressed!  I totally expected a paper thin tee-shirt with a thinly transferred graphic on it like I've received from other websites. What I got is a tee shirt made of some of the thickest, more durable feeling material I've ever experienced on a tee-shirt, and I'm not kidding!  I was also very happy with the mottled color of the shirt. It looks vintage without looking worn-out, and the variations in blacks give the shirt an interesting visual depth that would be absent if it was just a solid black.  The Doberman on the front is perfect as well. The transfer is thick and vivid, and the image of the dog is light hearted and happy. I really like it. What does it say to other people who see it? Well, you may have to have an explanation ready. So far I've just said ""I really liked the picture of the big, happy dog!""  The size of the shirt seems to run exactly on spec with other shirts. Order the size you usually order and it'll probably fit you fine.  Great shirt!",
