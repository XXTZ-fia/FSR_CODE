Feels nice. Fits nice. But one pass through a tumbling washer and the threads are coming out on the seams. It practically is falling apart now after just one wash with a delicate method of washing. Buy if you have skill in sewing. Avoid if you aren’t much of a DIY person.,

Pants fit well. The straps are so cool. The fabric is that polyester kind of slinky, sorta shiny in some light kind of fabric. I feels higher quality, well made, slightly thicker than some other polyester pants in these styles that we've tried. Straps are great. It's a gift for my kid who is 5'1 and I think this will fit fine. Kid is gonna love it. If you are slightly taller or bigger,  I probably would get a large to achieve a more baggy look and also because it was kind of pulling in certain places.",5
