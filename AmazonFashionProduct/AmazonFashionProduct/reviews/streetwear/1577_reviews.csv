These are so not jeans. It also says y2k Gothic grunge. They're just black/white plaid pajama pants basically. They're not flannel or warm tho. They're a thinner, light material, better for summer-type PJ pants but still PJ pants nonetheless. I would recommend sizing up if you want them to be baggy/comfortable or styled at all like the model. Overall not bad pants just the listing title makes no sense really and should be edited.",4

They’re definitely not child size or PJ pants like others have said. They’re not even close to feeling like a PJ and I’m petite and fit into children’s clothing, I ordered an adult small, the equivalent to a children’s 14/16, aka XL in kids.  This is adult sizing and they’re good pants. I never see flannel pants as strictly PJ pants , I have other flannel pants and never got told I look like I’m wearing my PJs. These are good pants !! They’re not the softest but they have a good material and not too thick or thin. The string is a nice touch and the waistband is stretchy. I’m 5ft 3 and they’re ever so slightly long but if you wear with boots or a thicker sole for shoes they’ll be just fine. These are a good aesthetic pant and I highly reccomend them!!",10

Also she doesn’t like how they crotch area hangs low, there the legs come together rub on the thighs.  Last,, these are a little short, just reach the tops of her feet (She is around 5’4”).  Overall , she like them for sleep pants, but they aren’t her favorite pair.",
