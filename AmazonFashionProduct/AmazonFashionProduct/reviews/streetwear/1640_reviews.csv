Digerati AL,"Cool, utilitarian and teen-approved",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D3S4R73CZZT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN4JJSKB,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 24, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Grey,,"I ordered this pair of pants becasue of the cargo pockets, loose fit, and the slightly vintage motif. Overall, the fit is nice with loose pant legs, well-support elastic ankles, and big, zippered pockets. The canvas is thinner than typical canvas pants but I think it makes sense because of the sealed legs means the pants need to breath a little easier. Either way, it's light and comfortable. More importantly, my teenage daughters both say this pair looks good when worn--a high praise from teems who rarely show approval for anything I wear.",
