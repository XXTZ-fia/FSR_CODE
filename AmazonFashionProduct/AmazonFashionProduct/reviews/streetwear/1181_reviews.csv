This is a man’s sweater as described, but I am a 5’5”, 110lbs female and I bought a sz small. It is comfortably roomy and great for layering. The look is very stylish and feel of the fabric is soft and not itchy. The writing, graphics are exquisite and it makes any thing from jeans to skirts looks very classy and is a great conversation piece. I’ve paired this sweater with ponte pants and ankle boots which looks simply fabulous and stylish. The seller is top notch, helpful and prompt in responding. I’ve additionally purchased a cable sweater from this seller which is equally beautiful and outstanding quality. I highly recommend this seller!! 👍",

I ordered the Van Gough and it is beautiful!!! I am so impressed with the quality, the fit and the material. It is every thing I wanted when I tried it on. I only gave 3 ⭐️because the smell is horrendous. I sprayed with fabric freshener, so much that the sweater was wet noticeably wet ti the touch, then hung it out to dry. Hoping the fresh air would make it better. It did not. I don’t know if I’ll be able to wear the sweater because of the stench. It’s very disappointing because again it is gorgeous. Maybe I’ll sage the evil smell out of it, lol. Something has to work.",

It is my favorite sweater since 2020. The video and pics taken Thanksgiving Day 2022! 2 years later :o  Things to consider when buying:  1. Do not put this in the dryer if you don’t own a fabric/ lint razor as lint balls will form … see sleeves for reference (my sweater has been thrown in the dryer at least 100 times. I razored the front as best as I could today but didn’t get to the sleeves or back. So far it took me 30 min to remove the lint balls from just the front so learn from my mistakes. 😪)  2. Buy a size up if you want it super baggy. As you can see my M is oversized but not mid thigh so if you’re looking for a super baggy style, order up!  That’s all! Give me feedback on my review 🫶",88
