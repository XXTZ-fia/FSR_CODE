I like the pants they didn't disappoint. They're a little lose on my waist but I don't mind because I can always use the string on the waist.

However, length wise, it's too length-y for me. As you can see from the photo, it cuts off a little bit.  I'm not sure why is that. It's probably because of me losing a lot of weight. Or these brands likes to make pants longer when it comes from sizing them ""3XL""  If you guys weight around 260lb (fat) like I do, I recommend ordering 2XL. Trust me they will fit.  It is value for money though. Really good fabric, feels nice between my crotch. But yeah XYXIONGMAO is the best source to buy pants for us big people and I'm not even sponsored by them.",13
