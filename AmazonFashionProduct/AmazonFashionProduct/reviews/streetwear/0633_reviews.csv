There is wording and a logo on the front of the sweatshirt as would be seen in clothing at the tourist shop in the area.  The design itself is awesome, and it does appear like a souvenir from Whistler itself. The sweater fits quite snug however, and material is almost like a slightly stretchy felt. This does not seem to be a cotton or poly blend sweater, and it is not as breathable as it looks. The hoodie itself is made of a different material, kind of like a pair of sweats but softer. There are also no pockets on the garment. Neither the long central kangaroo pocket, or two side pockets. That's another drawback, as hoodies often allow for lots of storage.  Overall if you buy it at least one or two sizes too big, and you do enjoy Whistler or the outdoors in general, or Canada in general, this is an okay purchase. The quality of the material is hard to gauge, because it is soft but it does not feel like expensive material.  Unfortunately I will not be able to wear it until I lose a little weight, which might be a good thing overall! I would easily wear this if I could, and yes I do hope to get to Whistler one day!",2

SW,Fantastic,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JKYEOQGQR8PK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CBBH6R7R,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 19, 2023",Size: MediumColor: 0-black,,"I saw this hoodie numerous times before ordering but missed out because it sold out quickly. I checked back consistently to get it; that is how eye-catching it was. While smitten with the look, I was skeptical of the perfect reviews. Could it be that perfect? Upon receiving it, yes, it is without a single flaw. Each year, I purchase numerous hoodies, both zippered and unzipped. And though I have achieved some that I adore, when it comes to this sweatshirt style (i.e., no zipper), I have only found disappointment. But this hoodie fits the bill. First, again, it looks great. The graphic embroidery is top-notch and instantly draws your attention without being a distraction. In other words, it grabs your awareness, but subtly. Another detail that sets it apart is the color-block hood, which you do not see on many sweatshirts and looks incredible. While I usually go for a regular fit presently (not slim, not oversized), the fit of this hoodie welcomes comfort with a relaxed but cozy measure. Combined with fleece material, it is not only comfy but will keep me warm on days I do not wish to wear a jacket (which is surprisingly often where I live). I was waiting to see and test the quality before concluding the price point, but I believe it is appropriate for its worth. While you can find similar-looking sweatshirts for nearly half the price, I am confident, due to experience, that they lack the same excellence and most likely will not last as long. In conclusion, trust your eyes and the reviews, as this is a 5-star piece of clothing. And if there are any negatives after owning it for some time, trust that I will return to update accordingly.",

I love the sweatshirt!  It is thicker than a standard sweatshirt, well made, and while it isn't fluffy fleece lined does have a soft interior that becomes very soft around the wrists.  The logo stitching is beautifully done and just glows in the sunlight, especially on the black.  And it is warm!  Not -20 warm, by any circumstances, but 30-40 degree warm and up.  Re: size.  Order normal size.  I looked at their chart and saw that I should be a medium, but ordered large out of an abundance of caution.  I should have believed it and gone medium!  Too large is still better than too small, but the sizing chart is accurate.  And lastly, the unfortunate hood.  It is a bit too large for the garment as a whole.  All right - it's waaay too big, and the color variation of white hood on black sweatshirt doesn't work very well.  And the pull strings don't work well either, at least not on my tiny head. If you have a big head it might work, but pulling the strings for me simply means the entire hood closes like a trap over my face, leaving only my mouth exposed.  So I'll just leave it lightly draped over my head or, more likely, down and across my shoulders. It does keep my neck warm, so that's a bonus.  And lightly draped it keeps the head warm in breezeless conditions.  Note that it's not waterproof. It's just normal fabric.  I should drop a star for the hood, but I like the rest of it so much I'm going to still leave it as a five.  It's comfortable, cozy, well sewn, and warm!  Please do note the hood issue, though.",24
