All the pockets are useful and the back pockets are reinforced on the inside where they would normally rip holes in the backside. Perhaps, it shall be longer before that happens?  In my experience, they will ride up and wedge if I don't wear a tucked in top with them. I think that the friction of the tucked in material helps them to stay put. I will be buying more colours because they are nice enough that I know I will wear them lots and having more will mean each pair will last longer.",8

Some people mentioned the bunched stitching on the inner legs by the knees….  When I first tried them on in the size that was recommended, the waist was a tiny snug, and the seemed maybe an inch short. I decided to keep them since I purchased them on a really good sale. Glad I did. They are super duper stretchy…and lemme tell you…at my age (49 😩) I love stretchy pants!  They’re beyond comfortable, super soft, and after wearing them for half an hour, they relaxed nicely, the waist was perfect, which allowed them to sit lower, and gave me the extra inch in length that I needed. I liked them so much after wearing, that I came back and bought a second pair. The only thing I don’t like on the dark colored ones is the light/white stitching/thread. I bought the grey pair, and it’s fine with those. And I reordered another pair in sky blue. I would have bought more colors in the darker shades if the thread was color coordinated.

On the downside, the material was a little thin, so I wouldn’t expect the pants to last long. The stitching is a little wonky in a thick/thin way. And the fact it’s white on green makes it noticeable (not a fan). The deal breaker for me was the weird stitching at the knee on the inseam. It’s folded and stitched on top of itself, I assume to maybe add volume or folds?? It hung SO weird on my legs and created bulk and an unkempt appearance. I thought it was a mistake but after a closer look at the product photos, it’s there. Just a warning to those who didn’t zoom in on the product photos!

You could get stuck in these pants, in the sense of they fit so well and are so stylish you could accidentally on purpose wear them every day for a week, they definitely support a dirtbag vibe, which as a known sometimes dirtbag, this is a compliment. That feeling of a fresh tee and dependable pants is so basic and simple in an increasingly unstable world, especially as we approach the holidays. All that pressure to be in four places or catch a plane that is delayed by a day, when the whole of Thanksgiving is four days. You’re stranded in St Louis, but your pants are familiar & comfy. You won’t be pinched and you’ll get that internal sigh when you sit back down at yet another gate. You could easily sleep in them if needed and they would look natural, intentional even, if you were all night DFW waiting for the morning connection to Louisville or Little Rock and delivered to your sister’s sister-in-law’s mere hours before the meal. Just put on a fresh tee, brush your hair and get down on it. They run a little big for the true petites and by that I mean people who have a short overall frame.
