It can be 60-70 degrees in March, then like last week, early May, a frost warning, and breezy winds.  Throw in the occasional cold rain as well.  Many Hoosiers favorite saying about the climate here is ""if you don't like the weather... wait"", which belays the frequent changes.  It's been like that here long before anyone ever talked about global climate changes.  Anyway, this is typical outdoor garb here for this time of year, and taking to school is not a big deal style wise.Comfortable fabric with nice I assume anyway, a modern design that will not look nerdy or out of place.  Price is pretty decent as well.  Washable, and can tumble dry on delicate.  I had to set a specific time on mine or invite shrinkage.  My dryer although supposed to be smart on regular will sense moisture, and keep up the heat till everything is bone dry.  Don't recommend moisture sensing dryers or normal heat.  You can put it in till almost dry and then take a hanger and hang on a doorknob or fixture.  While made for men, I suppose, a good jacket for women who tend to get chilled indoors with AC.

It's not very thick, so it's more of a shirt in a hoodie style, which is alright for some slightly chilly spring evenings but probably would do zilch for warmness in winter. The style is very 90's, which is primarily why I got it, it definitely looks like something I would have worn in high school... from a distance. On closer inspection of the garment, my favorite thing about this is the absolutely nonsensical text on the shirt/hoodie and the removable tags. The garment care tag will give you very little useable information, although it will implore you to ""no not tumble dry"" and to ""wash water"" and ""no chlotlne"". The text on the shirt itself is also hilariously nonsensical, and you will be amused when you catch a stranger trying to read your shirt and shake their head in confusion a few times as they struggle to figure out what exactly your shirt says as they start to question whether or not their eyes are playing tricks on them or perhaps they are suffering from a sudden but temporary bout of dyslexia. There is a tiny tag on the bottom of the front near the pocket with an also enjoyably nonsensical little paragraph. All in all I love this, although the construction and style of the shirt is pretty outdated and somewhat basic, it's quirkiness appeals to me greatly.",

The ""hoodie"" part is soft, and has a decent lining, and good stitching, but the edges of the lining were not cut very well. Lots of ""Irish pennants"" or thread stings if you turn it inside out and look at it even briefly. This does not make it any less durable, and it looks great on the outside. But it does make it feel as ""imitation"" as the idea of combining a hoodie and a flannel instead of layering them.  Warmth . . . well . . . yeah, it is better than going naked. It would be too warm for a sunny day, but too cold for at night, unless the night was balmy or even ""skin temperature comfortable."" And then there is the logo on the front. Meh.  Look, all in all this is a ""good"" (not ""oh my god! great!"") shirt/hoodie thing. You look instantly cool and hip slipping this over any t-shirt, or go commando and just wear this if it is warm enough, as the lining is not the most comfortable, but is highly breathable. Closely examining this I would say this is made professionally, by a company that cares, but they seemed to have cut a few too many corners to make this a winner.",3
