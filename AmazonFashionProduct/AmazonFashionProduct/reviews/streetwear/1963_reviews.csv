The fabric is lightweight and soft which is good, but it’s a bad choice for this design. The fabric is shiny like silk and slippery. I tried them on and walked across the room and they began to slide down, and slide down even more when I did the kneel-down test. The fabric has a tiny bit of stretch but not enough because I could see the crotch tearing open if I were to kneel down quickly. The straps are very thin and slippery so they won’t stay bound to each other, so useless. The pockets are too small and the tiny bit of Velcro isn’t a great closure. I also detest the white lettering phrase on the pocket; so cheesy. Niepce makes some nice clothes but these pants are a fail.",

Still, they're great. 10/10  (Left)The basic cargo pants are far less great, but still good. I bought these hoping for more of the same fabric like my first pair and was betrayed. These are plastic. They're fine really, but I'm so disappointed... 5/10 because it's not their fault, I just had unwarranted expectations.

So If you are 5'11, go for xxl (super fit or skinny) or xxxl (chubby to fat). I don't know, maybe cuz I am little chubby, but I think xxl might run little small for a lot of people. Material wise, It's actually very durable and thick. Feels really nice and looks premium when I put them on. I put those things on the side in the side pockets. Not really a big fan of things sticking out or hanging like that. And it looks really nice in the pockets like this. Or maybe you can just cut them off. Anyways, conclusion, a good purchase.",3

They are a nice thick and sturdy material. They are comfortable and the size chart is accurate. I am a girl with a big butt so I was a little worried about the fit as they are men's sizing, but they are high waisted and super flattering. Definitely buy these, they are great, especially for the price!!  The only downside is that they smell pretty strongly of chemicals, but that is probably from the packaging and I'm sure it will come out in a wash or two.",3

A word about the straps - I wasn't sure I'd like these on the pants, and figured that I could cut them off if I decided that I didn't care for them. The straps look great, and add a lot of style.

The zipper pockets will come in handy so no one tries to pick pocket him and ample amount of room for what ever he decides to bring.,3
