Maybe just a little bit loose around the waist but you just tie it and it’s all good. It’s good it’s baggy when you got small waist- wide hips.,3
Chris,Nowhere near the size they say!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RH9CE2HL6HJK2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGX82QNM,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2024",Color: Vs2-blackSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"If I could give 0 stars, I would I wear a size 38 so I bought the XL (range 36-38). I am not fat but I could not even get them above my knees. The waist was so small I would have barely fit one leg fully. Don’t believe when they say they run small and get a size up. You will need to get multiple sizes up unless of course you wear XL. Very Disappointed. Submitted return request immediately! Will never buy from this store again.",5

MsSushiQ1,AWESOME PANTS - follow the size guide!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QOTSYV9KV0HQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGX82QNM,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 17, 2023",Color: Vs2-blackSize: Large,,"I was thrilled to see this brand offered here on Amazon. I have a pair I’ve worn the heck out of and I was due for a new pair. XL wasn’t offered which is what I’d normally wear. I’m a female and my waist is just shy of 34.” These just fit, although they were really snug. I typically wear them when we go boating to keep my legs warm and dry. I can vouch for the quality of this brand - top notch. No loose stitches, excellent seam work, they’re just pristine all around. I highly recommend these pants and def go by the size guide. These were exact to dimensions per the one provided. I’m also 5’5,” and these were long. May have to hem an inch or two. If I was wearing these for everyday “street wear,” I’d leave them hems as is. The length and bagginess are part of the style.",2

I love the option to cinch at the ankles, and they are so fun and comfy. The definitely ""swish"" when you walk, so keep that in mind. I think it's fun, but not everyone might. Only drawback I can find is the price. I love them, but not sure if they are truly worth the full price of $49. I would value them closer to $25-$35.",3

I read the reviews and ordered up a size for her, and I'm so glad I did! She's normally between a 6-8 womens (or medium), but I ordered her a large and they fit her exactly as I hoped they would. She's 5'7 and the length is perfect. These have elastic at the ankle to tigthen, and they look super cute either way.",
Jay Bird,Perfect fit for petite,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MKP8AAIQSFS2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGX82QNM,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 25, 2023",Color: Vs2-blackSize: X-Small,,"I do like these parachute pants, they're so comfy and are a perfect fit. At just over 5Ft the XS brings the hem just above the ground with sneakers on. They can be worn pretty high on the waist and have a good amount of stretch so you can cinch them in with the cord, or loosen them as you wish.  They're baggy, and so you can easily wear leggings or thermals underneath in colder weather. The only minor point I'd mention is if you tighten the ankles there's a lot of excess elastic cord. I was able to tuck it up and under but eventually it came loose and drags on the ground.",

Definitely worth buying!,
