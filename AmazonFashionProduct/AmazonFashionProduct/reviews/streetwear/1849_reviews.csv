The fabric is light and the pants are super comfy from the waist/hip area. I’m 5’5” and usually wear a size 2 (ordered the smallest size). Everything fit great, but they were too long! Something easy to tailor, I just prefer to not make that extra investment. Will return them.",

(depending on the day) ordered a size 4 (normal size). These pants are made for us long legged ladies. I love when I can find a pair of pants that hits the floor or even the top of any of my shoes, flats or heels, which you can wear both with these pants. They are high waisted, as in right at the belly button (I have very long legs with a short torso), slight pleat in the front (great for hiding the perimenopause pooch), elastic waist band in the back. I own them in five different colors, grey, black, khaki, green and oatmeal. They can be dressed upped for the office or dressed down for casual were (yes they are that comfy to wear). I love the cargo, baggy look of these pants. I did take one star off, because the sizing/length is not consistant. I actually had to have the oatmeal colored ones hemmed by 1"" because they were actually too long (surprise)! I am excited to order more.",

I had a long, high-end dress coat on with them, but from time to time I removed my coat when I got warm.  Every time I did, I got several compliments on my pants!  And they were just basic black pants!  I originally purchased my usual size 10 and a size up (12).  Both fit, but the sized up ones are the ones that had the trendy, flowy look I wanted.  I have thick thighs and these gave me plenty of room.  I’m buying every color, for sure.  It’s rare I think that a pair of pants makes me look thinner, but these do.  The quality of the material is great and not thin or polyester-y (I paired the pants with a St John jacket.). I’m 5’6” and the size 12 was the PERFECT length with 2” heels. Probably even 3inch or my platform adidas.  I normally wear a size 10 but they were a bit snug in the waist and WAY too short.  If you look at the size chart, each size is a different length, for some reason, so if you need/want a specific inseam, be sure to check the size chart.",4
