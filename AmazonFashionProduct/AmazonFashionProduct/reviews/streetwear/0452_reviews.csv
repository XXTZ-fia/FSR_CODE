Joe,Cute- a little short,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XJ0SK1JDGD5O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9K8FTMW,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 19, 2024",,Verified Purchase,This shirt tends to run a little short. Material feels sort of athletic. Color is the same as shown. Cute but haven’t worn many times.,
Amber,Not the best material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R828C10BZJC1V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9K8FTMW,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 7, 2024",Color: 1-whiteSize: Large,Verified Purchase,I like the style of the shirt but the material is not the best quality. The shirt is double layered and the top layer rides up too much for me mind you I don’t have large breast. Love it when it stays in place. Hated having to keep readjusting it every 5mins.,
Polly,I LIKE IT (warning for my below 100lb baddies),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UGN1ULH89ZGF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9K8FTMW,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 29, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"The material threw me off guard a little by how thick it is. It’s not that thick tho but I expected it to be see through (my hopes were not high at all💀). Anyways Im very happy with the material. Now, im part of the itty bitty community so i was struggling to keep the top part in place since it kept sliding down a little(i ordered a small), so what I did was fold half of it under the fabric(I present two pictures showing the two ways I wore it) THAT HELPED A LOTTT! anyways I can honestly just get it fixed. OH AND ALSO I expected it to be more cenched to my waist but it was kinda loose at the end. I can also just get that fixed but that’s why I’m giving this a 4! If you’re not 4’11 and not less than 100 pounds then go ahead and buy! But if you are then girl…. I mean you better know how to sew🤷‍♀️. It is a cute shirt though so I DONT regret my purchase. 💗",2

However, this style of shirt gets pretty annoying to wear. i might end up pinning or sewing down the folded over part because you can’t raise your arms without the top part lifting inside out. embarrassing and annoying! also wish is was slightly tighter/less material bc this is a small and it’s a little baggy in torso and arms. but overall happy with it and keeping it for many occasions!",15
Noemi,Cute top but a bit large,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NHO99WI6EXLG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9K8FTMW,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 15, 2023",Color: 1-greySize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I ordered a medium size and it was bigger than I expected it to be. The material is okay but one thing that I definitely did not like about it is how confusing it gets when it’s inside out. Other than that, I would’ve returned it but I lost the bag that it came with and it apparently needed that to be returned. It is not see through so in the future I might order the white one but in small.",3
