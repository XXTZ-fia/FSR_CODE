Scarlett Remor,A Disappointing Fit.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL879GZR0J4ZW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4D654YH,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 7, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: 001-black,Verified Purchase,"I'm here to share my experience with the Dark Punk Crop Top with Chains, and regrettably, it didn't meet my expectations, earning just a 2-star rating due to sizing issues.  The first issue I encountered was the size. It was significantly smaller than anticipated and didn't align with the sizing depicted in the product images. This discrepancy left me feeling like the fit was entirely wrong and uncomfortable.  The second issue was the length of the top. It was exceptionally short, not at all as the picture had suggested. In fact, it resembled more of a bra rather than a crop top, and the tightness only added to the discomfort.  In summary, the Dark Punk Crop Top with Chains left me disappointed due to its inaccurate sizing and extremely short length, which deviated from the product's portrayal in the images. It essentially felt like a tight-fitting bra rather than the stylish top I had hoped for.",2

This is a cute idea, but small. Good quality material, chains are poorly made, and the wrap around the neck fit perfect but it would definitely not be a all size neck fits.",

However, it’s a bit of a two person assembly, unless you’re putting it on really weird. The neck strap bit has to little buttons that need to be looped for security, but the loops are so small that you need a pair of second hands to help you out.  It fit well and looked nice, but had a less than preferable security measures for the choker bit.",

I have a smaller chest and so the chains weren’t pulled out taught and so they were just kinda there all loose and weren’t keeping the design form.

The material does feel like a cheap bathing suit but I didn’t expect much else. I have A cups making the chain much too big for me but it was easy to just bend apart, take out parts of the chain, and bend it back in place until it fit. The choker is kind of loose but I also have a skinny neck. It doesn’t look cute with a strapped bra so definitely get a strapless and possibly backless bra. I just wore a sticky bra with it.",
kathy poplin,Feels like a cheap swimsuit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UVYM2X7OAC1P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4D654YH,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 9, 2022",Size: MediumColor: 001-black,Verified Purchase,For the price I wish the quality was better. It feels like a cheap swimsuit and the chains are as close to plastic as you can get without it being plastic. I do love the style and fit. Just seems more like a $7 top not a $20 top. I would not recommend spending the money on it.,
Melissa Oakley,Meh.

If you have a larger chest like I do, size up. Its like, perfect  Pros: Comfortable, cute, sizing up works  Cons: The fabric feels super cheap, the chain is loose fitting so you might have to make adjustments, the fabric is also very thin (I was expecting it to be the thickness of a sweatshirt which is my bad), the armpits were a little tight  Overall, its just not for me. I didnt really enjoy wearing it. It didnt look right on me (which is personal preference) Ill probably just return it.",2
