Received item today and it is MUCH smaller than it appears. I can fit it in the palm of my hand.

S. Womble,nice fabric,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1D4NB1IE2LIZT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CP5NN5L6,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 14, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I had to order a larger size in these for my husband, and the XL works fine.  I wouldn't say they run small, possibly a little more fitted than other styles.  The fabric is very nice.  I think it would be somewhat wind repellent so they should be warm.  They have many pockets, and with the elastic waist, easy to put on.  They are a nice casual pant for around the house or going out.",

These pants fit TTS- the elastic waist is great. Nice looking casual pants with reflective strips- great for at night. Pockets are good- there are two with zippers and two front pockets. The leg zippers are a nice feature.,
Mary in Maryland,"Fits well, Lots of Pockets and Possibilities",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22YM5FIZQQ0VN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CP5NN5L6,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Pants fit perfectly.  Really excellent elastic at the waistband.  Fabric is very nice to the touch & comfortable but a little stiff for easy movement.  (Probably be less stiff after washing.)  Pants are very good for a variety of casual wear activities.  The many pockets are handy & provide room to carry your cell, charger, wallet, keys, & much, MUCH more.  Reflective stripes on the legs are good for night wear or a different look at other times, like a good alternative to regular pants or sweats.  The zippers are a little stiff; could be better and smoother to use.  Maybe priced a bit too high.",
