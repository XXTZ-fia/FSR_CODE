Slim fit which looks good on my husband because he is thin, 5'10"", 150 pounds. The material is not too thin but it is unforgiving if you have any bulges. The sleeves are a bit short on him but he has long arms. It's a smooth knit and the cuffs and waist band are a nice slightly ribbed contrast.",

I took 3 images, in different light so you can see a bit of the Wine Rd color and the fit. One image is kitchen floor, one is bathroom light and the closeup is outdoors. (Of course, cameras also adjust a bit for different lighting)  It fits me loose in the chest, which is to expected for a Men's Small. The sleeves are ""just perfect"" and the length is a bit long on me. The length is also long in the listing images, so I think it is supposed to fit long. I thought the sleeves would be a spec longer - relatively speaking. So if you're a man, and have super long arms, the sleeves might actually be short for your comfort.  I like that the color is a deep dark red. You can see that it shifts in the light. The material is a knit and has a spec of weight to it. The neck, which you roll is plenty long. I might even triple the roll. Happy with it and I'll put it to some good use as cold weather approaches.",
The Arshad Family,Beautiful!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BRSRWWHNSHGS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXXMGDP,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 7, 2023",Color: NavySize: Large,,"This sweater is beautiful and I love the navy blue color too! The overall quality is great and there was no defect. I normally wear size Medium in standard fitting but I upsized it because it's a slim fit and I have a built/broader body. It's still a bit too fitted and I think an XL would've been more comfortable as I like to keep my clothes not hugging so much. But I can easily stretch it and it should work fine. It's not a really thick sweater, so you'll definitely have to wear a button down shirt or something else underneath it. However, if you live in a state where winter is mild, you can just wear the sweater with a t-shirt and won't be too cold (depending on the temperature). Overall, very happy to have it in my closet and definitely recommend it. Just consider upsizing appropriately.",

It's not that see-through type of mesh material but enough to be a good undershirt if you have a coat or you just want to add to your style like The Rock sporting a fanny pack.

Shrinkage may occur depending how you wash it. I recommend a cold gentle cycle and hang dry if you choose to keep this.  Unfortunately, I don't recommend this garment overall as it seems to fall apart, pill and fray much easier than I would hope. Before and after washing, I could tell that the fabric could have been much better. It seems to come apart just by rubbing it between your fingers. I expect a little bit of this from a knitted fabric, but this was to the point I didn't think the fabric would last long at all.  Probably good for one to a few days of use but I wouldn't expect to keep it in your wardrobe very long. Not recommended.",

I'm 5-foot-10, average build, and I usually wear size large, which is what I ordered. As you can see from my posted photo, the fit is perfect. I washed the turtleneck before trying it on so I would know if it shrunk in the dryer. It did not.  Priced at $25, this is a bargain. The style is suitable for almost any occasion, from casual to dressy. These sweaters are made in China, and the fabric is Viscose, which is made from trees.  I wasn't familiar with Viscose, so I Google-search the fabric, and here's a few notes to know: ""Viscose fabric looks luxurious, but it isn't expensive. Its soft feel and silk-like sheen make viscose rayon popular. However, there are certain disadvantages to this fabric, making it difficult to care for. Viscose rayon is very breathable, making it a cool fabric for stylish summer wear ... It also gets wrinkled easily. When exposed to heat and light, the fabrics fade and deteriorate. It is prone to mildew, and when wet, the fibers become weak. The viscose fabric needs to be dry-cleaned in most cases.""  I did not dry-clean my sweater, it seems to be holding up just fine, and it hasn't wrinkled.",
