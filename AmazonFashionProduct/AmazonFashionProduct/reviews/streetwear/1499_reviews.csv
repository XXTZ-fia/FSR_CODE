Nathan P.,Not bad,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD4Y2SYROHD9G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CY5K4KT7,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 8, 2024",Size: LargeColor: A4 Strawberry Baby Tee,,This shirt is kind of cute but the design feels like a sticker on top of fabric. The design is pretty cute but there is a bunch of scribbles that look almost like writing but not quite.,
Haley,Cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SH03P2Z95QXW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CY5K4KT7,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 23, 2024",Size: LargeColor: A5 White Strawberry Baby Tee,,"This top is very cute. I would not call it a baby tee as I associate that with being very tight and very short, like a toddler’s shirt would fit a fully grown person. This has some room on me, thankfully, and has some smaller sleeves and definitely a cropped fit. Perfect for the summertime as it’s not clinging to me. The print is perfect and it’s not see-through.",
