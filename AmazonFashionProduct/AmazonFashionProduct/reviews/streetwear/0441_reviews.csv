Kim Parker,This is more of a crop top tank top so not a fan of crop tops personally,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWSMABDZ032J4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3DN834L,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 7, 2024",Size: LargeColor: B-white,,"It’s cute and comes as pictured but it is a lot shorter length wise the. Pictured and I just don’t like to how off my belly after having 2 kids and my weight didn’t fall off like some of those lucky ladies that go right back down to their pre pregnancy weight, I’m def jealous.  But it’s all good I’m more of a conservative person and have never really liked to how too much skin in public.  So if you love crop tops tho is cute and would look great on you, if you don’t love them then I wouldn’t get this tank top.",

We basically took a guess and ordered a size Large.  This top fits as expected. It definitely fits well in the bust, and it is also definitely a slim fit, showing off a few imperfections down lower in our belly, but that is to be expected. The fabric is really, really soft and silky feeling, which is a plus in our book. It is not transparent. Love the big orange flower!",
