Zachary,"Decent Shirt, But Could Be Better",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R7BKL3MVKLK0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CW2ZZ97B,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: L,Verified Purchase,"The design on this Y2K Berserk anime shirt is great—the graphic is vibrant and definitely stands out. It’s a cool piece for fans of the series and has that vintage vibe that fits the Y2K style.  However, the material is thinner than I expected, and the fit is a bit off. It runs a little smaller than standard sizing, so keep that in mind when ordering. It’s fine for casual wear, but I’d have liked better quality for the price. Overall, it’s an okay shirt if you’re mainly interested in the design, but don’t expect top-notch fabric or durability.",

(Depicts Guts in the Berserker armor wielding the Dragon Slayer).  Speaking of Dragon Slayer... ""It was too big to be called a decal. Massive, thick, heavy, and far too rough....""  The decal is large and thick (which makes it feel sort of plastic-y so if you have a spouse that's triggered by textures it may be off putting but I didn't find it too bad myself). I do wish the image was more detailed like the manga panel it's inspired from but Miura was known for crazy amounts of detail, whereas this is more reminiscent of a stencil type design but I don't know if that's more of a limitation to this type of t-shirt printing.  Overall happy with the shirt and will probably buy others from the set.",

Guts has a second small eye on the bridge of his nose, there’s a weird floating hand next to his nose, you can’t make out the Guts in the middle holding the sword at all, Griffith’s face is an AI disaster, and Casca’s face is also super wonky due to the bad AI (she has no nose or defined mouth). I feel like the photo gives it too much credit, it is SO bad in person. Definitely skip this design.  Will say, the shirt itself feels like good quality and looks like a normal size!
