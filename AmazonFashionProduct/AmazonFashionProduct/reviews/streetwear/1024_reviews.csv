daisy,Breathable and comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG14OPS7AG0IG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C85QWZRY,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 14, 2024",Size: SmallColor: A01-pink,Verified Purchase,"This shirt is such a nice find! It has a baggy fit without feeling oversized, which is exactly what I was looking for. The bright color matches the pictures perfectly and really pops. The material is comfy—lightweight and breathable, but not thin or flimsy. My only small issue is the neckline, which is a little scrunched up, but it’s still cute and doesn’t take away from how much I like it. Overall, it fits well and feels great to wear!",
william t.,Great Shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RB6QXT4C00C3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C85QWZRY,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 14, 2024",Size: SmallColor: A01-blue,Verified Purchase,"My daughter loves this shirt, wearing it with just about anything. It looks nice and has held up well. I usually put it in a garment bag and do not dry it. I forgot and let it go through the dryer recently and some of the vinyl lettering cracked. But this is many washes in… I would buy it again. She is 5 foot three and 140 pounds and would normally wear an adult medium. We got this in a small and is a loose fit, hitting just above her hips. Recommended!",

But I'm old school, and we wore our stuff, and still kept them in great shape. It's a mesh material, so it won't be hot to wear in the warmer months.  I liked it and will definitely be sporting the memories of the 90s.",4
