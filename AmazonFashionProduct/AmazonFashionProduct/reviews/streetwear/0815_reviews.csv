It's a lot darker than it looks and the denim texture isn't as obvious as I would've hoped for. The art looks good but it feels cheap and plastered onto, your back could easily sweat because of it.  Unfortunately the shirt doesn't look like an Harajuku oversized shirt but just a normal graphic t-shirt.  I was originally gonna rate this a 3, but after mentioning all this I put it down to 1. It's just an overpriced graphic t-shirt.",2
