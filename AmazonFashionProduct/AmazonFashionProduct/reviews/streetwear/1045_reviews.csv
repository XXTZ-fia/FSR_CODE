Problem is finding some that don't cost $100+. Thank goodness for low cost overseas manufacturing. Since they didn't provide normal pant sizes, I was a little worried about these. They fit fine. Very nearly too well, since at some angles you can barely tell they are supposed to be extra baggy, but those are typical big guy problems.  They're also comfortable, though the denim is concerningly thin. Definitely not for hard use. Unfortunately, they don't have giant back pockets like my old Jncos did. They also reeked of chemicals when they arrived, and I ended up washing them twice before that got to tolerable levels.  Still, I can't be mad because of how awesome they were, and because of how cheap they were compared to actual brands. I'll rock these proudly until they disintegrate.",4

While i can't knock any stars off for my own misunderstanding, as a word of warning, these are not simply a baggy style jeans! They are almost parachute pants. I normally wear size 6 women's, I am 150lbs and 5'3. I ordered size Small, and they do fit very well. The leg is around an inch too long, but i like the rolled up look.  With a pair of chunky shoes and a tight top you've got yourself a Y2K dream outfit!",
J. Seader,Many Pockets,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IJID7DC9ADA0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2J2GD2W,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 29, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: A10 Black,,"I am currently wearing this pair of pants. They are comfortable and slightly baggy, with a range of pockets for storing a variety of items.  Along with the standard hip pockets and rear flap pockets, the pants also have a pair of slit pockets that sit in front of the hip slots. Additionally, a pair of Velcro-shut pockets are set on the outer thighs. This gives eight options for storing keys, wallets, spare change, or other items.  The pants are made of a sturdy canvas material that is lighter than a pair of jeans, while being more resilient than a pair of slacks. The material is decently water resistant, so it can handle getting splashed without soaking up the liquid.  They would work well as work utility pants, or just fine for more casual use.",3

I really like the wide legs and loose feel.  For me the fit is perfect. The jeans are comfortable, and I like the look. Even the slightly faded, worn appearance works well for these jeans. Although advertised as baggy, they don't look sloppy at all. I ordered Large, and it seems true to size. The jeans appear to be well made also. Definitely recommended if you like wide legs.",

Yes, please. I ordered these for myself and not my husband. The legs would be way too wide for his comfort. But they are perfect for me.  They're a little large (my fault as I should have sized down) but since the waist is fairly narrow, I can cinch the waistline with a belt and it doesn't ruin the silhouette I'm going for. Wide-legged jeans are all the rage now and it's so nice paying $30 bucks for a pair rather than double, triple the amount.  The fabric is soft, not so thick that it doesn't drape nicely and not so thin that it's unforgiving to your figure. I'm 5'8"" so I love the length of the inseam. These jeans work well with chunky sneakers, boots or heels, depending on how you want to style them.",
Jami,Great baggy jeans,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SAJ9D2F2H8O5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2J2GD2W,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 24, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: A10 Black,,My husband grew up in the 90's when baggy skater jeans were all the rage.

Made well, the coloring is nice and they wash well. They are very large at the bottom. I know it says baggy but the legs are very very wide. Luckily my husband doesn't mind that but if want a pair that looks more like the picture, these probably aren't for you. However they are very nice. Nice and durable and feel like they are built to last. He said they are very comfortable. They don't feel super heavy or like they are weighing him down. They have nice large pockets so he can carry everything and he said they don't feel like they are falling even if he has his phone and wallet in one pocket. Overall we are happy with them. I would still recommend them.",

I was impressed by this pair of wide-leg jeans.  They fit well and, happily, are long enough.  I am unsure if I will keep them as is, or cut them down to gaucho-length for the summer months.  In any event, they are well-made, sturdy, and substantial.  The zipper works well, and the stitching is top-notch.  This is a lighter, worn-look blue denim, which I prefer.  Finally, my laundering protocol will be effortless: cold/line- or hang-dry.",

The wide legs are WIDE.  Like, I'm not sure I can pull them off, style-wise, but I'm giving it a go, haha!  Very comfy.  I love that these have a ""pre-faded,"" worn kind of look - nothing bugs me like ""brand new jeans"" that LOOK brand new, and these are perfect in that regard.No complaints here, and for the currently posted retail price of $29.99, these seem like a reasonable value to me.",
