In my opinion, the quality wasn't even a one star. It was wrinkled as if it was wadded in a ball for months! It wasn't able to iron due to the material melting. It was a substitute gift due to faster shipping. My grandson kept them even though I insisted we send them back!!!!!",

What's old will always become new again. As a teen in the late 90s and early 2000s, I had to see what these looked like. They are surprisingly very nice. They are sized right and fit well. They are baggier but not like JNCO baggy lol. They are soft and comfortable and I ordered them for my husband but I have actually stole them a few times to wear for myself.",

The material is nice and cool. I love the baggy design.  They are like swishy windbreaker material.  They definitely need to be sized up though. They are really tight but was able to get them on. Thank goodness they didn't shrink when washed.,

Know your waist size and order accordingly, it'll fit. The material is fine and the stitching/tailoring is all fine too, no surprises. I got these so that I can take them off and on at the tennis court without having to remove my shoes. They work great for the purpose, the legs are wide all the way to the end. The look is what it is, it perhaps looks a little more ""sporty"" in real life than the ""funky"" look you see in the photos.  (Because the material is more like a wind breaker than cloth, if that makes sense). Depends, I guess on why you're buying them. Anyway, they work for me and I'm using them so I do recommend.",
