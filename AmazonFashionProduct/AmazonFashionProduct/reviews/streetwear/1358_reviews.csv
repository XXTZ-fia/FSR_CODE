The sizing was pretty spot on. I am 5’9 weighing 170 lbs, and have a pretty casually athletic build. A size Large fit perfectly around my waist, and the length came past my ankles. I loved the pants until I tried to wear them to work one day. I got many compliments. BUT….the pants design were not practical. I struggled with trying not to trip over the thick rope material located on both inner ankles. The strings were too long and bulky to be hidden and discreet when you are walking or taking your stride, so be careful. I actually stumbled a few times throughout the day and I was wearing sneakers. I found myself stepping on the rope even after putting a knot in them. Unfortunately, they are not drawstrings and stay at that length, which makes it hard to modify them. It was too late to request a return code so I could get my money back, but if I could then I definitely would. Again, great fit and sizing, but not practical for casual use.",11
