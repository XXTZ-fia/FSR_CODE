Saxon,Great quality + oversized!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAHIFGYAUN4A9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD7WDK9J,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 13, 2024",Color: 1c-blackSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"If you don't like thick/structured tshirts, do not get this. If you're fine with that you'll love this shirt! The sleeves are quite long on me but I'm 4'10 and wanted an oversized fit so it's okay. Length wise, the size I got (which I believe was a small) went to my mid thigh. The print looks great and the rest of the shirt has an acid wash effect. This is now one of my favorite pieces! Highly recommend as long as you're not looking for a standard/thin tshirt material.",4
Joanna,solid shirt!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R108J1820RG85A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD7WDK9J,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 11, 2024",Color: 1c-blackSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"it came exactly as pictured, so no major complaints here. i normally wear a medium in crop tops & a large is fine for me to wear oversized… however i would’ve maybe opted for an XL instead",
Tracy - Olympia,Cool shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWG4OJ9U0ALEX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD7WDK9J,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 31, 2024",Color: 1c-blackSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I love this shirt. It’s pretty long on me since I’m only 5’3” tall, but it’s still great. You could even wear it with a pair of tights like a tunic I think. ThoughI haven’t done that yet. I love the snarling dog, because then I can pair it with something really sweet and innocent and it creates an interesting juxtaposition. :-) In the future I’ll probably wear this T-shirt with a pair of flowered printed pants or maybe put a happy face button on the T-shirt. Something like that.",
Amber Wagoner,Great oversized fit... weird smell.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LZ20EUUYO2ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD7WDK9J,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 19, 2024",Color: 1c-blackSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"I ordered this shirt for my boyfriend's son's 16th birthday. He loves the shirt and wears it regularly! However upon unpackaging the shirt, we noticed a very strong metallic smell - almost like pennies or blood. It went away after a couple of washes, but definitely be mindful and make sure you wash it before trying it on. It also gets softer as you wash it! You can probably find similar designs and styles on other sites for cheaper, but I chose to purchase this due to Amazon's forgiving shipping and return policies just in case.",
SherniceCindy,So happy I purchased!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF0QLWG74866X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD7WDK9J,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 3, 2024",Color: 1c-blackSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,Firstly the shirt is exactly as pictured and the quality is amazing. I bought it because an influencer I follow recommended and I’m so glad I purchased. I definitely wanted the oversized fit and because it was already labeled as oversized I decided to go for the medium and I’m so glad I did because I think the large would have been a bit too big for the outfit idea I had in mind. Unless you like your oversized shirts extremely oversized or to fit like a dress I’d just get it in your usual size.,

Haley,It doesn’t look like photo,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LRA3K9IT64YZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD7WDK9J,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: 1c-blackSize: Small,Verified Purchase,The shirt hasn’t been washed yet. The only issue I have is the picture on the front is a print and cheap quality I feel like once it’s washed the photo will not hold up. It looks cheap quality as in the photo looks like a giant sticker that was made larger so the quality isn’t good on top of it,
