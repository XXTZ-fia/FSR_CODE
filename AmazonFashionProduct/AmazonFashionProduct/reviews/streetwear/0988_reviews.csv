It is such a beautiful color, the picture really doesn't do it much justice at all. The material is so soft and cozy, and it keeps the warmth in nicely. It washes well, and when dried on a low heat I don't think that there has been any shrinkage. It feels very high quality, and there hasn't been any pilling or shedding like there often is with the pseudo-wool type material. I love this sweater and I am heavily considering snagging it in other colors.",

Growing up in PA I have always been immune to all but the most extreme cold. However, after reaching my 50s my tolerance for the cold has gone down hill quite a bit. I can still tolerate colder temperatures than most of now they do start taking a toll on me. I bought this sweater to weather under my jacket when it is below freezing and it is very warm and comfortable. Excellent quality and very nice looking as well!",

While I prefer something more breathable, I wear it on its own just fine even though I am quick to sweat. It isn't so much a ""sweat-er"" but is definitely on the warmer side. That comes down to preference though. Also, I can use this instead of layering and it still has holes for a bit more breathability.  The sweatshirt looks really nice. It has a nice homely vibe. It not only looks fluffy and cushion-y but feels like it too. It is a classic style that isn't too aged nor is it too childish in appearance. If the rhi",
