Jbayse,Athletic jacket,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AQRPV2J9OAQK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9YGX417,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Pink Graphic,,I am giving this 4 stars because those that are athletic or into working out would really enjoy this athletic jacket. The  jacket is made out of a  polyester like fabric. It’s is thin and breathable. The faux fur lining is able to be removed (although the faux fur continuously gets in the zipper). This athletic jacket has rhinestones throughout the “New Orleans Fleur-de-lis” like design. The size is true to size. I would not classify this as a pull over or sweatshirt this is an athletic jacket.,
Luka,not bad!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33J1LH7QB694Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9YGX417,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Grey Graphic,Verified Purchase,"to start, this jacket is absolutely gorgeous. i love the design. however, i did not expect it to be as light and thin as it is. this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but keep that in mind if you’re looking for something more suited for winter, cause it is not the warmest. but it’s definitely got decent quality. the fur piece on the hood comes off which i think is neat. it’s also not super soft but comfortable enough. i think it’s worth it if you’re looking for something cute to style with!",

Item was a little thin clothewise for a hoodie. Faux fur part of hoodie was flat when arrived. Had to figure out to fluff. Little beads come off easy. But the girl loves it.,
