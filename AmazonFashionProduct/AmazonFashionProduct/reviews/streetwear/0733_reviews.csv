Alexander Andrew,cute but awful material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BNXH9X7MFRCD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BF3WZP15,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Pink,,"i like the fit and the color of the cardigan, however the material doesn’t not feel like cotton. personally the material determines wether or now i’ll wear it. 100% to 70% cotton is normally what i like. this just feels like a mix of polyester and spandex, or some other stretchy material. too much polyester not enough cotton. it’s too stretchy for my liking. feels cheap. will not buy again.",
Michele,Snug at first.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ROFCUG5ZS9UL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BF3WZP15,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I like the feeling, it doesn't grab or anything, very soft. My only thing is that I expect it to fit loosely, but it is very snug— though you can stretch it pretty easily and have it fit looser. (I typically wear a 2XL if I want a comfortable loose shirt) It still clings around the arms a bit which is not favourable, but I'm sure I can stretch it more.",
Bellatrix,Great cardigan,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QMCZZT6MCV4W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BF3WZP15,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 8, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Just as advertised, oversized cute cardigan with big buttons. I have washed this cardigan 4 times and it still the same as it arrived. My own complaint is that the cardigan did smell horrible when it arrived, had to wash it immediately but it did not get ruined from the washer and the smell went away",
