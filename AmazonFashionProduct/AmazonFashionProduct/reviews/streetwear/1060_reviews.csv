Rats,Insanely small waist!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31KQG3Y0IT1CD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BW2W9BLS,"1.0 "," the United States "," August 12, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Photo is an XXLg. Cute pants but the waist would be a medium at most. Just ridiculous. Followed recommendation for sz XL and then went up a size just for x bagginess with 2X.  Jokes on me, that waist was completely unrealistic for a normal adult.",3

My wife had a hard time getting her to allow them to be washed before she wore them. They seem to be made with high quality material and the seams are strong. We will purchase other colors soon.,

Michelle from Michoacán,To all my teens,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVXE9320I7OI5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BW2W9BLS,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2024",Size: MediumColor: B Army Green,,"This is actually a really  good product. I surfed Amazon for days looking for the perfect pair of cargo pants at a good price, and I think I found them! These are perfect for school and do not wrinkle at all. That way I don’t have to worry about optioning or washing them. I got a black and green pair and they r so cute!! I will continue to look for all those out there who need more cargo pants suggestions, but overall these r pretty awesome! The only problem is they r a bit thin, but it makes them really breathable. (NOT see through) They have adjustable straps and simple pockets. TBH, I think these are great, and perfect for a teen budget. I know some other reviews might disagree, but overall I had no problem with these. Recommend! (The name is Erick because I am writing from my fathers acc)",12
