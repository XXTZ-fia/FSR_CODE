So I will say that it is lightweight, and it's relatively comfortable... It just doesn't look very good. Also, it fits a little small, so if you decide that you do want to I'd suggest sizing up if you're on the bubble between sizes.

I'm a small person and I get cold easily, especially at night. This is the ideal piece of clothing to take with me when I leave the house. Often times I go to a bar or restaurant and they have the A/C so cranked up I literally shiver. Or you might be out on a nice day in a short-sleeve shirt, but as soon as the sun goes down you get a chill. I keep this shirt jacket close at hand for just suck occasions.  The material is nice and soft. I opted to go with grey because it's so neutral it matches nearly everything. The cut is nice, if not slightly dull (which is odd for the COOFANDY brand), but I suppose even COOFANDY needs to make some highly accessible pieces to counter their more exciting fashions.  It really is more of a shirt than a jacket, and I would say it's corduroy; it's more of a waffle weave. As with all jackets, I wish there was an inside pocket, but there is not, just one breast pocket. Still, this shacket looks much nicer than a hoodie. It's a highly functional addition to a spring or fall wardrobe. If you buy one, I predict you'll get quite a bit of use out of it.",

I Really like the color.  This will be a good fall look.The title in the product description is a little misleading.  The title states that it is “Button Down”.  Button down normally refers to the collar in men’s shirts.  This is not a button down collar.  The shirt does have buttons, in the front, for closure.  The title also list “Pockets”.  There is only one pocket, on the chest, left side.I am 6’3”, 200 lbs.  There are two options provided for choosing the shirt size, the Amazon method and the seller’s chart.  Amazon showed I should get a large, which is pretty normal for me (L or XL).  The seller’s sizing chart indicated I needed a medium, mainly based on the posted chest size.  Most shirts are too short in sleeve length for me, but I really do not like a fat, baggy waist, so I went with the seller’s chart and ordered a medium.  Should have gotten the large.  The shirt does okay unbuttoned and worn out, more like a jacket, but it really too snug buttoned like a shirt.",11

This is a good shirt for fall or winter, it's a little heavy for summertime however. It's very comfortable. The only downside that I see is that it is tight in the shoulders so you might want to order one size larger in my opinion. I am 6 foot two, 255 pounds and I got the XXL and it's tight in the shoulders. Also the buttons are slightly large for the holes so you do have to work to get the buttons through the holes. despite these concerns I do like the shirt and will definitely wear it.",2

And it fits well.  It might be a little tight in the shoulders, but I work out.  And a good shirt to show those results.  That sounded awkward.  Let me say that this shirt fits a male shape well.Regardless of build.  I am about 20 pounds overweight at the moment and the shirt really hides that belly well.  Ten years ago, I wouldn't consider purchasing clothing online.  Now I am much less apprehensive about buying online.  The webpage has lots of pictures of this shirt.  And pictures with it being worn.  Almost as good as a dressing room mirror.  Nothing will replace the actual 'feel' of the garment in person, but knowing fabrics helps a lot.  I like the 'waffle' type texture - similar to corduroy.  The care tag states 100% polyester, but it feels soft like cotton.  It has a thickness to it as well.  The care tag also warns against machine drying.  I will probably hang this to dry.  It looks like it might need to be ironed as well.  Although not tailored or slim fit, this shirt gathers nicely at the bottom.  Not a huge flare like shirts that are meant to be tucked in.  Definitely a shirt that is intended for cool weather.  To sum this up, good shirt, good price, good fit and good quality.  5 stars from me.",5
