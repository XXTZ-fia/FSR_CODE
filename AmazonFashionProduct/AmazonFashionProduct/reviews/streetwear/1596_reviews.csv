After reading reviews I ordered a size up. They were way too lil. I could button them but I couldn’t breathe. I can say the pants I received were very thick which is perfect for me because I walk to work downtown in a city & it’s a wind tunnel between all those big tall buildings.  Not to mention we are right next to the Ohio River. I’m just hoping these aren’t entirely too long but I’ll update after I get the next size & can actually wear them. UPDATE-I wanted to get all the colors but I’m so upset that at 5’2 these are way too long. Returning  again :,

I am a nurse and have to wear the company provided ""uniform"" top. (I can wear the pants of my choice) I find these pants to be very comfortable and roomy enough for my thick thighs. (Most pants I find that will accommodate my thighs are way too big in the waist area. I love that I can wear a real belt with these and the belt loop placement in the back are spread out making the ""pull"" on the belt even on both sides - This helps my belt last longer (not just pulling in the center back). Where I work, we have to be keenly aware of Opiate use and overdoses. The cargo pockets are great for carrying 2 doses of Narcan, so I am ready for Opiate overdose emergencies.
