geoffwood,Graphic tee,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1U5W9SBE57H5A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFCN6Z6H,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 19, 2024",Size: LargeColor: White Letter,,"This is fun and rather bold little tee. It is a bit 70s punk and a bit 80s and a bit cyberpunk seeming all mixed together, with a healthy dose of aesthetic English vaguely meaningful slogans of encouragement. I like the style of it! The graphic is printed into the fabric so I imagine you will have a good life with it. On the down side, it is very blatantly a polyester tee and feels indistinguishable from the bottom basement gross, thin, weird, polyester-spandex tees. It is reasonably soft but does have a very plastic-y slick feel to it. The sizing is true to the chart presented but do pay attention, it is roughly a full size smaller than standard unisex/masculine American tee norms.",
