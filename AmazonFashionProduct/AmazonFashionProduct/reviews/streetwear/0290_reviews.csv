My kids on the other hand are kind of picky. I care more for durability, quality, and washability. In this case the material is soft and thick or atleast thicker than most t-shirts nowadays. It doesn't feel cheap. It is easy to wash. It is cotton but I dry on low heat so not worried about it shrinking. My son loves this shirt. It fits great although I did size up.",

Looks the same as the pics. Not top of the line quality but that’s to be expected. I like the color and the design is cool. It’s definitely not oversized so I would recommend either getting your normal size or 1 size bigger.,
