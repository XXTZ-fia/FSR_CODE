The combination of vintage vibes and modern touches makes these pieces stand out. The oversized flannel shirts are super soft and cozy, and they pair perfectly with ripped jeans or leggings. The distressed band tees are authentic-looking and give off that effortlessly cool, edgy vibe.  The quality of the materials exceeded my expectations, especially for the price. The jeans fit well with just the right amount of stretch, and the combat boots I bought complete the look perfectly. What I love most is how versatile these pieces are I can mix and match them for casual days out or layer them for a more bold  They’re comfortable, durable, and make you feel confident. Highly recommend for anyone looking to add a bit of edge to the wardrobe",

If you are tall and have long arms the sleeves are more like three quarter rather than to the wrist. But if you like three quarter sleeves, like I do, then this isn't a negative. But if you're looking for long sleeves as shown in the photo, you will be disappointed if you have longer arms.",

It washed well in cold water, tumble dry low, remove and hang quickly. No problem. However, if you ever happen to accidentally shrink 100 cotton, wash it in cold, then hang it up and gently stretch it back to size and shape. (You can also do this in strategic spots to get extra camouflage for your trouble spots!)  I ordered a medium shirt and it is loose on me just as I'd hoped, and a length that I like. I am not crazy over the color, but I knew that going in, so no stars off. I bought this solely because it is 100 cotton, which is so hard to get anymore. However, I can't wear it out anywhere. I have a 129 lb. husky malamute who blows his coat year round. I think when I wear this shirt that I have nearly as much hair as he does, lol. But I knew this would happen going in. I just really wanted a soft, breathable, comfy, cozy shirt for those cold days that I love to cuddle my dog and drink hot tea- and this shirt is PERFECT for that in my book!  I DO recommend this wonderful 100 cotton striped shirt.  5 stars",

It may be worn with skinny jeans or leggings, and you can dress it up or down depending on what you wear with it including accessories and type of shoes or sandals. It's an all-season top as well.",
