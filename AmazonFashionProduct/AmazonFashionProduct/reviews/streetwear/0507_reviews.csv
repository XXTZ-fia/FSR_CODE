Hannah,Shrinks and PILLS,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RN32BKSC9OOYH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPX4Z71X,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Patchwork Blue,Verified Purchase,"I got the color block blue one, and I don't know if this review applies too all colors/styles. This sweater is super comfortable but definitely has a couple major issues. It shrunk a bit when washed, so even though I bought a size up, the sleeves are now too short. Here's the biggest issue: it pills like CRAZY. I have a pill shaver and it literally needs to be shaved FIVE TIMES after EVERY wash. I don't know how there's any sweater left at this point. I've shaved enough off to have knitted another entire sweater. I really wish it didn't shrink and pill, because other than those two glaring issues, it's a great sweater. If pills bother you, DO NOT get this sweater.",

That said, if you are OK with those non-natural materials it's a nice sweater of reasonable quality. The seams are not knit in; it is sewn together, but everything lines up and the way the duck is accented with a 3-D stitch is very cute. The yarn is soft and this is a very thick and warm sweater. The neckline is a bit higher than a crew neck, more like a mock neck style. I normally wear a women's size L or XL. The men's medium fits me well. Slightly oversized in shoulders and length but sleeves hit right at my wrists.",

I got a medium and it fits so nicely. And I’m short, but the length is really nice. I dress modestly, and this length worked in my favor, but it may have been bc I’m short. The material is nice and thick. Genuinely one of my all time favorite prices of clothing. Might be buried in",

My teenager loved it and wore it right away. We washed it once according to the directions and laid it flat to air dry. The knitted goose design has started to unravel. We were unhappy, especially since it had only been worn two times before it started to fall apart.  BUT, I wrote to the seller LAIXTON and received great communication from them about wanting to make us happy. We received a replacement item and we are very thankful for their great customer service.",

It's only a little bit itchy but after a wash or too that should go away. :) The graphic looks great on it as well. My only gripe with this sweater is that the delivery time kept on changing.",

This sweater captures that energy in a garment, and when I saw it available for review I had to have it.It is everything I dreamed it would be and more.This is actually a really, really nice sweater.  It's not just a novelty - it's like, as comfortable as the several-hundred-dollar fancy sweater I got for Christmas a few years back.  This thing is no joke.  As you can see from the attached photos, the design is properly woven in all the way through - this isn't a junky applique or patch, it's a straight up finely crafted garment.  Totally unexpected.  If you told me this was from a major luxury brand, I'd actually believe you.  The fit is great - I was concerned because the listing showed a weird curvature around the shoulders, but it's cut normally in real life.Let's talk about that design, because wow.  It's a winner.  It's a goose (the listing says duck, but we all know better.)  It says WOW.  It's absurdist and a conversation starter and exactly what streetwear is all about.  I adore it.The design is actually a little low on the sweater - I wish it was about an inch and a half higher.  For me, it happens to work amazingly because I have a long beard that would otherwise obscure it.  For most people, I think you'll find the design to be a little on the low side.  Nothing unmanageable, though.If you're a little more edgy, you might prefer the pink version, where the goose is holding a knife and the caption says 'murder'.  To be honest, I pushed the order button so fast on the blue variant I didn't see the pink one.  I might have ordered that one if I'd seen it first.  They're both probably amazing.  I'm not sad I have this one, though.I gleefully showed my new sweater to a friend who is also a goose fan, and he said he would have ordered one of his own on the spot if it was captioned HONK instead.  I don't disagree with his take - maybe a third future design for Laixton to expand their offerings?  But I still kind of love the WOW messaging on mine.Eleventy billion stars.  I literally was pacing back and forth in front of my door waiting for Amazon to bring me this garment.  I can't wait to wear it out and about.  This has brought me more mirth than just about any other purchase I've made in recent memory.  You need this sweater.Wow.",12

This is truly a well-made product making it an impressive warm gift for anyone. Highly recommended.",3
