Fit as expected but the material is thin. May want to check and be sure you can’t see through them before you wear them out. Update 1/4/23 daughter has worn these a handful of times since receiving them for Christmas and the seam down the side of the pants is splitting. Do not recommend these, they have split numerous times. Unless you want to constantly repair them do not buy these!",3
