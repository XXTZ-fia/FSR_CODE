They're super comfy and they fit great. I've had them for awhile and I haven't had any problems with them until recently. At one point I was sitting down for class and they ripped from the cross section of the crotch stich and back to the right. I had another pair of pants and was able to sew these up when I got home but when I washed them recently one of the straps ripped clean off and then they ripped again in the opposite direction of the first rip. I do have thick thighs and I deal with problems like this with pants all the time but its a little annoying since I've had other pants that I've had for longer and worn more that have lasted longer than these. I'd definitely recommend these just be careful of how you treat them, the stitching isn't the best.",4
