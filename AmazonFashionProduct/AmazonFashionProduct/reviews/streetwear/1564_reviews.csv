MJ Poppyseed,"Comfortable, warm, washes well",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYZJWCSC2K1XM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B31PMXTQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Splicing-black-grey,,"Just know before you buy that the material is not sweatshirt style but fleece. It is super warm and soft and the material is thick enough to hold in warmth but not bulky and uncomfortable. I got a size large for my hubby and it's a bit big but he loves it to work out in the garage or do quick things outside in the winter. Great quality, versatile style with the two colors of gray and black. Love the hoodie that's large enough to actually go over the head!",

I have worn it almost every day for nearly three weeks to test it, and the material looks new after much wear and washing.  The fleece is soft and warm, but a warning: if you have dogs, it seems to be a magnet for hair. I have three dogs and constantly clean hair off of this sweatshirt.  Size: I usually wear a large. I looked at the size chart, and with my measurements, I was in the XL category. It is huge on me, which is okay because I wear it all around the house in very cold weather. But I would go with your normal size rather than the chart provided on the listing.",

While this hoody is pretty thick, I don't think the material is right for working. Think I would destroy this hoody just doing firewood. But other than that, it is really nice. Good to have in the truck after I get done working as something warm and dry to put on.",

He loves hoodies so I thought this would be great for him. This item is true to size and the colour was as advertised. However, the price at the time of ordering was just over $30. To me, this price is too much for this top. The hoodie is nice and soft and I was told it is pretty warm, by my son. I did not like the off white string that is on the hoodie, black would have been a better colour and the string could have been quite a bit thicker. It feels like a cheap piece of material has been put in there.  This is a decent hoodie, but I would not pay over $20 for it. So if you can get this on sale I would recommend this item.",
