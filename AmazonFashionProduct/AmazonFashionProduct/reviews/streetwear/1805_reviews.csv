I have bought several Aelfric Eden sweaters and have learned a couple lessons.  Some are made out out of thick soft cotton and others are mixtures of polyester and wool and are scratchy.  This duck sweater with his neck turned is a soft appliqué style duck.  Some sweaters are made with a running stitch that can easily pull and leave a run with a pile of yarn.  For the price you pay plus shipping, the fuzzy stitching should not be a running stitch like the sweater with the small ducks.",12
