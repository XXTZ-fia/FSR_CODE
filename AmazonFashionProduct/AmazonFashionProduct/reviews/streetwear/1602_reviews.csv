Josh,If you're going to read a review on these it should be this one,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22SWAMWZ3NIGL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07S6SBC35,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 11, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"So let me start this with this is the only pair of pants that I've bought or worn in the last 3 years. I have quite a few pairs and always eager to add more they fit me better than any pair of joggers I've ever owned and the fabric they use is spectacular and the straps on the legs are an absolute god send for anyone that really wants to utilize those cargo pockets, for my job we carry radios and I'm able to put a whole radio in one of the smaller leg pockets and the tighten down the strap and I'm able to sprint without my radio flopping all around and falling out. BUT they do come with their downsides. The thread and the velcro that is used to make these pants is absolute garbage for some reason. Velcro begins to diminish immediately on every pair, and the pockets on the legs begin to unthread themselves within a month or so of daily wear and the straps on the legs will just randomly completely come out on one side leaving a random long dangling strap sometimes right in the middle of the workday. For me though this in not much of an issue, I just replace the velcro and sew up the pockets and they're good as new. I would not be willing to do this if it weren't for the fit and quality of the fabric, to me that makes dealing with the thread and the velcro a bit easier to swallow. Plus as long as you use quality thread and velcro and not make the same mistake they did when manufacturing these then you'll probably never have to do it again which is nice, but really it shouldnt need to be done in the first place when there's literally just better quality stuff they could be using and for the price these cost you'd think they would just come with quality thread and velcro right off the bat. It's not a deal breaker for me but it could be for you.",3

Derek,3 and half years of wear,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D80PXLMB8KC2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07S6SBC35,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 2, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"These are by far my favorite tech/streetwear pants I've ever bought. They're made out of some sort of nylon material that is very durable, doesn't fade and dries out pretty quickly if you happen to get soaked. After 3 and half years of wear the only visible sign of wear on these is a small lining on the pocket flap that has kind of started to peel a little. Apart from that, the velcro has obviously worn out on the pockets around the thighs but they still function and I regularly use them to store my wallet and phone so I definitely still trust the pockets. like most techwear products, they feature some pretty cringe text on one of the pockets ""Land Combat Group: we are the land combat group | our duty is to create the walking armor to protect our selves in the reinforced concrete forest"" (yes, they wrote ourselves as two words). but after having them and wearing them regularly over the span of 3 years I can honestly say these are absolutely worth every penny. some of my equally old techwear pants are looking worse for wear and need replacing and I'm definitely considering just getting more of these.",6

If you really want to get these pants, order a larger size than recommended. Wearing the recommended size, I couldn't lift my legs or move around easily, limiting mobility. If you only walk, stand, or sit, then these would be okay. The right side pockets (x2) look like they could hold 15 round AR mags but I didn't test it.  The straps on these pants are obviously for show, but the included hardware slides off the straps immediately, meaning you will lose it. The first time I put my hands in the pockets, I could hear stitching ripping. I think I would've been better off getting regular cargo pants from somewhere else.
