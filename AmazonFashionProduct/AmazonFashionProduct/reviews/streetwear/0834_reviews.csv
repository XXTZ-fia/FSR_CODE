It’ll definitely last you a long time, the design and print is very accurate to the photo. Although the fabric texture isn’t very soft and I’d feel uncomfortable over time with long wear ((in a span of a whole day)). I wish it was more baggier at the bottom or even throughout the whole shirt as it's more fitted for me. I am on the bigger side so it can also just be the sizing difference if it’s from another place with different dimensions.",
