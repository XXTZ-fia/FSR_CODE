It's a fine looking shirt for the price, fits comfortably and looks great as well. The 100% cotton material is a little thick as other reviewers have mentioned, but not overly so. However, this means that the shirt will likely last longer than other similar shirts with thinner material. I washed it normally, but did not place it in the dryer and did not experience any shrinkage.  If you don't want any shrinkage to occur, I recommend that you air dry the shirt to avoid this from potentially happening. It's generally good advice to avoid placing cotton or linen clothing in the dryer at high temperatures to avoid any potential shrinkage, unless the tag clearly says ""pre-shrunk cotton"" on it.",2
