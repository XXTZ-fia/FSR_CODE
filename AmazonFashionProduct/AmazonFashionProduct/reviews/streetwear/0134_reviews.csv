But the fit seems a little off. Honestly it could’ve been a half to a full size bigger in the waist if you’re looking for truly baggy pants. But if being fitted in the butt and waist and baggy in the legs is what you’re looking for these are the pants. Good length.,

Hannah Hess,Let me break these down..,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MLG75RA6V1W5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YTGLVN3,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 1, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Apricot,Verified Purchase,"Let me start by saying I’ve been on the search for some good cargos for a while! So I’m leaving this review to break down everything about these pants.  Color: I purchased the beige and the brown color both are beautiful colors. The brown is brown and not orange and the beige is a true cool beige not yellow.  Fit: I purchased both in a small and they fit perfect IMO. I’m 5’3” ~143lbs with thick legs, a big Butt, and smaller waist. I STRUGGLE finding pants that don’t give me a waist gap in the back. These do not do that somehow. I will say they are snug in my thigh area but I just have thick legs so I expect that. They just hug in the right places without looking to small. The length is perfect on me where I can wear a sneaker or shorter heels with them.  Fabric: This took me by surprise. It’s a thicker twill/denim blend. Mostly cotton with a little bit of spandex. It stretches a tiny bit. It seems like those jeans that form to your body after wearing them a little while. May stretch out but I could def see them shrinking in the dryer some.  FLAWS: Okay… for the price point there should be a lot more quality control. I say this because of the two pair I ordered, the brown is able to cinch at the bottom where the beige is not. It’s literally two stings sewn to the inner pant leg. The lining of the pockets should be the same color as the pants. They have a white plastic-ish fabric which tends to peek out which is a problem on the brown ones. Lastly, my beige ones came smooth without a button and no evidence of there ever being one. Thankfully I know how to sew.  Overall: I really do like the style and fit of these pants. I think they should be cheaper or have some improvements to make them almost $40. I would purchase in other colors and would recommend to others. Just be prepared to make an alteration or two and don’t rely on the cinching detail.",10
