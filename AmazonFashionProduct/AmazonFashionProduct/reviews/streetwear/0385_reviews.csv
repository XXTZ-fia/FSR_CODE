But was disappointed that the “buttons” on the lapel were just for show and didn’t actually fasten them to the jacket to keep it open. That said, they do stay open on their own if you keep the zipper low enough.  However, I have to wear a ponytail when wearing the jacket because the studs on the collar pull out my hair - a lot of hair. If they would remove the studs around the neck, it would be perfect.",

The only reason I have given 4 stars instead of 5 is that, for a jacket that is so well thought-out, there is a design fault that reduces the overall impact. And that is; both lapels need a snap behind them so they stay in place when the jacket is open. If it hadn't been for my husband's nifty few stitches (securing the lapels back), a few minutes prior to showtime, they would have been flapping about all over the place as soon as the jacket was opened.  So if you can take care of this small adjustment, you have yourselves a solid 5 out of 5. Thank you very much!!",18

First impressions... made impeccably. The quality is top notch, even with the Faux leather and at this price point. Construction is fantastic. And the care they take to package it to ensure it gets to you in perfect shape, is second to none! Every piece of hardware on this jacket is wrapped in protective tissue paper and/or plastic wrap so the faux leather is not marred, nor is the hardware. Thin foam was also included to keep the studs from marring the faux leather when they had to fold it to place it in the box. They definitely took much care!  The Pink just pops! It's fantastic and the entire graphic design is just so much fun! I'm 5'6"" and fluxate between 137-143 lbs and the Medium fits perfectly.

It arrived on the day it was supposed to & I was excited!! 🥳 hub popped open the bagged package for me & as I went to try it on it had OBV strands of long blonde hair (genetic anomaly 🤭) caught on several of the ‘spikes.’ Took an extra moment to examine the rest & it was yellowing on the top half of one sleeve 🥹  For all intent & purposes: I was able to remove the majority of hair strands (w vid19 spiking, germs, & lice 🥴 it warranted my lysol). There were not many concerns outside of how long it was worn before it was returned. This factor may be considered or indicative of pricing.  Ultimately, it was purchased for a skate party that will be a dim environment. I do not think these small nuances (especially for the price) are going to stop me from grabbing two or a few (🤭) more.  This is one of the best purchases I’ve made on Amazon in the clothing department. This obviously isn’t a paid review 😆 THANK YOU all who recommended & to the seller for an awesome warm enough spring/fall product ♥️🏆🔥💃🏽",3

I do ride a motorcycle and just wasn't sure of the fit, comfort or sturdiness.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  The jacket arrived quickly (try before you buy).  It was excellently and efficiently wrapped, all hardware (zippers and such) individually protected.  There was a strong polyurethane smell upon unwrapping, but febreze and hanging to air out seems to have put that right.I have real, expensive leather jackets and I have cheaper p/u ones too. In the world of leather, sizing can be everything from unforgiving to just ridiculous lying. I'm one person and own 1X to 8X per labels.  (For reference, I wear a 44D bra, size 14-16 petite jeans.) This jacket, however, is all about cuteness, not practicality on a long road trip or anything.  It mainly fits as I hoped, a bit tight across the back on me, but nothing that restricts movement.  Roomy and comfy everywhere else.  From a riding perspective, it's a spring/fall option, definitely not winter.  The zippers at the wrists are actual, not pretend, thankfully.  The sleeves are nicely gored so bending at the elbows is no problem.  It's p/u with a nylon lining, so not luxuriously warm in wind, and will induce some sweating when warm, I can already tell that, but not important, just good to understand.  All around, a well constructed, solid, very cute, nicely appropriated jacket at a fair price!",42
