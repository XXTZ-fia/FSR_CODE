The quality of their clothing is superior on a consistent basis. This shirt has quickly become one of my favorites. I absolutely adore the color and the fabric on the shirt. I wear it frequently under my scrubs at work, but I also wear it at home and on the weekends. It goes with so many things that I like to wear. I normally do not wear the same clothing at work as I do at home. It's just kind of a rule since I'm a nurse. But this is an exception. I may just end up buying another one so that I have one dedicated for work and one for home. The fit is fantastic, just as pictured. I weigh 107 pounds and I ordered the small. If this shirt has caught your eye, I would suggest just go ahead and buy it. He will not regret it. Five stars.",

This does not impact the rating.**  I have a job that is at times very cold. This top was perfect for layering underneath my other clothing to stay warm. I ordered a medium for arm length and the fit is snug. This top is so warm that I sometimes do not need to add a jacket. It is also very comfortable, and I think it’s warmer than my thermal wear.  It is as pictured, though I would say the one con is that the shoulders sometimes have a boxy, stiff look. For me, since I’m layering this top, it’s not a big deal since it’s serving its purpose. One other thing is that this is not something you can wear unless it’s cold. It is a very warm shirt, so can only comfortably be worn in a cold environment.  Overall: I am very pleased with this and love that I’ve found something warm enough for the environment I’m in. In fact, I would say it is one of my warmest thermal shirts, and I haven’t yet found something that works as well.",
