TheWebWoman,Picture doesn’t match product,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E4YNN7E28YUE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BCFG77R2,"1.0 "," the United States "," August 12, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,"This picture does not accurately depict what the shirt looks like. My kid was expecting an oversized shirt with longer sleeves, a picture down the whole front, and a black “torn” strip at the bottom. The shirt we got was a basic teeshirt shape, not oversized at all, the print was like you would get on a regular tee shirt (not all the way down as shown here), and it had no “torn” piece. Material was like a rash guard. Not what my kid was expecting, so we sent it back.",

Unfortunately though, the skeleton design is weirdly low on the shirt, almost completely under my boobs. It is also not as long as it looks on the guy in the picture, doesn’t even reach the bottom of my fingertips and I’m pretty short/ stubby.",3
