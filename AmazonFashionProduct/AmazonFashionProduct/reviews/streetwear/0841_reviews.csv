Joey,Too sheer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CDO94NVCC7SE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX8SPKTG,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 25, 2024",Color: 7#blueSize: Small,Verified Purchase,The pants might as well be clear they are sooo sheer!,
Hannah Ford,Weird fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33GN5OY0TANDO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX8SPKTG,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 23, 2024",Color: 15#pinkSize: Small,Verified Purchase,These are very cheaply made and the weirdest fit I’ve ever experienced with a pair of pants. Not tall girl friendly either.,
Mel,Definitely not size accurate,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22YVEP7EISE1Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX8SPKTG,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 6, 2024",Color: 7#blueSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,I got my normal size and these pants were dragging on the floor and were  really wide. They are also see through. Very disappointing.,
Erica L.,Super Comfortable!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ENDN65DC4MT9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX8SPKTG,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 2, 2024",Color: 7#blueSize: Large,,"Overall, I really like these pants. I love the striped design and the fit is perfect. They fit true to size with a slightly oversized silhouette that is incredibly flattering. The material is comfortable and they have a very nice fresh appearance. The quality is average and I would’ve given it five stars had the material been slightly thicker, rather than see-through.",
MWAH,A couple of notes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BBBPIURX4QZP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX8SPKTG,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 9, 2024",Color: 7#blueSize: Large,,"Here's the thing, these might be slightly overpriced for what you're getting. It's really hard to explain, but the fabric itself seems really thin and I fear it might rip easily? However, wow, they are so comfortable and they look cute and totally do hit the mark when it comes to the current trend. The light blue is very pretty in person. Pockets for the win. Runs long and fits my 5'9"" frame (pants fall almost to the floor for your reference) and are baggy in a cute way. I do like that these only have a drawstring as opposed to a little white label that really makes them look strictly like loungewear. A note that is more about this trend: those in the know won't think you are wearing pajama bottoms out of the house, but it's a fairly tricky trend to pull off because these do look like pajama bottoms. Still, these are so comfortable that I quickly got over any self-consciousness over that minor detail.",
Hana Cutler,Best summer pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1N21ITKKQJQS7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX8SPKTG,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 16, 2024",Color: 7#pinkSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,Bought this to wear while currently 9 months pregnant and it fits so comfortably. If you have thicker thighs i would definitely size up but the waist part is definitely comfortable and true to size!,
Bethany,Obsessed with it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUNXS0V8F4RPP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX8SPKTG,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 28, 2024",Color: 7#blueSize: Small,Verified Purchase,I just got these striped pants and I am in love! They are so comfortable and the material is really soft. The color is vibrant and the stripes give it a fun and stylish look. Definitely a great addition to my wardrobe!,
Amazon Customer,Cute but cheap,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22HGT2T8I425G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX8SPKTG,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 21, 2024",Color: 5#pinkSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,They fit well and are pretty similar to the photos but the material is definitely cheap and mildly see through. Does have pockets so that’s a plus. Overall will continue wearing but idk if would buy again.,3
