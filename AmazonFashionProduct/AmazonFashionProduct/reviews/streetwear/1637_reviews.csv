Kimberly Davis,A bit disappointing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E8ZW9G2HT78I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDKT8961,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 8, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Khaki,Verified Purchase,"This shirt is unlike the photos in many ways..starting with the sleeves, they are clearly drop-shoulder in the picture (dropping past the model's elbow) however the actual shirt has standard short sleeves, some might even say shorter than standard. In the photo on the model, it also appears to be an oversized fit, though it's quite the opposite in person. The size large fits more like a medium both in length and in width, which is unfortunate as I purchased this shirt for my husband and he cannot wear a medium. While the graphic is vibrant and clear, it is a bit chunky and uncomfortable during wear. It also feels like it will likely crack and fade, or peel off in the wash altogether. Also several loose threads at the seams. The material is mediocre at best, I assumed cotton but this is most definitely a stretchy polyester, which they did list in the description so that's my fault for not reading far enough. Overall, it's an okay shirt. The pictures are misleading in terms of fit and style. Very fast-fashion-forward and not so focused on quality, I've seen similar items on Shein for $10 or less, so $20 for this shirt was not a bargain.",
Cora,I got this for my daughter to wear as a gym shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2B6A2FKNMX3TG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDKT8961,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 3, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Khaki,,I got this for my daughter to wear as a gym shirt so she could have an oversize T-shirt because that’s what’s popular right now lol but sidenote it is really well-made and the graphic is super bright just like in the photo,
Victorio,Cuidado! Las mangas no son como en la imagen.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21PM2QTBEYNT3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDKT8961,"2.0 "," the United States "," May 29, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Khaki,Verified Purchase,Las mangas son mas cortas que las de la imagen de la publicacion del articulo. Estaba seleccionando las camisetas de formato oversize y esperaba que esta tambien lo fuera pero no es asi. La tela me gusta mucho pero es una lastima que no tenga el largo de mangas que la imagen sugiere.,
geoffwood,Fashion tee,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QJ85YWSGQP2W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDKT8961,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 3, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,,"This is a fun little piece, a t-shirt that is somewhat in the realm of street fashion and somewhat in the realm of ""using English merely for fashion value."" The art on it is alien- and UFO-themed and broadly well done. The alien guy seems maybe downstream from the And One guy, or at least reminiscent. The phrases on it are the generic inspirational stuff par for the course for this genre. I like this kind of thing. As for the garment itself, it is sized as expected, no import sizing here, so buy as you normally would. The fabric has kind of a pre-washed, grey fuzzy look to it and is very soft, I like it. The graphic on the shirt is superficially applied like a heat transfer/iron-on sort of thing, so I would have some concern that it might have an abbreviated life, but that can vary and so far so good, so I will report back if it bows out too quick. Fun shirt, I like it!",
