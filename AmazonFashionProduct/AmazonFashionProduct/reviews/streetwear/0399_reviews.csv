When I ordered the pants again with same size XL, the label in the pants showed XL, however the new pants was 4 to 6 inches longer than the previous order and much wider in the waist, as well as differences in the quality of the seams.  This is a legitimate product review that shows inconsistencies in the quality of the product. If I order the same product again, I expect to receive the same product but in this case the fit and finish is completely different, even though the sizing label in the pants is the same.  I hope Amazon will not reject my review again based on a factual observation in regards to product quality.

If you hold them up to the light you can see through. It's not terrible, but thinner than I expected.  Also the pockets go down almost to my knees and the pocket fabric is kind of bulky and you can see the fabric bunch where the pockets are. I will probably cut off 1/2 the depth of the pocket and sew it so the pockets don't bunch up.  Why the heck is the drawn string so long it hangs down to the knees?? Is that trendy or something? It looks stupid. I could literally wrap it around me twice! I will probably take out the draw strong or replace it, because it's ridiculous.
