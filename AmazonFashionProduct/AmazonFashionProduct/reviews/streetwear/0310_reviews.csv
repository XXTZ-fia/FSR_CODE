Amazonshopper,The G in Angeles looks like a messed up Q,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM3W4U5NNRONK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CP3QLCQR,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Light Beige,Verified Purchase,Feels good but embroidery is not good at all. The G in Los Angeles looks wonky and could pass for a Q. Ordered a replacement because this is supposed to be a gift and I can’t give this to someone when the lettering looks weird. Needs better quality control.,
Renee Vecchione,Fell in love!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HIUVN9UA9KPT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CP3QLCQR,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Grey Blue,Verified Purchase,"Bought for my best friend as a Christmas gift! He’s never had Sherpa. I thought it would be too small, and that it was too “ bougie” of a style for my grunge skater bestie; but, I hoped that it fit well and ONCE HE FELT IT , he would fall in love! Thankfully, I WAS 100% on point! He rarely takes it off, and slept with it on Christmas night! It’s one of the top best gifts Ove given him, and I spoil that kid!  It’s top quality, definitely worth the price (I’m gonna buy at least 1 for myself!) I don’t think it shrank (if it did, wasn’t noticeable.) the style is “preppy,” but if a grunge skateboarding punk 30 yr old instantly fell in love with it- anyone will!",

I like the unique checker pattern and the branding is tasteful.  My only drawback is that the sizing runs a bit small. I ordered an XL and it is very much more like a L or even a larger M. Something to keep in mind.,2

Its nice and cozy and after one warm wash with other clothes it survived with no damage, not to say it wont happen in the future. But for a $14 chinese sweatshirt i think its pretty good quality and I would be perfectly fine with replacing it after a couple months just to have another one.",

After the second wash it had several areas that were coming apart. It was nice the first time worn however not worth the cost if you can only wear it once or twice.,2

However, it's bulkier than I expected, making it feel somewhat heavy and a bit restrictive. The graphic design is a nice touch, and the overall quality seems solid, but sizing runs a bit large. It's a good winter hoodie, but be prepared for a lot of material.",

It was so ridiculous looking, he wouldn't let me take a picture of him with it on, you just have to trust me on this one, They run extremely small. This is definitely not meant for big & tall men! It's very soft and feels well made, but because of how ridiculous the size is, I'm not giving it a high rating. This probably would have been great for an average size person, but since they offer the 2XL as a size, I figured we would be safe, especially looking at the measurements. My son is built like a football player, very broad shoulders and very solid.",3
