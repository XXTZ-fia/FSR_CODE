SheBlessed,Warm & Cozy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UOLXAPYXJSL6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9B93BKD,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"I misread the description (missed ""teen""). I usually like my hoodies extra-large  and baggy so that I can be comfortable. The 2X that ordered was smaller than I thought but now I understand why. Despite my mistake, I will wear this. It fits (less extra room) and it's warm and cozy.  The lining is nice and thick.  The construction seems sturdy. I'm just hoping it doesn't shrink in the wash.",

"Pamela R, Simco","Too tight/snug around the neck, otherwise perfect",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GM6HLTK4ARQS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9B93BKD,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 20, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I bought three of these Whistler hoodies in different colors, the price was insanely great. The look is great, colors and graphics are very nice, fabric feels great, and the fit is perfect, but for the neck area, they sure could have given some extra room to breathe! No kidding, I felt claustrophobic in mere seconds, I'm a woman with a smaller neck than most men so idk if these will work for men. I'm hoping the problem is just with the one of the three I tried on and that the other two will be fine because I really do think they're great hoodies. I hope I don't have to return them, maybe I just need a minute to get used to a more snug fit, IDK but will let you guys know.",
M.,Warm as hell!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FSRB6DJB76WX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9B93BKD,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 17, 2024",,Verified Purchase,Such a comfy cozy hoody! Pleasantly surprised by the quality and lightweight feeling,

thelatejc,Shrank after washing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TSKZWX1WXKPM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9B93BKD,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 10, 2024",,,This will shrink a little after washing causing the hood to fit a little oddly. It's still a nice hoodie and good quality but it does feel a little funny with the hood up now.,
"Charlee, The (Mostly) Happy Shopper",Comfy hoodie,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KYRIX8BVUKZV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9B93BKD,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 4, 2024",,,"This is a soft and comfortable hoodie that didn't shrink or fade when I washed and dried it. The graphics are well done and the colors are just as shown. There were no loose threads and the stitching is good. The inside is fleece and very cozy feeling, like being wrapped in a blanket. It's not too thick but isn't thin either. It's perfect to wear over a t-shirt during the autumn months, no jacket needed.  As far as sizing, I'm 5'2"", weigh 110 lbs with a slight athletic build and have a bra size of 34 A/B. I got this in a small and it fits well. The sleeves go to about mid hand and stay put when I pull them up. The length of it sits right between my hips and upper thighs. It's loose fitting but not bulky or too boxy. I'm able to wear the hood comfortably as needed and when not, it sits comfortably around the neck/upper back area.  I admit I hadn't heard of Whistler, British Columbia before so I googled it. It's about 489 miles away from where I live. The photos are absolutely breathtaking and now I want to visit there even though I'm not one to ski or snowboard, which is what it's most known for. Obviously you can visit during the summer as hiking is something that attracts a lot of tourists, but the winter photos just scream ""must see in person."" I just might do that now.",2
