The wide-leg design gives them a cool, relaxed vibe that’s perfect for streetwear. They’re super comfortable and roomy, making them ideal for casual wear or even for skating. The loose fit gives plenty of freedom to move, while the denim material feels durable yet soft. I love how they’re versatile enough to dress up or down, and the overall style is effortlessly trendy. If you’re looking for jeans that combine comfort and style, these are a great choice! Highly recommend!",

My trade doesn't really matter for this review. I just have the habit of beginning my reviews with that statement. One might be surprised to read that these jeans are for me and I am 55 years old. No, it's not some sort of end-life crisis. I've always been a fan of the baggy shorts and jeans. I still have a couple pair of JYNCO that I haven't worn to death. It's not very often that any men's clothing, especially pants, pops up on the Vine site. I ordered these as soon as they were available. There was a very long delay in shipping; one which I had to approve (saying I still wanted my item) when it was clear it would not arrive in a timely manner. I do not know the cause of the delay and feel it might be slightly unfair to dock a star because of it. I'm also not sure how I feel about the striped fading. It's not quite as prominent of the tiny Vine product image. When I opened the package and removed the jeans, I thought the stripes might be some kind of flaw in coloring. I checked the actual product and, sure enough, the stripes are there. Interesting. Anyway, the jeans are faded and worn. I don't know if they're pre-washed, or stone washed, or whatever; but, they feel as soft and worn as jeans I've had for a decade. They're very comfortable.",

wishwarriorx,"Solid Baggy Jeans, but Not Quite Like the 90s",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13N5V8FJSDHO8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHWZFYWW,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 24, 2024",Color: C10 BlueSize: Medium,,"I got these because they reminded me of JNCOs, and they did not disappoint in terms of fit. They’re loose and comfortable but not as baggy as classic JNCOs—I’d say they could use another 5-6 inches at the bottom for that true retro vibe.  I ordered a medium for my 32-inch waist, and the fit was perfect with no need for a belt. My only disappointment is the fabric—it’s thinner than the thick, durable material 90s jeans were known for.  Overall, a solid option if you’re looking for hip-hop-style baggy jeans, but don’t expect the heavy-duty feel of vintage denim.",

I got an extra large for my son, and while they are definitely a big, loose fit, they don’t fit his waist when most extra large pants do. It’s too bad the size doesn’t fit because the pants themselves are an awesome material that feels like it will last while also being worn into a very soft comfortable feeling. I feel like everyone’s favorite pair of jeans that are worn out but the material is heavy and thick so I don’t feel like they’re actually worn out. Hopefully that makes sense anyways, good luck figuring out the size because they don’t fit like jogging pants or shorts.",
