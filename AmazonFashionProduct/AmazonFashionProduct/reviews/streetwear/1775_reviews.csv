Jasper,Comfortable and Versatile Cargo Pants - Great for Active Men!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MWJAPNS4SM0I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3TGXV2L,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 18, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"I recently purchased the Men's Casual Cargo Pants and overall, I'm satisfied with the product. Here's what I like:  - True to size: Ordered M and fits perfectly - Comfortable fit: Waist drawstring ensures a secure and comfortable fit - Large pockets: Ample storage for essentials - Breathable material: Polyester fabric is flexible, wear-resistant, and allows for airflow - Versatile: Suitable for gym, hiking, trekking, traveling, or running errands - Pairable: Can be worn with a shirt or sweatshirt for a casual look  However, I'm not a big fan of the material. While it's breathable and flexible, it's not the most premium feel.  Would I recommend it? Yes, for the price, these cargo pants offer great value. They're perfect for active men who need a comfortable and versatile piece for various activities. Just don't expect high-end material quality.",
Oldschool,Doesn't fit really well,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AR4G8P23EIRB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3TGXV2L,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 16, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Army Green,,"I wanted to like these pants. I like the number of pockets that it comes with, I like the look, and I like the color of the pants. Now the problems - I'm not too fond of the material. The pants feel like they are made out of a thinner material, and feel more like pajama pants than pants that you would wear outside the house. Because of the waist sizes, the length of the pants are LONG if you have a ""larger"" waist. The ankles actually have draw strings if you need to hike up the bottom of your pants, but then you have baggier pants that you're sinching up so the bottom of your pants don't drag on the ground. They don't fit great. I wish they were sized like jeans are - length and inseam instead of just the S-M-L-XL-XXL sizes they offer.",3

Not crazy about the little snap flaps on the pockets. Unless you keep them buttoned, they just kinda flap around. Not liking the little elastic drawstrings that can get hooked on stuff, either.

It was quite hot, and the light fabric of these cargo pants kept me feeling cool the whole way. The fabric is incredibly light, yet tough enough to scramble over the jagged rocks at the peak. They got quite wet below the knee and dried out very quickly while eating lunch on a sunny rock. They have ample storage pockets, on the legs, and in the normal spots which is quite handy for hauling extra goodies. My favorite feature is the drawstring waist though. It can be adjusted to the weight of what you may be carrying, which is a BIG plus for me. They're perfect for just hanging out too, and look great !!",

My husband has been living in his since they arrived almost a week ago. He uses them when doing lawn work and while working on our car. He said the material is very comfortable, and even kind of repels water. They are quite baggy and do run a bit big. He normally orders an XL in pants like these, but would have been fine in large with this pair. My son typically wears a men's medium in sweat pants so I ordered him a small in these and they fit great. The quality and comfort of these make them an all-around great choice for casual pants that can be dressed up or down.",

The bottom of the legs can be pulled tight to adjust for the persons height and the rest can fold over the tightened part. The little snap button flaps on the side pockets don’t actually snap anywhere it’s just for looks. The pockets are all spacious.,

Made well with no string or loose ends. Great lazy man pants.,

These nice looking cargo pants showed up right after dinner, so I didn’t really pay much attention to them when they came. But when I looked at them the next morning, I was very happy with what I got. In fact, I wore them for three days straight! The polyester material is thin and incredibly comfortable. You get five pockets; they are all pretty big, especially the ones on the legs. The seams are done very well with no loose threads and there is drawstring on the pant cuffs so you can adjust the length. The elastic waistband is not overly tight and there is drawstring there for a more perfect fit. I am especially glad that the pant’s legs are slim cut and not big and balloon-y like a lot of these cargo pants.  There are two issues. The pants run a little big, especially in the length of the legs. And as you can see in the online product photos, the leg pockets show that there snaps on either side but they are just decoration; they don’t actually secure the pockets at all. That’s a bit silly, I would say. Neither of these things particularly bothered me, but you might have a different opinion. These comfortable casual cargo pants are an appreciated addition to my summer wardrobe. They might make you happy, too. Highly recommended.",

The fabric has some stretch to it. I ordered a size medium and for reference I have a 32 inch waist and i'm 6 feet tall. These fit me well which I am pleasantly surprised about as I didn't think these would look as good as they do.  The side pockets are placed in a flattering way giving my quads a fuller look. I have thick calf muscles but there is enough space from the knee down. I like the drawstrings on the cuffs as you can change the look a little. One small thing I don't like are the tabs on the pockets that just hang down. They have studs on them but no fastenings so they just flap about while you walk. The fabric is lightweight, and the army green color is a classic for this type of pant and works well with classic sneakers and a tee during the summer months.  I haven't washed them yet but hoping they hold out. They weren't expensive and I don't expect they will last for years but I like them enough to want to have them for a good while.",
