The matching outfit is impossible to find, as the design was created in 2018. I looked everywhere for the purple healed shoes and jacket they show on the pictures, but it's not made anymore. My teen loves them so much, I want a pair. I haven't found very many quality cordoury pants worth raving about until now. Like previous cordoury, it's not too warm, not too thick, not too thin. The material breathes. The size was accurate. Only one pocket (the right front pocket) was sewn into the material in reverse (might be a fluke), but they all function as pockets (not fake decoration).",

I thought they would have elastic in the cuffs to scrunch them like the first picture. They do not so you'll have to roll them. That's my fault for not noticing, just be aware of that.  Size chart for waist/hip measurements seems accurate. They're too short, even without rolling them. That's weird to me because they're marketed for men and I'm a woman, I'd expect them to be longer. I'm 5'6"" so not crazy tall. I wish the pockets had snaps or something, they're just floatin' free in the breeze. One pocket has a super heavy piece of metal for the branding, but it's easy to get it off.  I don't know, I still like them. Nobody's perfect :)",4

Colors are super cool & would love these pants if they fit, but they were just way bigger than described. I can’t begin to estimate what size they actually are, but they were loose on my larger relatives as well, so that’s as much as I need to describe.
