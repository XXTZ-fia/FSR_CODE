Ben-Gina  Fantaisie,Cute but huge,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHKSA2GLKM1K3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKX3G5B,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 28, 2024",Size: SmallColor: 001-red,Verified Purchase,"It’s a super cute shirt. I was so worried it wasn’t going to be cotton material but it actually was great material. The shirt looks like it cost $40+. The only downside was it was huge. I got a size small, I’m 5’6, have a small chest, and this shirt stopped like an inch below my hip. After finessing it a bit and tucking the sides into my sports bra, I made it work. I still wish they made an XS though. I feel like the neck line would’ve been cuter  And the shipping wasn’t slow. I ordered this shirt on Friday and it was scheduled to come to me that Sunday but ended up coming on Monday, which was okay with me because I needed it for Tuesday. Anyways, I highly recommend this shirt. If you don’t want you shirt to be too oversized, I suggest you find another shirt.  Also, this shirt is not sweat proof at all. The part of Florida I’m in gets really hot and you could see the sweat. It went away when it dried though :)",
Emerson,Great shirt for the stage,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTS792PLRZOP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKX3G5B,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 14, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: 002-dark Grey,,"I bought this for wearing on stage during practices and shows. The material is nice, doesn't shrink, sizing is accurate. I like that no one knows what the AW brand is and I can make up new meanings every time someone asks. The possibilities are endless",
