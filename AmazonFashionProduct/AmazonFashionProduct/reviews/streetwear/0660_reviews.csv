The chest an abdomen part of the hoodie feels like it’s somewhere between a medium and a large. While trying to put it on, it felt a bit snug like a medium would (without being too tight or uncomfortable) and when it was on it felt like I had a bit more space like a large. What’s weird is that the sleeves are sized correctly, fitting like an XL or maybe even a 2XL. It’s made out a thicker material than I was expecting and will probably do a decent job at keeping you warm, which is great since right now it’s cold where I live.",4

My only real issue is that the stitching on the big pocket seem to be unfinished and never tied off so on the top left and bottom right sides it’s come loose and you can see the thread having come off the material altogether, so, if I try to put my hands in the pockets, I can feel the pocket actually coming off.

I ordered an 2xl for an 16 yr it was a good fit but on me(a grown woman 😄) it fits snug on belly and shorter than on the pic which works if you want a more snug style with cute jeans. But for it to hang like on the pic. You should size up unless you skinny. Now the little straps on the arms(especially) get it my way. Washing my hands I need to tuck and roll them so they dont get wet. And dont even think about cooking in this shirt(change it. Do i know from experience no i just have common sense to see this a fire hazard. ) but the green color is very nice,4
