Especially this look, and all the color options. This modern take on a retro style looks great on most every gent.  As an older gent, I would prefer this in a natural fiber, alas, I can wait.  Natural fibers do not feel ruff on my skin, and will breath better. I enjoy this knit to the extent that I can compromise.  The pattern allows air to freely circulate so my fear of materials that do not breath is sufficiently mitigated. You know, we older dudes get a little spoiled, (lol). You may be surprised to find that the Amazon automated stylist is suggesting you should purchase a size smaller than you regularly wear...trust it!  I wish I had the first time.  This material REALLY stretches, which looks great on a guy who keeps in shape.  The style is also forgiving. The box shape and stretch of the body gives a guy a few forgiving inches for that dad bod.  This is so nice as most summer offerings tend to demonstrate every day you failed to lose those nasty hitch hikers around your waist.Great look for a minimal investment.  Really looks like a million.  I just received this a couple of days ago, so I do not know about performance, shrinkage, or color fading, but what I do know is all the compliments I have been receiving. For all the high tag threads I own this very inexpensive piece receives more complements, smiles, nods, and questions about wear to purchase, than all the $$$ designer items . Two of my local  young blades of business sport these threads in their TV commercials.  I am so enamored with one attorney, i regularly made note of his beautiful, expensive $$$, tailored Italian suits. In a new spot I  admired his new knit short sleeved shirts.  After a couple of weeks of drooling, I thought I would at least TRY to find one. I expected many hundreds of dollars $$$. When I crossed this on Amazon,I could not believe that all the shirts were right here...and CHEAP!  I pressed BUY, without a breath.  The shirt arrived in a couple of days, and I ordered the size I was told immediately.  This shirt is a MUST HAVE! You will never miss the few $, and the compliments alone are worth it.  When was the last time people you know, or don't, paid you a complement?  Can you remember how it made you feel? Buy this now, before everyone finds it.🌠For reference; I am around 70, and I have NO skin in this game. I am just a customer like you.",2
