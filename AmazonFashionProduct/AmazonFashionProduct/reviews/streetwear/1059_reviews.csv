I gained a couple pounds recently so instead of ordering my normal 2XL size I thought I'd order these in a 3XL so they wouldn't be tight on me.  Unfortunately the 3XL is a tad bit tight on my belly (which isn't all that big) and they're also on the short side, so I have to make sure I pull it down in front whenever I stand up. Other shirts I bought from other brands the 3XL size is a tad bit loose and longer, which is exactly what I was looking for. Since that 3XL was the perfect size I thought these 3XLs would be about the same...but they were somewhat smaller and shorter than other brands.  Another minor issue is the collar...no matter how much I iron it the collar always looks kinda funky sometimes.  Overall pretty nice shirts to wear to work...but I'll be replacing them all in the next month or so.",

This shirt would be a great choice for a bigger guy (like myself). I'm not sure how good this shirt would look on a slim or skinny guy.

I've had good luck with other COOFANDY shirts and pants. The color faded just a bit after the first wash; which is too bad it really looked nice upon arrival.

It’s a polyester fabric which is not as soft a many cotton or linen-cotton blends but does have a slight stretch to it and tends to be easy to clean and durable. While it is machine washable, they don’t recommend using tumble dryers so you’ll probably want to hang or flat rack dry it which to me is not ideal. It has a decent fit with more neck room than average for the size and isn’t too baggy despite being a standard size. For me it could be slimmer in the waist and the sleeves are baggier than I prefer but depending on your body shape it could be great. There are many colors to choose from and even though there is a slight sheen to the fabric it looks pretty good under any quality coat. It’s a yes if you’re looking for a bargain shirt with more neck room but there are much nicer options out there.",
