I read the reviews, and I was scared it would be too small so I upsized to extra-large. I definitely did not need to upsize.. I could have fit large or medium. As someone with approx. 27inch waist, the pants were too large around waist, but that was my fault for up-sizing. Nothing a belt couldn't fix though. I'm 174cm/5'9, the pants were not as long as I wanted them to be, but long enough for my comfort. I have 31 inseams for comparison. Some of the stars were wrongly placed, but I could literally care less because I wanted the pants ragged and plan to rip them up myself. The denim material is actual very comfortable and it arrived very fast. I can tell this product is cheaply made, but it's good for its price. Don't expect a perfect replica and definitely follow the correct size.",
