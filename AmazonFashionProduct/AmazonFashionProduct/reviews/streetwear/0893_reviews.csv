Aston Hoffman,"Cute, but…",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV8CEH3ADJD9V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D183ZN21,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 1, 2024",Size: MediumColor: 2-apricot,Verified Purchase,"This is more a fault of mine than anything but the bottom portion saying, I missed during purchase. 🙈 It’s definitely inappropriate for school/work. Also some of the letters are weirdly spaced making it look cheap. The fit is good and kind of soft so I’m giving 4 stars for that but otherwise wouldn’t purchase especially for that price. Much more comfortable sweatshirts that are well made with better designs at this price point. Don’t believe the hype on these.",5
FL Traveler,Cherry Graphic Hoodie - Message could be mistaken for something else,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7TT2MLN5AAHT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D183ZN21,"2.0 "," the United States "," May 17, 2024",Size: MediumColor: 2-apricot,,"I originally got this for my son, but.... it is probably better for an older crowd.  The seller's description says, ""A committed relationship features 2 cherries joined by their stems.""  Ok, I get that.  The text under the cherries says, ""Gosh Valentine, Don't you like me just a ""WEENIE"" bit?""  Hmmm.  My wife thought that was cute, but I asked her if the ""WEENIE"" could refer to part of the male anatomy.  The seller's title for this item says, ""Aelfric Eden Men’s Cherry Graphic Hoodies Streetwear Hooded Sweatshirt Pullover Hip Hop Fashion Hoodies Unisex.""  Marketed as a men's sweatshirt.....not for a younger crowd.It is not soft.  The inside feels more like a terry cloth towel, not something I'd wear.I'd skip this item.",3
a.amahle,90's retro aesthetic...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5EADKJQ2D3P6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D183ZN21,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 16, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: 2-apricot,,"The Aelfric hooded sweatshirt is such a vibe. The green-stemmed, red cherries graphic is gorgeously depicted. The graphic doesn't seem to be fabric embedded transfer though.. It seems to be more of a screen print. Still, the graphic is detailed and saturated. The color is vibrant.  I'm not particularly in love with the slogan printed on the front. It's kinda goofy to me. The font used to create it fits well within the retro theme of the sweatshirt. Thankfully, the ""slogan"" isn't glaringly noticeable.  I sized-up for a looser fit. I found the Aelfric hooded sweatshirt to be reasonably comfortable to wear. It's roomy. The hoodie completely covers my head with ease. The fabric is a bit on the rough side. Not what I would categorize as sweatshirt material. It's not cotton and not particularly warm. I think it's some type of blended fabric. It's rather thin.  I find the overall design and fit of this sweatshirt to be cute, but the fabric could use an upgrade. Especially for the cost.",
