Asad,Disappointing Quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R721ZRK9AJ9SN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CL4HJNZH,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Chocolate Brown Figure,Verified Purchase,"I bought this hoodie for my son, and while he likes the feel and design, the quality is disappointing. After just one wash, the hoodie was covered in lint. I had to use an electric lint remover because a regular lint roller didn’t work.  While removing the lint, I noticed a hole in one of the sleeves. I’m willing to give the benefit of the doubt and assume the hole might be accidental, though it’s strange since my son has only worn it a few times and only at home (no school yet).  The photos I’m attaching show the hoodie after I spent considerable time trying to remove the lint. My son likes the print, but honestly, for a few extra dollars, I could have bought him a hoodie from a better-known, more reliable brand.",
