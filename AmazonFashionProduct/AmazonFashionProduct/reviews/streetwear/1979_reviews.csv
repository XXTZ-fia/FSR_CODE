Pants are super cute. Only downfall was that the four bottom pockets have flaps where the button holes are sewn there but no holes. I just took a razor blade and cut the holes for all four so they have usable buttons.",

The only problem I had was the seam between the legs isn’t higher so your upper thighs might rub depending on how baggy or high you wear the jeans I suppose. But I just throw a pair of spandex shorts under and I’m all good to go! Too cute!,

AJ,"too small, cheap material",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2M8CMP7RLQWIK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX59T8CF,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black1,Verified Purchase,"Bought these for a concert fit thinking they would be comfy and baggy but absolutely not. Opened the package and they smelled like oil and chemicals. I made sure that I went by the size chart as well and measured myself because I was unsure that these would fit my hips and thighs and even bought a size up because I was still unsure.  This pair looked like it was made for a pre-teen, not an adult...  The lining inside was a cheap slippery material and despite it being a pair of cargo pants, they did not stretch OR have large pockets.  I'm forever betrayed by the fashion industry thinking that women do not need pockets.",
Daywana Blackman,Don’t size down!!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIOER8VZT9GCI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX59T8CF,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 9, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black1,Verified Purchase,"Upon placing the order, I looked at the reviews! The reviews stated to go down a size. I ordered these pants for my daughter’s 14th birthday tomorrow and they do not fit. I should not have went a size down at all. The pants are really cute tho. Now I’m sad because but only do I have to return these pants because they’re too small but now I have to run around to a store ( which I wanted to avoid ) so that my daughter isn’t sad on her birthday! Do not size down!!! If anything size up!!",

My daughter likes the fit, weight and color, but the snap straps are weird and don’t make any sense. They look funny when attached to the jeans. Why not make on continuous strap? There are no button holes in the pockets. There are buttons, no holes, so what’s the point of the buttons? In addition, the smell is disgusting even after a wash.",

It has many pockets, deep enough to fit your phone or something even bigger in. So that was very nice!! They came exactly as pictured & are somewhat loose & super comfortable. They’re true to size, and good quality. The side belts are optional and can be taken off or put back on. The fabrics a little more on the heavier & thicker side and have a few loose threads. but you can still wear them during the summer and not get too hot. they’re very aesthetically pleasing to look at & definitely give off that “grunge” & “skater” look. Overall, they’re just alot better than what I was expecting. I give five stars!! :))",6

It doesn’t look as faded as the model photo Online, but perhaps after a number of washes. I look forward to enjoying and wearing them. I came back to the site to see if they carry them in different colors cause I would’ve purchased different colors.",3

I love all the pockets and they’re all functional pockets. Ordered small, but I think it runs small so I would recommend sizing up. I weight 126lbs and 5’3” tall for size reference. The description says it’s baggy, but it’s not on me. Maybe if you’re shorter than 5’3, it will be. Jean is heavy weight because of all the pockets. Very stylish and trendy at the moment. It does have an emo and grunge look. Also, it has a strong denim smell hopefully it’ll go away after wash.",8

Tiene muchos hilos q se le salen de los bolsillos.,
