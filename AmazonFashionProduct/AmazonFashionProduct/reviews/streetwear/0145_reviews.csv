I learned the hard lesson of you get what you pay for. The sizing is TERRIBLE. I ordered a 3x knowing that these things run small. I'd be SHOCKED if I learned it was a large. I don't know because the sizing isn't listed on the label. The fabric is super cheap and so thin you can literally see thru it. See thru it so good I can read this review on my phone! Not happy AT ALL. The hassle I'm going to have to go thru in order to get my money back isn't going to be worth what I spent on it. My suggestion? DO NOT BUY!",
