The shirt is light and breathable, and I really like the linen texture. It gives it a little character over plain cotton.  - The coconut buttons add a nice touch of color to the khaki.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE  - While most of it seems to be well made, there were a couple spots where the stitching was coming apart.  - Being cotton/linen it does tend to wrinkle pretty bad. I had just finished ironing it, bent to tie my shoes and came up with a bunch of creases.Overall, I like the shirt a lot and will wear it regularly.
