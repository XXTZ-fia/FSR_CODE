MsSushiQ1,Runs Slightly Big,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RQTDSQ3FVJF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGLT33F5,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 11, 2023",Size: MediumColor: A-black,,"I ordered a top almost identical to this one from a different brand and it was huge. So I decided to order this in a Medium instead of my XL. While it does run a little large, if def doesn’t run large like the last one. I’m 43” around my chest (38/40C) and although I was able to fit into this it was a little too tight for comfort. My daughter who is a 34DD was able to fit into this comfortably and it looks stunning on her. I love the square neckline, but it’s not too open. You can still wear a regular style bra with this - no need for a strapless or bar with straps that are set wide apart. It’s very soft and washed well on cold (hung to dry), no bleeding. The lace adds a very feminine touch. I recommend this top and the size guide. But if you want a snug fit, I’d suggest going down a size.",8
