I purchased a 2XL and it fit like a small, I was busting out the seams, these shirts are definitely not oversized, like at all lol. If you're anticipating thick and boxy material, you'll be disappointed as they are the opposite. They are slim-fit, snug, and run smaller than standard sizes. The neck area is tight, and the material is cheap. The colours of the shirts are nice but I’ll be returning.",10
