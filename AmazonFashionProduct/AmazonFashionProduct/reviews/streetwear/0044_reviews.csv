The zipper couldn’t even close and it’s very tight around my thighs! There is absolutely no stretch at all and I get that jeans don’t usually have stretch, but this fabric was stiff and heavy which I did not feel comfortable with. I was expecting it to fit my waist since this is an XL which is my usual size. However, they’re very long and baggy on my legs which look ridiculous on me. It’s pretty clear that these jeans aren’t for my body type, I do not recommend them at all!!",
