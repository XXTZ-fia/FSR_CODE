PhDiva,Sleeves a bit short but really cute overall!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EAJ83E29VYTZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGXF5P8H,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: Beige Tiger PrintSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"This sweater is great! It’s cut a bit wide and it hit just at the top of the waistband on me. I went to 4 over 5 stars because of two things. First, the sleeves are short. They are fine when pulled down but because of the shape, they pull up to 3/4 on me. Second, the tiger pattern is not as bold compared to the background color as shown in the picture. Otherwise I like the thickness of the sweater and that it doesn’t stretch out. It holds its shape well!",

The fabric is soft, fit is perfect, and I love the balloon style of the oversized sleeves. The tiger design is playfull but not overly tacky, so I’m not self conscious wearing this out of the house. I threw it in my washer and dryer and had no issues.",
