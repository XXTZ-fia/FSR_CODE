Alyssa Bagwill Gonzalez,Good.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKEHY7IKYC5JO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8TRPJ2X,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 10, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I’m using an XL so that’s what I ordered but I could use a large, the material is comfy but thin like a costume feel. The only thing that is a problem is that the sleeves can slide down but maybe not if I would’ve ordered a large. The fit is nice, it’s stretchy and easy to wear as a bodysuit.",
Alicia Walker,Comfy and Sleek,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17NCGIK5U8AB9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8TRPJ2X,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 22, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,This product for the price is something you can’t beat!

Milky,super comfy!~,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UDRXIWUULJDP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8TRPJ2X,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 8, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I ordered a large and I honestly think I could’ve got by with a medium!! unfortunately, if I’m not wearing something under it, I can’t wear this in public 🙂‍↕️ however, I got this mainly to style as an outfit for conventions/raves so it’s perfect for such things! it’s super stretchy and feels like nice material, not cheap or uncomfortable. I really recommend if you’re wanting to make a super cute outfit 🖤",
Taylor,"Should've got a smaller size, but would've came in late",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O6SRJWVG7ZMA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8TRPJ2X,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 28, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"So, I should have gotten an XS with this product, but chose against it because it would have been delivered later than the date I needed (Halloween). I'm 5'1 and around 88-90 lbs, and I wear a B cup. The fabric is soft, stretchy. For me it's baggy on the back, so I just used safety pins to pin the sides to make it more fitting, and tucked the fabric at the top of the hole that opens on your sides, into my bra band. It fits better, though I could get it altered, at least I hope. And for me, since I've got more muscle mass than fat mass, and I'm already a low weight, the sleeves are baggy on me. Overall, I think it's a good bodysuit, it's soft, just be aware that wearing a bra, and pinning the sides, you're bra may be shown through the hole in the chest area(probably will show regardless). It is a flattering bodysuit, and I enjoy it a lot. 4/5 because I should've gotten the xs :,)",
Samantha,Very comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FMY2H8FSVFBF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8TRPJ2X,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 2, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I should've ordered my true size. I've had a lot of bodysuits run smaller than they should, so I ordered one size up but it is a little more loose than I'd like. But that's on me. Design is comfy and nice.",

Chollsy2.0,This is super cute and fits very well!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AS9LSYKHD4SI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8TRPJ2X,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 15, 2024",,,"This was super sexy and form fitting, it fits very well. The only issue I have found with this is there is no bra I have, not even one of the sticky strapless bras works with this. They all show through the cutouts. Other than that the fabric is nice and durable. It isn't see through and the separated sleeves finish off the look perfectly! One of my favorite bodysuits now!!",
M.a.S.e,Awesome,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6KXR8VYP9IG4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8TRPJ2X,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 25, 2024",,,This outfit is lovely and sexy. The material is thick enough that you can wear it without a bra. It sits on the body in a way that shows a perfect amount of skin. It is stretchy and can be worn in and out of the bedroom.,

Nick Ware,So cool! Perfect for cosplay events.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5KEJH3JYW3FJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8TRPJ2X,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 8, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,,"At 5’3” and 105 pounds, I chose the small size, and this bodysuit fit me like a second skin – it couldn't have been more ideal. The fabric is incredibly breathable, guaranteeing that you stay cool and comfortable all day long.

At 5’5"" and a curvy 145, I was worried about how it might fit, but this piece is a dream. It accentuates all my best assets, hides those little love handles, and gives my hips the spotlight they deserve. Wearing it, I seriously feel like I could step on stage with Rihanna – that’s how confidence-boosting it is!It’s not only stunning but also super comfortable. Perfect for hitting the clubs, dressing up for Halloween, or any time you’re feeling like turning heads.",
Katie W.,Great as a top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXF3OCF8AEEVX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8TRPJ2X,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 2, 2024",,,"Great as a nighttime piece. Really nicely made, fits great. Basically just a swimsuit with some cutouts. Really like it and worked great as a rave outfit, as advertised. Little thin, so pasties are your friend, unless you are going for the see through look.  Recommended.",
