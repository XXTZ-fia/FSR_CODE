Also you have to pay the postage to send back. I did not mail back because it cost $ 16 thats as much as shirt cost. I find it interesting that it would of cost me $16 to send back as well as I paid $5 something for shipping to me . The post office said that the address that I printed out to send back was odd it was from China and they have had a few people bring packages to send back with similar a address its like its on long word with about 75 letters and numbers  So for now on I am being very careful where I order from just in case I should have to send back.,
