Let me just say, this jacket is the perfect mix of edgy, cool, and functional, basically, it’s him in clothing form. From the detachable sleeves to the oversized fit, it screams “I own the night,” which is exactly the vibe he brings to his sets ;)  The Japanese Kanji design? Absolutely iconic. It adds that touch of mystery and flair that makes him look like he’s stepped out of a futuristic movie. And the heavy-duty fabric? Perfect for those late-night outdoor gigs. Plus, the hoodie is big enough to keep him warm but still looks super stylish, no floppy, awkward hoodie moments here.  Watching him wear this jacket at his sets is a whole mood. It’s like his music and the jacket were made to vibe together, and I can’t stop swooning (or bragging). If you want your partner to look like they’re about to save the world and drop the sickest beat of the year, this jacket is it. 10/10, highly recommend for him, and for me because wow!",

The lower sleaves and cowl hood are detachable, should you desire to. The hood, while light weight, also has a very rigid and sturdy sort of stitness to it. This way it lays almost in the fashion of the grim reapers hood and doesn't droop or drape down. 9 out of 10 for me. This thing is dope",

Stitching looks great the material is that of a light spring jacket this is not a winter coat but seems like it would hold the warmth in very well with a sweat shirt underneath. Good length on body and arms. Zippers function properly and it looks very cool. Only problem I had is they sent the wrong size. With this being American made Japanese streetwear the issue of things being too short for the American consumer does not seem to be a problem. I did my research and knew this was an American company so I only ordered you one size to be able to have a hoodie worn underneath it, but received two sizes up instead which is far too big. That is not to say anything against Niepce they made a great looking and perfect quality product, Amazon just sent the wrong size. They did address it immediately and made it right with me so no bad energy towards Amazon either. But I do have to now wait for my funds to be returned so I can reorder the proper size directly from Niepce. It was meant to be a birthday gift so it will have to be a belated gift now.. but again Amazon is working with me to correct the issue. If you're wondering about ordering this jacket.. I say go for it, it's very nice and accidents happen. I doubt they're intentionally sending out the wrong size. For a 6'3"" guy at about 165lbs and I think the Large will fit perfectly.",

I ride a motorcycle as my everyday transport and this pullover keeps me warmer than the average to thick zipper hoodie. This pullover is a great addition to any wardrobe and can just be fashionably for cooler early spring and fall seasons. I have to add that as a typica zipper hoodie person, I like the 3quarter zipper/button style giving it a more breathable function when needed and the material doesn't make the horrible windbreaker sound like I'm wearing a trash bag. I would definitely recommend this jacket to anyone looking for style, function and quality at a great price.",

Something about using zippers for circular sleeves isn't quite conducive to quick removal. Periodically i managed to nearly snatch the hood off as its held with a few buttons, it held up at a concert i recently went to though and was reasonably comfortable to wear. As a windbreaker, it is not thick and hot. It is currently winter in my state and I'm seeing temps in and below the 30s. The lowest i wore this windbreaker comfortably was the high 30s and i was a little cold after extended time outside. The graphic on the sleeve seems to be of good quality and has not started to peel or anything after about 1 week. The size i ordered(XL) was pretty dead on, i initially worried whether it would be a bit small on me but when it arrived i was satisfied to see that it fit perfectly. The hood can be a little ackward to wear, the best way I've found is with the two buckles fastened instead of just lying flat on my shoulders, where its more prone to get snatched off.",

I like the idea of the detatchable hood. Although ive noticed it sits kinda funny in the neck/collar part. The straps are more for show as they are stitched together, takes a tiny bit of adjusting but its o.k. also, as a person who does alot of stitching myself, its not really an issue. Quick simple easy fix. The hood iss way bigger than i thought it to be, definately good for raining weather, though ristricting view a little bit bevause of the depth of the hood, but, again, not really an issue.
