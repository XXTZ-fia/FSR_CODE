Aside from that this is a typical hoodie thickness, it is not thin which would be more for spring and summer. It could keep you warm but it depends on how warm you need it, and if you layer up with a puffer vest or not. The black acid wash looks like it's a worn and used look like you've owned it for a while. I like that style very much and knew that this would have that look before I ordered it.
