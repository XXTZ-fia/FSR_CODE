Ash,They run very small.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26IHI9HEXMR3S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8KP8MPG,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Yellow,Verified Purchase,The quality of the pants is great. However I'm a size 16/18 and the XXL didn't even come close to fitting.,
Me,DURABLE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14RPALBWC8EIJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8KP8MPG,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Yellow,,"Very durable jeans. Baggy look, but fit well in the waist. No complaints, very comfortable to wear and deep pockets.",
Audra Castro,Not cut for curvy figures,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7FTPE8Y05RWM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8KP8MPG,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Yellow,,"I love the style and color of these cargo jeans.  They have tons of open flap pockets without looking overly bulky. The fit is just okay.  They were definitely not cut for curvy figures.  I wear an 8-10 in women's jeans and ordered the XL per the size chart.  Wish I would have ordered the 2XL as these fit weird across the hips.  They have these 2 darts at the waistline that kind of pull at the pockets.  Other than that, I love the rest of the fit and may still wear them with a longer shirt that kind of covers up the weird fit at the top.  They are made of a really thick denim that doesn't have any real stretch to them.",
Connie C.,Honestly a great purchase. Make sure you check the sizing!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30X1F9NG4C0EX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8KP8MPG,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Yellow,,"I generally wear a large size, but these were big on me. I am 5'3"", 130 lbs., and I would say I had to keep pulling up my pants if I didn't have a belt. I ended up tightening the waist myself, but I'm sure a belt would've helped fine (I just don't like wearing belts). The legs are also a bit long, but if you're going for the scrunched up look (or are more than 5'5""), that would be fine.  The quality of the pants are actually really good! They are comfy right on the first wear, and the pockets are all functional and not just decorative! The ""yellow"" color would work well with multiple aesthetics, and look true to color from the online photo. If you're going for the y2k or grunge look, this would def work.",
Cats on Mars,I love these pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWCZGU80VWGPW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8KP8MPG,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 28, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Yellow,,"These are great! I'm thin and short and it is hard to find pants that fit my waist but are baggy how I like them to be. These fit both of those criteria. The only thing I would warn anyone about is that upon the first wash, the yellow dye they used leached out and made some of my clothing that had white on them yellowish. It wasn't a big deal for me, but make sure to wash these only with dark clothing on the first wash. I did not notice any color leaching on subsequent washes.",
Steph,So Comfortable!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11PVYELBP8V6V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8KP8MPG,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 9, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Yellow,,Fits true to size amazing color and so comfortable. A closet favorite!,
Customer Review,These Pants Are Much Cuter In Person,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26P0QHTCQKHEX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8KP8MPG,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 30, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Yellow,,"Upon seeing these jeans the first time, I felt that the style of the pants themselves was super cute, but I didn't think that I was going to like the yellow tint on the pants. In fact, I had already emailed the seller asking for them to trade for the black. The yellow tint isn't really visible. In fact, it's closer to regular blue jeans. The pockets and the flare leg bottoms are the real show stopper. The medium pants are close to a size 8, but I think I want to lose a few more pounds before I wear them. I'm definitely purchasing the black version of these pants as a reward.",
Josh,Daughter LOVES these!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2B7EMJSWUXFY6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8KP8MPG,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 28, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Yellow,,"My daughter is thrilled with these jeans! They are excellent quality! They are a thicker jean material that is more on the heavy side. She said that the zipper works great and she loves how many pockets it has. I was very pleased with how they fit her. She is on the taller side and very thin, so sometimes we have trouble finding jeans that are long enough for her when they fit her in width. These were perfect!",
Colleen McG,Comfortable Cargos,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ILXUZ7CQS947/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8KP8MPG,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 19, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Yellow,,"I really like the fit of these cargo jeans. Very loose roomy legs. The color is very unique, very worn in looking. These were very comfortable for me and I don’t usually find jeans comfortable.",
