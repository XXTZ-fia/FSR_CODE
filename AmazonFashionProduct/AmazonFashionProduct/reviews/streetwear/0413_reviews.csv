jeanine ferguson,Honest (and lengthy) Review after 4 Purchases,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R233HY9T4HENAR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BBGB1CLG,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I have never written a review on anything, but I get so many compliments on these pants, so I wanted to share this honest review!  These are my all-time favorite pants I’ve ever owned EVER!!!!! I’ve bought 4 pairs and always get asked about them. I wear them literally every day in college, to class, walking around downtown, even on nights out in bars. They are so functional, with 8 pockets, but don’t give you the “pockets are full” look.  The first two pairs I bought (in white and in black, both size medium) were perfect, and true to size. Zippers are good, pants aren’t see-through, material isn’t too thin nor thick. Very comfortable.  For reference, I’m 5’6” & 125-135 pounds. I wear a belt with them, but you can also go belt-less and let it hang like a low-rise. Belt is my style because I like baggy clothes. The bigger sizes are excessively longer in length so they drag for me.  Note: These shrink in the dryer so watch out… I started air drying.  Here’s why I gave these perfect pants 4 stars:  The third pair I purchased months later (because the others shrunk) was also size medium and black. But it was SO MUCH BAGGIER than the other pair. It fit probably like an XL would. On top of that, it had a really strong (really bad) smell.  I washed it a few times (lowkey 5 or 6 times) with vinegar in cold water (you can also soak it in vinegar or baking soda for an extended period of time) but DONT put the pants in the dryer if they still smell! That will lock the smell in (which will require more washes).  And don’t put them in wash with other clothes if they smell! If you do, your other clothes will smell until they get washed again.  I made all these mistakes lol.  Once the smell is out, your other clothes can start washing and drying like normal, with other clothes. Again though, I recommend avoiding the dryer for these pants.  The fourth pair was so much better… no smell, true to size, but had a bloody bandaid in them.  I’m not saying these pants are perfect… there are some SERIOUS quality control issues here. But the pants are still so worth it!  I seriously can’t rave enough about them, if it weren’t for the 3rd pair I got, these would be 5 stars.  Even with the smell and size discrepancy, I would still buy these pants again.",

So definitely recommend ordering what size you think would fit you best and not going off of reviews saying size up. ALSO, unfortunately these are not for my shorter girls. There is a lot of extra length on the bottom that I would have to get personally altered and that’s not my intent when buying jeans so I am retuning these but they’re not a bad buy when it comes to the jeans as is!",
