Size runs slightly small I'd say, so if you are on the upper side of your size probably just order up 1.  The pockets aren't great, very small and kind of pull the shorts ""taut"" if you put your hands in them for example. If you are using these as running shorts you may need to be careful about what you carry in the pockets for this reason.  Material is definitely on the pretty thin side of things but that's probably fine for most uses.  I took off 1 star for the pockets not being deep enough and not very well integrated in the fit design I took .5 star off for material thin-ness And .5 star off for size running a bit small because on these shorts it makes an abnormally big difference for fit comfortability.  They look undeniably great though which is the best thing I can say about these.",3
