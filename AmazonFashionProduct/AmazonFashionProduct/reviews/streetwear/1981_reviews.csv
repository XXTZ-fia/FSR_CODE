lauren,Feels like it should be over $100,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MGLMBVJ72V7C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1CP2LDY,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2024",Color: #01blackSize: X-Small,Verified Purchase,My daughter asked for this and I expected a cheap shirt but was so surprised it’s a great heavy weight y shirt very over sized but so cute,
Ria,Sizes will fit MOST!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VWMG2B4ZMRJG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1CP2LDY,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 22, 2024",Color: #01blackSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I was apprehensive purchasing this shirt, despite wanting it for a few months, due to the largest size being an XL. Typically I fit an XL in more fitted tops but go for XXL or 2XL when I want a looser or more relaxed fit in. Reading the reviews, the shirt is a thick material with some structure, and tops like that tend to not have much stretch. With this shirt, all of that is true. However, when they say “oversized” they actually mean it. This shirt (ordered in an XL) fits more like an XXL or a smaller 2XL, and because of that, I definitely think you can purchase this shirt if you wear a size/size and a half bigger than the biggest size (XL). The fit is a little strange, as others also have mentioned, because I believe the shirt is supposed to be “men’s sizing” but unisex. Where it fit me tighter was my stomach (apron belly) and my hips which are sort of wider as I have an hourglass shape, but baggy on my chest and arms. I think with some wear it will stretch a little more, but if you’re a bit heavier like me (~270lbs) just be wary! I’m about 5’5 and it’s also long, goes to about my crotch, and if you’re shorter you could wear it as a dress! Don’t mind the length because I’m going to tuck it/crop it. Super thick material, definitely not see through. Sleeves are a little on the long side and come down to my elbow. All in all a very high quality garment, so I feel the $40 price point is justified. Look out for coupons- I was able to apply a 10% or 15% off coupon! My first purchase from the brand and it won’t be the last. I hope Aelfric Eden expands their size range to at least a 3XL to be more size inclusive!",
