Madi,Not like the picture,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM80NIQF35SFA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D868L4GL,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"For $28 I don’t expect insane quality but I do expect that the pants would be thicker than a sheet of paper, which is not the case. They are a viscose and polyester blend that looks and feels cheap. The waist fit perfectly and they are comfortable, however the legs are abnormally wide and make everything look awkward. I’m 20 so currently fashion trends aren’t lost on me but these are just not it.",
