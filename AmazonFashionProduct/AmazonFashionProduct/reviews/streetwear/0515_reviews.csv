Elentiya,Pills Easily. Size Up.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R850U74Q85Y3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLV7BKYJ,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Army Green,,Lightweight. Inside of hoodie is soft but the outside is more poly than cotton and pilled after twice wearing and one washing. Disappointed because it wasn’t cheap. My daughter usually wears a junior size small and we bought her the XL in this. It is oversized like she likes it but not by much.,4
Laura Faulk,"Soft fabric, runs a little small",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8HZPZT4YOC2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLV7BKYJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 30, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Army Green,Verified Purchase,"Got this as a gift for my daughter. Her usual size is a medium but she likes to wear her clothes oversized so I got an XL since there were no previous reviews for me to determine how the sizing was. (Clothing from Asian markets tends to run small). I’m really glad I sized up because the XL is just *barely* oversized in the way that she likes.  I was nervous that the fabric would be cheap or stiff but that is not the case. It is super soft and appears to be of good quality. The zipper seems to be a good quality as well, and overall the hoodie seems durable. The stitching is good and seems like it will hold up well in the wash. My daughter absolutely loves the slightly distressed look of the stars and how soft the fabric feels. She really loved it and was excited to wear it right away.",
