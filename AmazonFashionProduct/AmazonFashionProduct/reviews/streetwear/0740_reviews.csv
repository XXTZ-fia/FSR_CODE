Elijah J.,Fashionable But Expensive for the Quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EW29B5A0QHTT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCY9R4DC,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 4, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,,These pants are quite fashionable and fit well. I got them in X-large larger considering I do not like a skinny fit. I'm 5'10' 170lbs and the XL size fits me well and remains loose in the legs. These jeans are very comfortable and I like the look quiet a bit. My main complaint is the cost. $44.99 is quite a bit for a pair of jeans. And while these fit well and look nice the fabric itself is very thing compared to regular jeans. So you're paying more for fashion than you are quality/durability. As of 10/4/23 there is an additional 20% off coupon available making these closer to $35 dollars so that helps. But really I think this should just be priced at most around $29.99 considering I can buy jeans just as thin as this at Wal**** for only $19.99. Overall I can recommend these but it's going to be up to the  individual if the price is worth paying.,2

The ones we received are a little more ""manicured"". The main issue with him is that the jeans are NOT a slim fit, but more like a relaxed boot cut, so he would have to wear them differently than he first imagined.
