Francesco Panico,Size not True to Fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21YURZHOHKWGV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 30, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,Not true to size fit. An XL is actually a LG in size.,
Ben,Mad disappointing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FFPC2FT2300M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 28, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I’m pretty tall and lanky, granted, but like typically an XL anything will fit perfectly. However, I decided to embrace the oversized aspect and I went with a XXL option when ordering this hoodie. Fast forward a few days, and the hoodie fits like something between a small and medium. Not to mention the fabric is ridiculously thin, I’m talking like thinner than one of those blank t shirts you get in a pack from Walmart. It did come with a cool necklace though that seems to be decent ish quality, so that’s what saved it from a one star review.",
Lily Haas,Material is terrible,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ2CX7T0F70AL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"I put this on my Christmas wishlist and received it this year, it’s not a loose comfy hoodie! Size guides are off and it’s not cotton as pictured. Also there’s no pocket on the front as pictured. Poor quality and I’m sad I had someone buy this for me.",
Mikael Parrott,Way too small!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VC0D5JIKWJ5T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 17, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,I’m admittedly a big person but I’m usually fine in XXL. This was at best a small and the feeling of the material was very low quality. The style wasn’t very accurate to the picture at all.,
sandra darrough,Bad,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X8K4RRND37ZF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 18, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,It looked like a Halloween costume,
KRG,Sizing is way off,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R262CR4ZUKSD6M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 18, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,Returned because the sizing was completely wrong. The person I got it for would ordinarily wear a size XL but likes things oversized so I ordered up a size. Not even close. The fabric was thin and insubstantial as well. Disappointing.,
Brayden,The sleeves came with fraying,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36BL6P09AC2RI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 6, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"The hoodie fits well, the texture is a bit strange, and is a lot thinner than I expected. I love how it looks, and it’s very cute! However, when I opened the package and put it on, I instantly noticed that there was a LOT of fraying on the sleeve. The area around the buttons mostly was were it was all at. I easily trimmed them off, but it was still a little frustrating. Also, my other main problem is, if the pants you’re wearing has no pockets, you better have a bag on you.",
Virginia Hewitt,Oversized,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1URZ644LB329X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 2, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"The Hoodia is supposed to be oversized, I bought a xl for my child and it was so small it wouldn't fit a 7 year old. And my child is a very small built child.",
Evan,Predictably far too small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16U407972M90L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"1.0 "," the United States "," July 14, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"Look, I'm not a giant, I'm 6'3"".  200lbs.  Maybe we need more standardized sizing or possible regional sizing but I ordered a 5x, knowing it'd be smaller than normal, and it still fits like a tight tshirt.  It's specifically supposed to be baggy in the first place and the sleeves don't even come to my wrist.",3
Michele A Cemini,As expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZP1TTRFFUBPN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 13, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,Granddaughter was very excited to receive this. Runs small but nicely made.,
Lee Ward,Actually polyester not fully cotton,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36P2EQWXAKR4D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 28, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I really like this product, when I received it I got two necklaces that came with it, not sure why but thanks. Black with gray/white flannel hoodie very comfy but thin and see through when you point it to a bright object. Good product but I'm 5,3 135 pounds and the XXL size is a large in American sizing for men/women. So it barely fits baggy enough to my liking. Just past my bottom.",3
Placeholder,Perfect fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39FP1HD6KQ078/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 18, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,Perfect fit. Granddaughter loved it. Nice & comfy too. .,

I am super happy with the size and style.,
Whuppzadaisy,More polyester than expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HWDAZWNXWZ0A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"3.0 "," the United States "," February 1, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,I bought for grandson its a Nice shirt but I was expecting more of a cotton or flannel type material  because of the plaid but is a-lot of semi stretchy polyester,
Charles,nothing even close to what you expect,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2A05VYS07MBZT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 28, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,way too small and the material was decently uncomfortable,2
Amazon Customer,Not worth the time or money,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OTTNDZDROING/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I ordered this for my daughter's Christmas gift as she had seen it and put it on her wish list.  It was originally supposed to come a few days after Christmas, which is fine, as I understand everything is moving slow.  However, it kept getting more and more delayed and didn't come for ONE MONTH. when it did get here, it's really an odd fit. the bottom and bottom band are tighter so instead of being baggy everywhere it's tighter on the bottom than at the shoulders. It's really weird material, too.  I offered to send it back but my daughter said she'd deal with it, but I would never order this item again.",6
Jenni Pickett,don't buy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22SVLP59J9ILP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q28FL7Z,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 2, 2022",,,"the material is thinner and bad quality it looks better in photos. Plus, the buttons on the sleeves don't button up. I won't buy from them again",10
