If you are medium get them in small they are a bit too baggy. I kept them because bigger keeps me cooler otherwise I have no complaints. They wash easy they don't seem to fade. And they are good a length.,

Brad,Such cute y2k parachute pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1L9RQOV0IC15X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWHCN5VM,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 1, 2023",,,"These are slippery nylon - almost like real parachute pants, LOL. My wife looks great in them. She is 5’2”, 116lbs, and ordered a small. It fits well. Maybe a bit long, but if she cinches in the parachute ties at the bottom, they work great. The draping gives them almost have an anime feel. Really fun. My wife is thrilled with the functional pockets as well. These should be washed inside out on delicate and line dried.",2
Elsie,"Surprisingly, they fit really well!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2M81S7D3EWO6W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWHCN5VM,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 14, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"I actually really like these pants.  I sized down because they’re baggy and I don’t regret it.  I’m a thick build and these look surprisingly nice on me. Price wise, it’s good for what you get.  I actually don’t think these look cheap, I actually like the material because it doesn’t attract much lint. Simple design so they don’t look tacky.  They don’t stretch, but they have an elastic waistband which makes them look edgy and helps cinch the waist.  You can also the bottom leg area, perfect for pairing with nice tennis shoes.  I recommend pairing with a y2k tight top.",2
Amazon Customer,Oversized pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2B6T21ZVFL3GX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWHCN5VM,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 7, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,,These are not actual cargo pants. They are imitation cargo pants. The material is super thin. I actually really like that they are thin because they are perfect for working out. Once I put them on I was relieved. They looked huge when I got them out of the package but they are actually supposed to fit baggy. They have an adjustable strap on the waist so you can tighten or loosen them up. They also have an adjustable strap on the bottom of the pants if you want to tighten them up as well.,
Twinpossible,Comfortable? YES! Breathable? YES! Cheap looking? YES 😞! Gym worthy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZBSYXZASM12G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWHCN5VM,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 31, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Black,,"I was torn here, but decided to round down to 3 stars because they are kind of cheap looking, more so then the photos, and despite the comfort & lightweight material that makes it great for exercise - jogs, cycling, gym, and other activities.. it doesn’t cut the mustard on the aesthetics.  I own a many of these style of pants & love them. In the photos it looks like the white is ‘piping’ like the other pants like these that I own. This is just white seam stitching, which is a big turn off to me. It doesn’t look like it should cost more than $15 at BEST! Some small changes would make these fab. No white seams & piping detail instead, would change this review quite a bit!  These do run a bit large, but that’s ok to me. It’s the Y2K look & it does make the waist look a bit more snatched. That I like. The bungee detail is ok. For the price, I just expect them to look a bit less cheap. Durability must be gauged over time, but they are otherwise fairly comparable to those pairs I purchased at $26.99. I just want MORE for the $!  I’ll wear these to the gym MAYBE & for lounging. That’s about it. I’m 5’6’’, 126-128 lbs., 27 inch waist, 36.5 inch hips, the elastic waist will accommodate many sizes. Size down if you don’t want a SUPER loose fit. I gotta say though, there are better options out there, like the 4 pairs I own here at home. Just wish these were more like them, quality wise. The length is perfect for me with sneakers.  I won’t be purchasing again, but they’re comfortable, yes! They need to be priced lower, or look more upscale then they do 🤷‍♀️. (Detail wise), as the photos deceived me a bit.  3 stars! ⭐️⭐️⭐️  ** I hope my review has been helpful 😊. **",8
Mae T.,"It's the details that make these fashionable track pants fun, but waistline design is a bit weird",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5EYQGIKBZQCE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWHCN5VM,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 30, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"I got these track pants because they looked like nothing I'd seen before, and I like that uniqueness. The outside overstitching on the legs, adjustable drawstrings at the hems and waistline, deep pockets, and  wide legs makes these pants as functional as they are contemporary. However, I do find the design and construction of the waistband a bit strange. The gathered top of the pants that the drawstring is threaded through attaches to a wide piece of elastic that one would expect to find inside the waistband of the pants. This not only adds width at the waistline (which no woman wants), it looks a bit out-of-step with the design of the rest of the pants. It's not a deal-breaker though; I'm still glad I got them, and plan to have fun wearing them this spring/summer.",
Greta Li,Oversized for sure,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4CC84EJZT8AC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWHCN5VM,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 27, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Black,,So this product is pretty accurate when compared to the pictures however I just don’t think it’s all that flattering on me…they’re really oversized that I kind of feel like I’m swimming in them. Even either the right shoes & outfit I still don’t think I’d feel to confident about the fit on me personally. The material is pretty decent however and thick so it’s also very warm. Just not my style I guess lol…,7
A.S.,Looks cheap,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IJNLG7IQQ41V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWHCN5VM,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 24, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"These pants are lightweight and comfortable. My partner has a 32"" waistline and size Large fit her well. The fabric seems pretty durable for how light it is, but the style and design of these pants doesn't work.  The white accent lines on the legs look like you are wearing your pants inside out and seeing the seems, and the drawstrings make it look cheap since they are just cheap plastic cord locks. At the bottom of the pants you have to pull so much cord through to give the gathered look that the giant loops of cord hang out and get hooked around your toes.",
Danielle Beguiled Bookworm,Very Fashionable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4HXB5PFQNXUU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWHCN5VM,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 22, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,,Breathable material verses a windbreaker type. Optionality on leg style too. I like the color break up just enough pop.,
