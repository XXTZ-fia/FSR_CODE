Serumachi,"Great quality overall, product worth considering",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMBB3PET5ZWR3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKL9S8R,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Right out of the package, it didn't seem as baggy as I would've liked it. But after actually trying it on, it actually flared at the bottom which I really liked. The quality of the pants didn't feel cheap, and my only minor critique is that the main pockets aren't that deep, which isn't much of a problem since there are many other pockets that have a decent amount of space. Good product overall!",

Elle,"Extremely low crotch, pant legs are too short",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15YR39KTCH5I7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKL9S8R,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 30, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"The thing that sucked the most about these pants was that they were not how they looked in the image. The crotch was almost down to my knees, and the pant legs are shorter than it seems. They went up right above my ankle. It does say that they are high-waisted pants, but if I pulled them up to where they were supposed to be, the belt line covered my rib cage and the ends on the pants were half-way up my shin. Maybe it was a manufacturing issue, but I'm very sad that they didn't fit correctly. It was a waste of my money sadly. :(",
P. Jordan,Good Purchase,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OWAAESCAAHVA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKL9S8R,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 2, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Purchased this to make a Jeans Skirt for my granddaughter. It made a great pencil width but she wanted more flare so we inset two panels of flannel material on the sides. I saw that some people had issues with the smell but we did not have that. Size wise, it seemed true to size. She likes all things oversized so we got her a large and she cinched it with a belt so there was more flare at the hips. Length was long. we took it up 1.5 inches on the bottom after we were done. Fabric is what you would expect for a pair of jeans.  The construction of these is good. We ripped seams and had to put in some time to get them down. The button holes on the pockets are fine. There was a report that they were too small. We did not see that. These pants in all are a good deal and decent quality. I probably could have given them a 5 star rating, they came quickly and were as advertised. I just don't give 5 stars unless the item is outstanding.  I only got one photo but hope she will send me a couple of more with her actually wearing the skirt. Of course, a grandma can't have too many pictures of her g-kids!",2

D Kelin,Grunge look + Grunge Smell,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RASEHA3OYYC8I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKL9S8R,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 20, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,First let me just say that the pants fit perfectly and look exactly like the photos hence the second star in my review. Unfortunately the snaps on the straps are unreliable with frequent detaching and worst of all is an acrid chemical smell that I cannot seem to wash out. I would have returned them had I realized that my efforts to remove the skunks odor would have had no results. Others here seem to have had better experiences with these admitted very attractive looking pants so buyer beware.,

SarahBeth Carter,Love the Look and Great Fit - Zipper’s a Bit Tough,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFASN742AAMN7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKL9S8R,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 9, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,This pair of utilitarian distressed black jeans are fantastic. They have an extra wide leg paired with a high waist (that actually fits really well). the waist and hips are snug and flattering and the wider leg look is paired with big pockets and extra added details and snaps that I think add a lot of fun. The only problem I’ve had with them is that the zipper is a bit touchy. I may get it replaced just so I never end up out and about wearing them when it decides to stop working.,
Silas M,10/10 Pants For sure,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OGDP0R5YKERS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKL9S8R,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 8, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"The pants are amazingly baggy, and the XL size fit perfectly, with the ideal amount of baggy-ness (I usually wear 34 waist x32 length pants). They say high waisted, but in my opinion, they definitely look better NOT high waisted. But anyway, my only “complaint” would be those little denim strips that are shown to kind of hang in the pictures, yeah I’m pretty sure my package was missing some of them, because otherwise I couldn’t figure out what I was supposed to be doing with them. But they definitely don’t look bad without them!! And MY GOD, There are 12 Pockets. So THAT makes up for it 100x over in my opinion, anyway; 10/10 pants for sure!",

Also, the it’s kinda Lon on the bottom bc the hemming on pants would go under my shoe but that’s fine since I know how to sew, I could probably do a distressed bottom style! It’s nice overall but a bit tight on the waist.",

I ordered a size up and am so glad I did because there is no stretch and I have big thighs. They look quite nice but if you sensitive to texture I would not recommend these unless you wear tights under them because they do feel uncomfortable when your legs move.,

They are heavy and warm, the pockets and straps do make them a bit more bulky. I saw someone recommend to size up, I bought a size Medium when I am usually a Small and I’m mixed on the fit. They are baggy on all areas, I have to belt it very tightly onto my waist. I think if I were to have gotten my actual size they would’ve had some flattering tightness on the thighs and behind, but the super baggy look is also sick. I’m 5’2 and these are super long, no way I can wear flats with these. The smell out of the box is also horrible. I ran it through the wash with odor removing detergent and it still smells. I ran it through the dryer with scented dryer sheets, still smells bad. It’s like the smell of burning plastic mixed with sulfur and expired milk. I’m not sure how long it’ll take it get that smell out. As some other buyers mentioned, the holes for the buttons are not cut out. You will have to get scissors or a knife to slice open the holes yourself in order to have the pockets actually clasp. All of the product images have the pockets functional, have the process of cutting them out frays the fabric. It makes it harder to use the buttons at all. For $40 I was at least expecting to have functional pockets. Overall I like do like these. I have trouble buying pants and was hesitant to get these, but I don’t regret it even with the weird quirks. They are a fun style, I like the pockets, I think the color is nice and the fabric is decent.",5
Chiteki Kitsune,terrible!!! Nonfunctional!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O8K61UIAFWH3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKL9S8R,"1.0 "," the United States "," June 9, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Warning these pants look great in the display picture and even seem to somehow fit the model in the photos however, they are very deceiving. The material is very thin. The waist seems to almost be sized correctly, but there are tight spots in the construction, such as in the crotch and in the knees, I wouldn’t want to be embarrassed in public by having my pants, tear it either the knees or the crotch.. Possible, embarrassing Possibility is that the let’s call them straps on the sides are simple Button snaps that clip onto the pants I would not trust them to stay there for long, especially in a setting like a movie theater, where the potential strap gets caught. I cannot recommend these for anyone for any reason I think they could have done better for the price. Nothing about these pants is worth the $37 that they charge buyer beware..",4
