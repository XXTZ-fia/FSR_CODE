I'm an XL usually, being 6'2"" and 185lbs. Most things fit me as expected with that size, but this was noticeably not as baggy on me.  I washed the hoodie as I would wash my other clothes, and it shrank a bit in the wash. It still fits, but now it is definitely on the smaller side now, especially in the sleeves. My advice is: if you don't want to hand it down to your wife/gf/kids, order a size up.",

The lining is the lighter style and not fuzzy or too bulky. (see photo) The fabric makes it move with you easily and doesn't leave you feeling overly stuffed in. It's interesting that when looking at sizing, it's recommended to order up in size. I think that it should have been recommended to order true to size. When I ordered up, it was a little too slouchy-though the whole point is that it is called ""oversized.""  The color is as shown, but the ""distressed look"" might be a little contrived. That said, I don't think people who look at it would necessarily notice that it is produced and not just worn in. I think this will last a good long time and be one of those hoodies we reach for when looking for casual comfort.",
AMGP,"Great, with one exception",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30QRROKV7RMDD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CDQ99PVD,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: A-black,,"“Bobeutou Oversized Hoodie Men Vintage Cotton Casual Hooded Sweatshirt Trendy Baggy Basic Hoodies Retro Pullover Streetwear”  My first impression of this hoodie is that it looks exactly like the acid washed jeans that I used to wear a few decades ago, and although it has the same look, it’s far more comfortable.  This hoodie is very well-made, and it has excellent stitching throughout. The 100% cotton material is a medium weight that stretches comfortably. In fact, the material has more of a jersey feel to it rather than a typical sweatshirt that has fleece on the inside.  Since this hoodie doesn’t have fleece on the inside, I find it to be much more versatile. I can easily wear it indoors without getting overheated.  I like the ribbed cuffs and the ribbing to gather the sweatshirt just below your waist. I also like that the hood does not have a drawstring – I find those drawstrings to be annoying, and not really practical for a pull over hoodie.  I am a 6’ 3” 260 pound weightlifter, and I normally wear a size XXL top. This hoodie in size XXL fits me great – with one exception.  I wish the sleeves were an inch or two longer. The photos of the hoodie with the model wearing it are how the sleeves should fit. The model must have very short arms.  I really like this hoodie, but I have to take off one star for the shorter sleeves.",

It is exactly what I would have expected if it had been sitting in a vacuum sealed bag since 1988.  So the look and sizing are spot on.  Unfortunately, I forgot how much softer the interior of these types of items have gotten over the last couple of decades.  The inside of this one is slightly scratchy / less soft than you would expect for this type of item.  So overall I like the look and the size.  It isn't uncomfortable, but I wish they had enhanced the interior liner comfort a bit for back in the day!",
