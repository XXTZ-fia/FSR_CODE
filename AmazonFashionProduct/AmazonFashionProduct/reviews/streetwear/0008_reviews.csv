Emily Taargüs,Super soft and cozy y2k coded hoodie jacket,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHI7X0U87V5VK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8DN4X5R,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 15, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,,"I just moved to a cooler area of the US so I am revamping my wardrobe for the incoming cooler season, which is why I decided to order this super y2k coded zip up hoodie. I have always liked zip up hoodies so you have the option if you aren't super cold to just leave the front open for some ventilation. Also, zip up hoodies are nice if you don't want to mess up your hair, so I appreciate that it has a zipper, first off. Secondly, I really like the design of this sweater, as someone who was in highschool in the y2k era and graduated in 2003, this sweater is right up my alley from my old emo days. Thirdly, this sweater has exceeded my expectations when it comes to quality, it's a nice thick sweatshirt material with the soft inside fabric that feels nice against my skin. It seems like nice durable thick material that should hold up well through washings and dryings, but if my initial assessment here is incorrect, I will update my review. At the current price of about $30, I think this is a good value since it seems decently well made, thick, and soft. Overall, I really like this hoodie, the design is cool, it's a good value, and it's soft and cozy, so I definitely recommend it to others.",

This hoodie is super cute, and I love the heart spiderweb design. The hot pink really pops, too. This has exceeded my expectations on every level. I own a lot of summer items that are Y2K because they capture my favorite aesthetic perfectly, and their stuff looks very authentic to the era. But this is my first fall item and I'm in love! The material is nice and soft, and it's a good weight for layering. I'm thrilled with this hoodie, definitely recommend it!",
