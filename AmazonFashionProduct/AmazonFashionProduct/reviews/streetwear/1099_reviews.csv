I'm 5'5, around 165 lbs and thick around the middle and thighs.  I probably will try size medium if I order more. These wash without too many wrinkles, feel soft and fit well. The cargo pockets are real and I appreciate that in these essentially ""fashion"" pants. I mostly wear them for my active, sometimes dusty, customer facing job. My only complaint is that I've marred the look of the fabric in a couple places. I tried to use regular hand soap to pretreat a mark from pen ink. The grey color of the fabric started to lighten, as though the dye wasn't completely fixed.  I stopped scrubbing and just let the stain and mark slowly blend and fade with more washing.  Luckily a small stain won't be a big deal, but unfortunately I predict these pants will enter the ""too warn looking for work"" phase sooner than my less stylish but tougher Dickies cargo pants. Still, I like the look and feel of these a lot and will probably replace this pair when they wear out and/or buy more colors.",

I was hoping with the elastic waist, it would work out as some others with this elastic waistband style were comfy for me. Unfortunately, these pants were too tight at the waist to be comfortable.

I thought my zipper had slipped down, but when I looked, I realized that the zipper actually came apart.  As you can see from the picture, the one side somehow pulled out of the mechanism, rendering the pants useless.  Because of the length of time (one month), I am unable to return.
