Maria,It’s the same as it looks on the picture but size runs very small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31H20B5LH9RX4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C2MPXCG4,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 8, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"It says it oversized but it really isn’t if your a bit bigger, I usually wear an XL or 1X depending on how big I want it, I got this shirt in a XXL seeing a review saying it runs smaller but it’s still not oversized it’s just a regular shirt. I’m not a big girl per se but I do have a big chest and it is a little tight on that part. So my bigger girlies I would suggest to keep looking, anyone that wears a size L or below just go a size up it should be just a little oversized for yall",
