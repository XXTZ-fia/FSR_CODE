Ms. CiCi,Top was too small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RJWD7B9Y7LID/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1KQH9JX,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 31, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,"I usually wear a large. I really like the set, but keep in mind that if you have bigger arms, you might want to size up to an XL. The pants fit really well and make your butt look amazing, but the top was tight on the arms and I barely got it on.  I did notice that you could buy the top and bottoms separately as well so I will just purchase an XL top.  Other than that, I love the material. It's comfortable and stretchy. Again, I suggest buying the top and bottom separately.",
