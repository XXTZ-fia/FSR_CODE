Rush Coil,"A low-cost, wearable Raf Simons adjacent hoodie",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24J54VCEVLVDV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B5MZHSKT,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: B,Verified Purchase,"I'm giving this 5 to balance the reviews because people don't seem to understand what this hoodie is going for. It is clearly a take on Raf Simons. I have a few authentic Raf Simons pieces but his patch pieces are now easily thousands.  It is cheap and the material is cheap and the printing is cheap. But for $40, you're getting a style that is rare.  This hoodie is an odd material, like a cheap blanket with a very cheap zipper. But again, the point is something you can add to a high/low fit as filler or a layer. It fits true to size in my opinion. It isn't oversized for a man but for a woman, it would be.  The material is surprisingly soft and warm despite being thin.  The construction in general isn't great. But here again is why I'm giving 5 stars: you can pay $40 for some cheap hoodie, or you can get this one which is pretty cool.  If they made an $80 version using a better blank I would pay that, but this one I can throw around and destroy.",
Avid Water Bottle Enjoyer,Very nice 👍,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XJ3CA9XGSWX1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B5MZHSKT,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: B,Verified Purchase,"It's extremely comfortable on the inside, and it's pretty thick, so it keeps me warm. My only problem is that the sizes run a bit small, so just be wary of that. I got a large, and it just fits, so it's not really that baggy. I recommend getting it a few sizes bigger. For me, it doesn't really shrink in the washer. I use an agitator and tap cold water settings.",

The patches are not the same as the product photos but they're roughly the same vibe. None of them make any sense though haha. The colors of the patches were extremely bright white even though  they are supposed to be yellowish so I fixed that by tea staining. The patch on the sleeve (of which I think is kind of ugly), however, cannot be tea stained as it is more of a iron on material. The patches do not fray at the edges like it shows and they're this weird vinyl-like material, making it very difficult to fray it yourself. It has metal aglets as well.
