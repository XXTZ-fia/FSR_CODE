The style is so cool and looks even better in person! I ordered a medium size although my usual size is a large. But the reviews insisted on sizing down as it seems to run quite large. They were not wrong about that lol! The hoodie is way bigger than I thought which I'm happy about since I feared it wouldn’t fit me as a curvy girl, so size down if you want cause it does fit pretty big! The hoodie quality is great and thick, it feels warm on my body and is very soft but not too soft. Very glad to finally own a real Aelfric Eden hoodie! Highly recommend!!",
