The Average Comsumer,Versatile and comfortable shirt with few flaws,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UFE7GC7D0DF7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDY5F24D,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Color: Black OnyxSize: Small,,"This shirt is lightweight, breathable, and works well for casual and semi-casual settings. The fit was decent, though slightly loose around the middle, making it better tucked in. The fabric is soft and wrinkle-prone but doesn’t feel cheap. While the stitching appears solid, some creases from packaging were tough to remove. It’s versatile and stylish, though a pocket or better sizing would be welcome. Still, great value!",

The shirt is made well, with quality seeming and button holes.  The material, despite being described as 'linen',  is polyester and viscose, so it is a bit thicker than linen expectations, but is still good quality.  It washed up well, with little to no wrinkling that needed ironing/steaming.  I got the 2x, which sometimes is too tight through the shoulders on me, but this one was reasonable.  The rest of the size of the 2x shirt was sized as stated and comfortable.  The 'medieval blue' was a great color, being light grey and navy blue mix.  Overall very happy with the quality and fit of this shirt, and can recommend it.",
