Avery,Skulls are barely visible,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSUCCL0Y4CKQH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD3XJN1R,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: Carbon BlackSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"Doesn’t really look like the picture at all. The red is way too vibrant and the skulls are black for whatever reason with white splotches on some parts? Even the teeth look really odd like there’s two pairs of teeth on the top jaw. The zipper was also really crappy. However, it fit well and it was warm enough, so I don’t suppose I’ll fool with returning it.",

Mariel,"So Cute, My Teen kidnapped It!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HE08NQ3HCAVS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD3XJN1R,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 8, 2024",Color: Charcoal BlackSize: Large,,"Okay, so this Meiweileya Women's Y2K Grunge Skull Graphic Zip-Up Hoodie is so ridiculously cute that my teen has literally taken it over—and, honestly, I’m not mad about it because she absolutely rocks it. It’s like this hoodie has a magnetic pull that’s impossible to resist. One minute, it’s hanging in my closet, and the next, it’s become her go-to item that she wears almost every day. I’m honestly considering just buying a second one for myself because I’m kind of jealous at how effortlessly cool it looks on her.  The Design & Vibe:  First off, the Charcoal Black color is perfection. It’s that deep, dark shade that somehow manages to be both edgy and versatile. And the skull graphic on the back? So awesome! It has that cool Y2K grunge vibe that’s totally in right now—think emo, goth, and a hint of rebellious spirit. The skull is bold without being over-the-top, and the skeleton details make it just edgy enough for my teen to feel like she’s making a statement, but it’s not too much where I feel like I need to intervene. It’s the perfect balance of cute and cool, with just the right amount of goth influence that feels fun and fashionable.  Comfort & Fit:  The Large fits my teen perfectly, and I’m sure it would work for other sizes as well—it’s got that relaxed, oversized fit that gives it a comfy, laid-back look while still being flattering. It’s not too loose or too tight, just the right amount of slouchy cool. The fabric is soft and cozy, which is a huge plus because she wears it constantly. Whether she’s lounging around the house or going out with friends, this hoodie is always in the rotation. Plus, it’s a zip-up, so it’s easy to adjust how much warmth she wants—perfect for Oregon weather where you never know if it’s going to be chilly or slightly warmer.  Versatility:  What’s really impressive is how versatile this hoodie is. It pairs effortlessly with jeans, leggings, or even skirts for a more fashion-forward look. My teen has been wearing it with high-waisted jeans and chunky sneakers for that edgy, street-style vibe. It’s one of those pieces that works for a variety of moods and outfits. One day, she’ll wear it with all-black everything for a sleek, goth-inspired look, and the next, she’ll add some colorful accessories to lighten it up a bit.  The Final Verdict:  Honestly, I can’t even be mad that my teen has hijacked this hoodie. It looks so good on her that I’m low-key considering getting one for myself because it’s just that cute. The Meiweileya Y2K Grunge Skull Hoodie is the perfect mix of style, comfort, and attitude, and I’m so glad we found it. If you’re looking for a hoodie that adds some edge to your wardrobe without being too over the top, this is it. My teen wears it almost every day, and I can see why—it's easy to style, super comfy, and just cool. If you’ve got a teen in your life (or you’re just looking for something fun and unique for yourself), this hoodie is an absolute must-have! 💀🖤",8
