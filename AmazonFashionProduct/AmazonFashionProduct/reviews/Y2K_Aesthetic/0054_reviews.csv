R. Gollaher,Beware of color- Not as pictured,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RMB8O10C9QWN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDRW65PG,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 27, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Coffee 1,Verified Purchase,"Item color is NOT as pictured. The item color I picked was ""Coffee"". When you look at the picture it looks like brown with beige. It is actually brown with pink. My daughter picked this out without looking at the reviews. Others said the same thing and attached pictures. She decided to keep it, but really is not happy. She would of for sure preferred beige as in the picture. See pictures that others have attached to their review. That is the true colors.",
Mary S,Very cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19BPV0Q4FRQN4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDRW65PG,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Brown 2,Verified Purchase,I really like this shirt its very comfortable and cute. It's thin but where I live its hot most of the year so it's okay. For me with the V neck I have to wear a tank top under neath but I'm also very flat so it might just be me. The sleaves fit perfect I have long arms so it's hard to find shirts that go all the way down. Overall it's very cute and comfortable to ware I would recommended buying.,
Adri Allen,Color is completely different,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZCPF7QJ4AHEM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDRW65PG,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Coffee 1,Verified Purchase,"I like how it looks on me but the color is completely different from the photo in the cover, it’s more of a darker brown and pinkish white than a white and lighter brown in the photo. Also it’s incredibly itchy sometimes. I wouldn’t recommend getting it if you have sensitive skin.",
Rella Loveyou,differently colored?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9SI2YTQ9S68V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDRW65PG,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Brown 2,,everything about the sweater is the same aside from the lighter stripes being entirely pink instead of a lighter brown? kinda weird but still cute,
Chastidie Earnhardt,Waste of Money,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CJHDD5RYBRY6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDRW65PG,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 2, 2025",,,"This shirt was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my daughter. She absolutely LOVES the one pictured with the hot pink/magenta-ish stripes, which appears to be a sweater. But what we actually received looks NOTHING LIKE what is advertised, as it’s red and baby pink, looks like a strawberry shortcake shirt or something, and feels like a cheap Halloween costume. And she absolutely HATES it and will not even try to wear it, so can’t speak to size, fit, or warmth. I had picked the advertised shirt as it’s her exact style and colors and the price was good. What we actually got though makes me feel like I’m dealing with wish.com all over again. I wouldn’t waste my money.",

Brad B.

Catherine,"Great Material, Inaccurate Color/Fit",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQRWYR6QIN36L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDRW65PG,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 7, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Coffee 1,Verified Purchase,"First off, I really hope the company is able to make more sizes of this and versions true to the description photos. I bought the v-neck sweater in cream/brown. Color of product is actually pink/brown. Instead of going to the waist (per photo), sweater ends at ribcage under bust (essentially a crop top); this might work for someone with a very short torso or if you want a crop top look. The sweater material itself is really soft and feels durable. Very little stretch in fabric; most sweaters I’ve tried as a busty person I have to size down a little to fit both waist and bust. This one has no give, so definitely go by the size chart. The thick v-neck itself looks super pretty with my figure, so I’m particularly sad to return it and hope to find something with a similar neckline.",

I love that it has a minimalistic aesthetic, but it’s still cute. It’s also more form fitting, which I like in my clothes. I if you have a medium to large sized bust (34b-34d and above) it will be a bit revealing. But it’s still a 5/5 for me!",2
