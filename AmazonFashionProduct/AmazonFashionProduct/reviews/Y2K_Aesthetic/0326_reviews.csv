It’s very then and the buttons are poorly sewn on and are too big for the button holes so it’s hard to close up. The worst part is that the strawberry’s are glued on (which I didn’t know) so when I washed it every single strawberry came off and now I have to sew them on. Not worth the price :(,

After I put this cardigan on, my love for cottage core has only grown. This cardigan is clearly handmade in the best way because it warms you up like a blanket is very stylish! I would recommend this cardigan to anyone who has a similar obsession for strawberries and the softer side of life. The buttons are a little heavy but they stay attached and adorable! Definitely be mindful of how you're washing this cardigan. I suggest washing it by hand or on gentle in the machine with cold water and dry on low to medium heat.",54
