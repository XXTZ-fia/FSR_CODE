This purse is one of my daughter's favorites, it holds just enough items, but I have to remind her to be careful as the bag is a little flimsy. The side pouches will not hold much and there is potential any items in them will fall out. The main compartment can hold a couple larger items like a phone or wallet. The patches seem to be on pretty good and haven't fallen off. The purse overall is very cute and practical, it's definitely a giftable item.",

The material is nice, but the shoulder strap seems a bit on the flimsy side. In the overall, it does give the impression of not being that sturdy, and I would definitely not overstuff as I have the feeling that it may break. The design is simple and comes with a little plush cat keychain. It has a couple of compartments inside and three outside pockets. Good for lightweight use.",

The size of this bag and the number of pockets seemed perfect. Plus the bag is very cute and I love the color.  Unfortunately, the whole thing is just tiny. It feels more like someone took a nice messenger bag and shark it down to toy size and child’s quality. The pockets would be of no use to me on an airplane; the belting used to close the pockets are so loose that everything would likely slide out when placed under the seat. The water bottle carrier is too small for a standard (narrow) water bottle.  I do like the bag and will be passing it on to a young person in my life. Sadly though, this is not a useful bag for an adult woman.",6

The messenger bag is well made with nylon material on the outside and a waterproof material lining the inside of the bag.  It is very light weight with a nice shoulder strap that can be used as a crossbody bag or shoulder bag.  It has 2 zippers that work perfectly and several pockets both inside and outside that can used for a multitude of things.  A cute little doll is included with the bag and can be used to hook onto the bag or wherever you choose.  This is the perfect bag for a preteen or teen girl due it's light weight and size.,

The material is a cross between Nylon and Canvas. I felt like the Canvas material strap could have easily been swapped for the Nylon consistency. The bag looks well made until you see the canvas style strap. The strap however is adjustable. There are some organization and I did get the cat keychain with the bag. The bag arrived in a plastic Ziplock style and when you take it out the strap is inside the bag. on the one side with the bag was the included Cat charm that is in the photos.  Why I rated this as a 4 star, Although, the bag looks and feels durable. The Strap is a different material and made me think of lower quality. The bag is spacious enough where it can work for Adults/Teens and kids who want a messenger bag style. It can hold a light Everyday Carry Kit. I've had concerns about the strap breaking if packed heavy and it's something I don't want to risk. This bag is not ITA (""It Hurts!"") Pin/merch bag. I wouldn't risk trying to set this bag as a decorative piece to show off your fandom to a character or series. But, it will work for basic everyday carry. Like your phone, charger, wallet, keys, etc.",
