Das Design hat mir auf den Fotos zugesagt, aber in echt ist die Hose viel weniger dunkel wodurch die aussieht als wäre sie seit 10 Jahren nicht gewaschen worden und das Design dadrauf sieht aus wie mit einem Edding draufgemalt, aber alles legitim. Das könnte ja noch so gewollt sein, aber dass bei der Hose die bei mir angekommen ist nichtmal das Loch für den Knopf am Bund ausgeschnitten ist ist ja ein kompletter Reinfall. Dazu kommt noch, dass die Hose mir trotz dem elastischen Bund komplett garnicht passt. Sonst passt mir M gut, aber bei der Hose passt es nicht ansatzweise. Insgesamt 0/10. Würde ich nicht nochmal machen und auch keinem Empfehlen. Und spätestens am reißverschluss kann man erkennen, dass es sich um ein ultra günstig produziertes Produkt handelt, dass so teuer wie möglich verkauft werden will. Qualität wurde hier leider nicht großgeschrieben.",2
