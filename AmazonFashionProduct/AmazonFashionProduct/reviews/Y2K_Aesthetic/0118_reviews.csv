A few issues I've had with other tube tops -The top either falls down (have to keep pulling it back up) OR the bottom keeps rolling up my stomach -Usually they are too thin - if I try to wear nipple petals underneath you can usually see them. -Others have shrunk in the wash and then they basically became bandeau bras.  This tube top has none of those problems. The top has an elastic band to help it stay put and the bottom somehow doesn't roll up. It's also double lined so you can wear any kind of bra underneath and you can't see it. And last, it washes completely fine. It's stretchy, comfortable, cute and doesn't look cheap.  If you're looking for a basic white tube top staple — this is the one. Buy it! For reference, I ordered a size small and I'm 5'2 and 120lbs (wear size 34B in bra)",

It seems to be good quality material and has a nice thick double lining. Style is cute! It’s a little more stretchy than the other one i tried, so if you want support you should size down for sure. If you’re between sizes DEFINITELY size down because if it’s not skin tight the double lining sort of wrinkles up.  There’s no rubber lining, so it’s not as grippy but it also doesn’t create an underarm roll on top the way a lot of tops with the tighter top band do. There are pros and cons to both, it really just depends on what you’re looking for.  I’d recommend if you’re looking for a good tube top with a really good price point!",12
Madison,Stylish and Supportive: Perfect Tube Top for 4th of July,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CR29QMHSXIBI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSFWRRT2,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 9, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Wine Red,Verified Purchase,"I recently wore this red tube top for a 4th of July celebration, and I have to say, it exceeded all my expectations. As someone with a 34F bra size, finding tops that are both flattering and supportive can be a real challenge. However, this tube top checked all the boxes and more.  Firstly, the fit was impeccable. The elastic band at the top provided just the right amount of support without feeling restrictive. I was able to move comfortably throughout the day and didn't have to worry about adjusting or readjusting the top constantly, which is a common issue with strapless tops for those with larger busts. Secondly, the fabric was lightweight and breathable, perfect for a summer day outdoors.  One of the best features of this tube top was its versatility. I didn't need to wear a bra underneath, thanks to its supportive design, which is a rarity for me. It provided enough coverage and lift to feel confident without the need for additional undergarments, which is a huge win in my book.  Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with this tube top. It's stylish, comfortable, and perfectly suited for those with a larger bust size. If you're like me and struggle to find tops that fit well and look great, I highly recommend giving this one a try. It's become a staple in my wardrobe, and I'm already planning to wear it for more summer outings.",10

I didn't want to have to wear a strapless bra because they are so uncomfortable and difficult to wear for any length of time especially when I have a higher placement for my ribs and my upper waist is dramatically different in circumference. I'm always around a size 34D-36D (depending on the brand of bras and shirts) around the mid-chest, but 25-26"" just below the ribs that are too high up for comfortable clothing fit. Overall I'm 5'2"" and 120 lbs. This is a great fit for my body and exactly what I was looking for when I ordered it. I'll get another one in a different color now!

The picture made it look much longer which is why o was comfortable getting a small. Some clothes on here run so big in my experience so for this item I’d say it’s safe to order 1-2x higher.

This is what she thought about it. ""Overall this product is pretty good. The material of the top is very soft and stretchy. It has an elastic on the top so that the top doesn't fall down. I like the color of the top, it's a staple that I'll be wearing for summer. Looks great with a pair of jean shorts or a skirt. My only complaint is that the material isn't super thick, meaning you need to wear something underneath.""",7
