It comes down pretty close to her knee. I do regret not getting a large because of how big it is on her. I think if she wanted more of a fitted look, she would've gotten a medium. Lemme say she is around 5' and is a skinny kid, so don't make the same mistake as me and buy the largest size if your physique is pretty similar. The material was cotton and the graphic has stayed after a couple washes. I certainly will be buying from this seller again.",

Was slightly worried from the other reviews but figured worst comes to worst i send it back to amazon. But omg when it came i was so excited to see it matching exactly. the back really stands out and i am happy overall. I ordered an xl i usually wear small a though it’s very oversized but that’s how i like it. If you’re also usually a small and like oversized i would say get the large for a more “normal” oversized look.  I’m only rating 4 stars because it is a little sheer but it’s not overly thin or anything. i would recommend it very much so other than that :). Hope that helps (also it’s not fitting like a womens top so boys or others feel free to snatch it up its quite “unisex” ),2
