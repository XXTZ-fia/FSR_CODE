Wildfire 460,Product is different than shown,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15P75AY9NOFHB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D449N619,"1.0 "," the United States "," February 24, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Strawberry White,,"The image on this sweater showed ""puffy strawberries"" on it, which I thought I was getting when I purchased this, but I was wrong. They are not puffy, in fact they are sown straight on to the sweater, and poorly done as well. One of the strawberries were falling off of the product, I was very upset about this when I received it. It was also difficult to get In touch with someone to send it back, and it took a while until it was shipped back because of this. The sweater is also overly cropped, and I bought a large. The white color of the sweater is more of a gray as well, and I would generally just recommend buying another sweater like this, but from a different company. The only thing I can't complain about is that the fabric was soft, so that was the only plus.",
