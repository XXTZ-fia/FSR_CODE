Marcia P.,Interesting material.. and more..,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3J2C7AZVY3DEF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4VKDMLV,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"I bought this shirt, and it was WEIRD. Let’s just say that the material was worse than polyester, not sure what it was, but definitely not what it was listed as. The picture is way different than the real product. Also, if you look up close at the picture on this product, it has a hard to see metal charm hanging off the neckline. It is WAY bigger and more noticeable in person. Would not recommend.",
