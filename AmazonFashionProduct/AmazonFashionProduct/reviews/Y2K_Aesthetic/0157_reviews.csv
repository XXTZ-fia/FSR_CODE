Not sure if that is code for NOT SOFT.  NOT flannel.  Just be aware the material is 'sturdier' but the coloring which is what made me think this was of a softer material is deceiving if you are looking for something soft.They are heavier than flannel - therefore I guess more rugged. Just be aware this coloring pattern is NOT indicative of it being flannel material.",
