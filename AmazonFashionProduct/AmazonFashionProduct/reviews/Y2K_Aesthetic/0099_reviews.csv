ash,Cute but lose af,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TZDPY3T6SPUF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D72RYW8V,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 11, 2024",Size: SmallColor: B Black,Verified Purchase,If you want an oversized sweater that’s kinda a dress then great. If you want what’s in the picture then oh boy. It’s very loose around the waist and trying to just used safety pins and ribbons to tighten it not only looks bad but results in so many snags like an unreasonable amount considering the material. To get the look pictured you with need to know how to sew and have the time and at that point you might as well just make it yourself.,

It's got a nice weight to it without it feeling suffocating (which is nice since some of the lighter ones feel like they'd rip with one wrong move). The only issue I had was the neck/shoulder cowling that it shows in the photo. It doesn't stay on your shoulders, but instead wants to roll up around your collarbone. I just bought some fabric tape to keep them in place and it works fine.",
