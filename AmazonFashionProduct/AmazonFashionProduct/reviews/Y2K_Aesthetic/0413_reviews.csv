I washed it once I got it so it can shrink a little and it fit better. The straps on the top are adjustable. The only thing that bothers me is the seam on the top falls weird on your chest. There is a seam that goes under the boob area, but it falls more across the nipple making the fit look a little funny, but it doesn’t take away from how cute it is so I still love it!",13

And the v neck is super far apart so I can’t just pin it tighter in the back because the front part won’t cover everything. Besides that, it’s pretty good quality and I will def be wearing the shorts!",2
