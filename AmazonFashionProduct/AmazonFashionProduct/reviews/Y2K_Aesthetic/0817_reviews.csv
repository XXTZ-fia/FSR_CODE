Miss M,Cute but runs big — Prepare for slow shipping,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZU8E7OPL8J7C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2KN2529,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 4, 2024",Color: S-whiteSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"So, my daughter ordered several items here for part of her back to school wardrobe. For the price point, I wasn’t expecting department store quality, but I admit this particular top had us pleasantly surprised. The fabric and stitching are of decent quality and it looks as advertised. The fit runs big, specifically in the arm/shoulders — and yes, as others have mentioned, it IS transparent (nothing a cute cami underneath won’t fix). The GRIPE: this seller is a drop-shipper and the items are actually coming from China. That is not a problem in of itself, except that isn’t mentioned anywhere within the listing and when checking out, Amazon gives the arrival window of 3-5 days from purchase. That was not the case, and tracking the packages was a hassle, since it gives you a bogus origin scan (Jamaica, NY). I managed to find a Reddit thread with a site you can actually track these misleading tracking scans, which revealed the packages’ actual shipping origin location was China; hence the long delivery time. Just something I would have appreciated a little transparency on. Also, we were charged separate shipping charges for each individual item purchased (3 items = over $21 in shipping alone) — in hindsight that probably should have clued me in, but my daughter really wanted these tops. All in all, she’s keeping 2 of the 3 ordered, as only 1 of them was disappointing and hopefully the return process runs much smoother than the delivery. The packages that arrived all had a NJ return address and the return label I printed off through Amazon has it going to CA … geesh!",

Girlie V.,wouldn’t recommend lol,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUFF42EDMZH4V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2KN2529,"2.0 "," the United States "," July 14, 2024",Color: S-whiteSize: Small,Verified Purchase,I got xs and it ended up being really big especially in the back and the shoulders. I tried fixing it up with stitching to make the shoulder area more fitting as you can see in the photo which is after I fixed it up. The fabric is also really thin so you’d want to wear a tank underneath to cancel it out and what not. Giving it 2 stars cuz it’s still cute but there’s tops in better quality that are just as cute and cheap or even cheaper aha 🙏,5

Blurryface,Whole body of shirt is see through lace,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RHYT83XW4SBP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2KN2529,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 30, 2024",Color: I-whiteSize: Small,,"This isn't a terrible shirt but it isn't great quality either. The Amazon photos looked like it was lined through the torso area but it's entirely see through so be prepared for that.  The lace is ok: decently soft, not scratchy, but not much stretch or suppleness. The size is accurate; it doesn't run inordinately large or undersized. I am wearing a small and have a 33"" chest and 25"" waist. It fits like a standard small.  It's not uncomfortable. It doesn't look bad on. It's cute. Wish it was a tad higher quality but for the current price, it's ok.",7
Sharlene G.,Love the design of this top.  Order your usual size.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZUXMOLEI7ZIA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2KN2529,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2024",Color: S-whiteSize: Medium,,"I ordered the ’S-white’ version with the cap sleeves, ruffles, button front and pin tucking.  This top is made of 95% polyester & 5% spandex but there’s no stretch in the fabric.  It actually feels like light cotton cloth with an embroidered floral eyelet pattern. The construction is good and the stitching is precisely sewn with finished seams.  The buttons are cloth covered so they’re somewhat difficult to get through the button holes.  The bust area is lined providing full coverage.  The sleeves and back neckline have elastic (See photo). This top can be machine washed cold and hung to dry.I’m 5’4” tall, 117 pounds with a 36.5 inch bust and 26.5 inch waist.  I usually wear size small or petite 6.  There wasn’t a size chart for this product so I ordered size medium since the top looked like it may have been designed for juniors.  Unfortunately, it’s too big all over and I should have stuck with small.  My advice is to order your usual size for this topUPDATE 1/27/24I machine washed in warm water and tumble dried this shirt using medium heat.  It shrunk considerably so that size medium fits through the body.  When I wear it with the buttons in the front, it pooches out on the upper back which looks odd.  The shirt fits considerably better with the buttons in the back.  The sleeves are still too long so size small would have been a better choice for me.  Wash in cold water and hang to dry if you want to avoid shrinkage.",17
