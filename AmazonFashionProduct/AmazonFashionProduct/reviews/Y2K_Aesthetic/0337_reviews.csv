But it runs at least two maybe three sizes smaller than indicated. The fabric is nice. The image on the front is not lined up... Its off center.,

FYI,FP dupe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X9PAO5XWRQ5Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D78Z9XDY,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 18, 2024",Color: Pattern GraySize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I have the FP version of this sweater that I love so wanted to try this as a cheaper option. It’s okay. It’s definitely not even close to the same quality. The fabric is more shirt than sweatshirt and the image on the front is a transfer, not screen-printed on. Size up, it runs small. I’ll probably keep and see how it washes but won’t be ordering another.",4

I’m usually a small and got a large, I could see you getting away with a medium too honestly. I will have to post a pic of it later. It’s exactly what I was going for though, I love the cozy feel. The texture/material feels good too",2
