I like the design on the front of it. It is not a racerback tank top and I'm okay with that. I do like the wider straps. If it's me good. It comes to just above my hips. I know the pictures show it as being a crop top but, it is not. What I do like about it most is that even though it's white, it is not a see-through material.",

This shirt goes very well with my green ones that are a slightly deeper shade of the same green, how fortunate!  I would lie this top if it was a little longer, like how it looks on the model. I even ordered a medium, which was not even reaching my navel.  It is a very light knit. I had hoped it would be a bit more substantial. It is still a very nice little top.",

Star stitching puckers all around it, looks warped even when it isn't worn. Sizing is tiny — the crop is VERY short. I ordered a size up from my usual medium and it was still like a small. Fabric is that plasticky ribbed feel and it just looks so sloppy and poor quality. Yuck.",

Material is weird Shein material they use for halter tops that feels rubbery and cheap. Oh, and also came in a bag with a tag from Emmiol 🙄 . It's still kinda cute, but I personally would not wear this more than once after the event I bought it for, even though I planned to. If the material was different, I would. However, it's just not the best quality and definitely wasn't worth the money. at best it should be like $7.",8

Size was a little tight. Fabric is a little thin, which is why I am deducting a star. You might have to wear another tank top underneath to help with the opacity of the fabric, but the top can still work. It's really cute and washes well in the washing machine. I recommend it but it runs small which affects the fabric quality as well.",
