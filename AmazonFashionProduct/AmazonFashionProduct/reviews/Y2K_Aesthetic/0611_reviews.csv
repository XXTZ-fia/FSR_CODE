Elise,SO CUTEEE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FSLM8PQR5I6W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GMN4M1,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Size: MediumColor: #A1-navy Blue,Verified Purchase,"This hoodie is so cute!! It’s thick, but not bulky. It’s still very moveable and creates the perfect baggy look. The quality is really nice and the material is really smooth to the touch. I will say, I wore this out in about 27F weather and I was still cold. (I only wore the hoodie, nothing else.) So it’s not the WARMEST but still decent. I prefer when they aren’t super heavy.  I’m 5’7 and 140lbs, i’m on the slimmer side and in tops I usually wear an x small to medium (depending on the shirt) and I got a medium. The fit was perfect for my body. If you do like it a little extra baggy i’d say get a large. But the medium works beautifully for me!  My only things I noticed that may bug some people is that it didn’t have drawstrings in the hood and the hood itself when it laid on my head almost looked like a elf hood 😂 Those things didn't bother me that much though, but I thought i’d mention it. Overall this is such a great hoodie! i’ll definitely purchase more things from this brand.",
