Raquel,Do not waste your money.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38F1NF7ICE2Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4SQCL6H,"1.0 "," the United States "," June 14, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Never regretted an online purchase more. It’s so cheap for a reason. After waiting weeks for it to arrive, it’s poorly sewn, looks as if part of it was sewn inside out. It’s extremely short and doesn’t cover anything because the shoulder straps are so short leaving cleavage underneath exposed. The lace trim looks as if they didn’t finish sewing it, falling off at the top. Save your money, I thought I was making a good decision by buying from here instead of shein but i should have stuck with shein. So disappointing  :(",
