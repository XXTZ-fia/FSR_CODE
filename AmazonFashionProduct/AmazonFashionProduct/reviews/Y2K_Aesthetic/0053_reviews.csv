Alexus A.

The runching distracts from the midline and emphasizes the top.",
MVL,I really wanted to like this.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZVGFJR2ZTV0A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHRWTGZH,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Color: BlackSize: X-Large,,"This shows every, and I mean every, imperfection that you have.  It clings to it all.  I was a bit worried about that and I even sized up from my normal size large and got an XL.  If you are super slim, this will probably work for you but I'm 57...",

Sync.with.me,It fits true to size and looks cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HR45IBSUA1YC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHRWTGZH,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 23, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Medium,,"It is a random Amazon brand thing, but it fits true to size, and I think it’s cute. I got a size medium and I’m about 150lbs and 5’ 6” so I would recommend just matching whatever size shirt you like the fit of.  The black color is a pretty flat black that appears to match my other flat normal black items. If you get what I mean. There are sometimes different color blacks that do not match the “regular” black. This luckily matches the other black clothing items I have, like my yoga pants from pink.  The fabric is a little bit thin, but that is to be expected. I was not looking for some chunky thick thing, so it’s nice. Would work well paired with some nicer casual pants or a skirt or whatever. Because the top is black, it compliments just about anything else you are wearing.",
K Hancock,Adorable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BNRBMBY9WEU0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHRWTGZH,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 17, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Medium,,This top is very fashionable and cute.  It is made of high quality fabric and fits well.  The off the shoulder part is fun.  The construction of this top is excellent.  It is a good value for the price and very nice.  I love it.,

Mz. D,Attractive design but size up to be safe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IY6N092EAJ8F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHRWTGZH,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 17, 2024",Color: BlackSize: X-Large,,"I really like the ruching on this top. It’s attractive and it makes the sizing pretty forgiving. The ruching provides a very flattering, body hugging effect that's great for camoflauging imperfections. I ordered an xl which is one size larger than my typical size (for reference, I’m just over 6 feet tall and typically wear a size 10/12 or large) and feel like it fits me perfectly. Given how forgiving the ruched fit is, I probably could've ordered my regular size and been fine but I'm glad I erred on the side of caution. While overall I really like this top, I have a few complaints that knocked my rating down from 5 stars to 4. 1) The neckline isn't finished very well and there's a large white itchy tag sewn into the back. Because it isn't finished well, the top seam wants to turn inside out once the garment is on my body, which means this ugly white tag is hanging on the outside of the top in the middle of my back. I cut the tag off but it still left a bit of very visible white tag behind on my black top. To fix it properly I’d have to unpick the seam to remove it completely then restich by hand to repair it. My sewing skills are nonexistent so this idea is a nonstarter for me. 2)  While it's easy to pull the top off the shoulder, keeping it there and making it look attractive requires constant readjustment. I think this top is flattering enough to justify this annoyance. 3) The way the sleeves are made is kind of peculiar. They sort of look like cap sleeves that look a bit funky when worn off the shoulder (as shown in product photos). I'm still quite pleased with this garment and plan to wear it to an upcoming holiday party. My solution to hiding the ugly remnants of white tag without doing any actual sewing was to fold over the top seam to hide the tag then I fixed it in place using a liquid stitch product.",

Recommend ordering 1-2 sizes up. Also the sleeves are way shorter than they look in the photo. They're more like cap sleeves.",
