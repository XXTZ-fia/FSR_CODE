It still fits just real tight on the lace. I do workout so I should have expected that but other than that it's cute adjustable strings so ubcan tighten the stomach lace area.,8

But actually it looks just like the picture, it’s pretty comfy to wear, and the material doesn’t feel cheap it feels normal. You do have to corset the top yourself but I think that’s ok because some people might want it to be looser or tighter. But ORDER A SIZE OR TWO UP. I normally wear smalls in tops (I’m a B cup) , I ended up getting a large, so I can for sure tell it runs small. That’s the only reason I gave 4 stars because the sizing is very limited.",12
