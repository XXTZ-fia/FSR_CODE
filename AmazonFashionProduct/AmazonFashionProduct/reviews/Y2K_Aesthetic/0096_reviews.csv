Melissa,Not accurate description,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35YPWQBMFYM4S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4D67BFP,"1.0 "," the United States "," July 23, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Blue--b,Verified Purchase,Do not bother buying. Looks nothing like the picture and are sizes to fit asian people. The stars are literally stickers that were about half peeled off when I received them. The material isn't jean it's some cloth that is made to look like jeans. And the size is entirely different than us sizes. Don't bother purchasing this item you will be disappointed,

sarah gullion,"Cute, comfy pair of pants",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WTPOUACTFY67/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4D67BFP,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 17, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Blue--b,Verified Purchase,"These are CUTE! I ordered before reading the reviews and some of them had me scared! My daughter is 5’5”, 155lbs and roughly a size 8-10 or a L in women’s. I ordered her the XL and it fits well. They look to be cut like they’re meant to be a bit baggy The waist band is completely different than advertised. It’s a standard mid rise. It’s giving more old school jnko’s and less Christina Aguilara which I’m personally glad for but if you’re looking for a super sexy pant it’s not that. They feel like good quality pants.",

I’m a 12 and the large wouldn’t go halfway up my legs. And are more like the 3rd photo not as seen with the model in that they aren’t at all low rising. I returned and bought another pair and got an Amazon gift card credit after returning them. They came next day but the xxl will go on but too tight around the waist. Would like to see if I could change for one more size up.,

The paint is coming off already, but they are grungy look so we don't mind. I am afraid the zipper won't last too long as it keeps getting stuck, so I'd be happier to get a refund, but that's still not an option and is tying up $30 I'm not too happy about.",10

I recommend to buy them in a size you usually wear. The bottoms of them were long but if you don’t like the bottoms of your pants on the ground then you should tuck them in. The color was also a darker color then the picture so don’t expect them to be a light blue!,4

I'm 5'8 and I have to wear 3 inch platforms with them and they still touch the ground a bit. Over all I think these are my favorite pants I have ever owned and fit great besides how long they are!,2
