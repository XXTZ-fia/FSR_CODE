Luka,love it!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FSX0UZ1CP53I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D66F148L,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: Style-2,Verified Purchase,"i was a little wary, but i’m super glad i gave it a chance. it’s small enough that it’s not too bulky but also big enough to fit my essentials. it’s super cute and perfectly my style. it also feels pretty well made and durable in my opinion. my only very small issue is that the attachable strap is just slightly too short to be a crossbody, but this could be easily modified and is also not a huge deal. overall, totally worth the money and i highly recommend!!",
