Stevie,Cute but misleading,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34GBIF2AAR5ZU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYL536MV,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,These are cute but doesnt have as much pink as the picture and they are straight big legs all the way down - they don't flare like the picture. My daughter is a size 12 (or large /xl) and ordered a xlarge in these jeans and couldn't even get them above her knees. Very misleading in size.,
Katie Kyo,Extremely disappointed,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2P0SU1N84YR6A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYL536MV,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 24, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,"Not remotely the same as the picture. The jeans are just a really wide straight leg with a wide bum and too long crotch; it fits oddly on both a tall thin teen with no hips and a shorter curvy teen, so it has nothing to do with shape of the wearer - it’s just badly cut. The pink is barely across each butterfly, and so faded it looks more like someone spilled juice than it was an intentional coloring; it’s less than 1/10 as bright as the listong. My youngest daughter was really excited for this; I’m so glad I decided to open it before giving it to her first.",2
Joy,Barely a bell botton,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGHCMK95EH1BB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYL536MV,"1.0 "," the United States "," November 9, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,I’m so bummed! These are BARELY wide at the bottom and the pink is very washed out. I really wanted them to look like the photo- giving super jnco late 90’s wide legged vibes.,3
Ashlynn,Not what you expect,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I0ZEZZ02MFPH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYL536MV,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 7, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,"They have pink on the butt, there baggier then expected too idk not that well.",
Gurl DON’T do it.,NOT true to size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38ULMPUQ01KOK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYL536MV,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 3, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,"I gave it two starts because the pants are in fact FIRE, they look so cool, however, I bought an XL, bro ain't no way bro. An XL was basically a size 6 pant size maybe, if I am being generous. They are also true jeans so they aren't stretchy at all. Great design, won't fit anyone with hips or a behind of any magnitude. I am 5""3 and I wear a size 10-12. Hope this helps anyone thinking they can pull off an XL of these pants, trust me ya can't.",9

I definitely recommend for your teen.",3
