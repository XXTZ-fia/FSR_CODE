Forty Spice,Adorable when styled properly,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QW0CP8Q4W48Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DQY4FFWQ,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 23, 2024",,,"The graphic and fit were as pictured, but I should have been cautious with the polyester material. It feels like kid's pajamas, with a bit of sheen. It's also not the burnout style fabric.  As with many oversized tees, you either have to be tall so that it doesn't become snug at the hips, or prepare to tuck appropriately. Cute print but not for super hot weather. Decent value for the price.",
