Bushman,It Girl!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XE4UML6BZH19/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2DBS7XY,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 16, 2024",Size: MediumColor: A003-white,,"This shirt had a great fit and was very comfortable to wear around the house and when going out. I got many compliments on the simplicity and chic of this shirt. The disco design came out really aesthetic and nice which also made it easy to pair with other outfits. The material is light and not too thick, making it a great summer staple in my closet! I did think the shirt would be more tight fit, but the product actually came a little looser, so I'm thankful for that! Overall, I liked the aesthetic of this shirt and the feel, especially in this hot, hot summer!",

It arrived quickly and mine was shipped in the bag (heads up if this is sent along as a gift). No damage: rips, tears, skipped stitches, etc.  So if you know baby (doll) tees, they are designed to be cropped and slim. In the chart provided sizing, I accounted for this by ordering the largest size. It PARTIALLY worked 😂 The piece was relaxed everywhere EXCEPT my bust.  The shirt itself feels soft, but thin (tad see through as it’s white) and the graphic is thickly placed on — only time will tell if it’ll peel. However, the graphic is sharp in its printing.  I wish the fit were BETTER, but I’m ok with it.",
J I,"Okay quality t-shirt, sized bigger than a baby tee, material will pill",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EL19ZB1N5IPA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2DBS7XY,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 2, 2024",Size: SmallColor: A003-white,,"The tshirt is alright -- soft, the print is done well, and it fits a small size well (US 4-6). It is not cut like a baby tee, significantly looser, but still reasonable for a ""small"" size t-shirt. The material is synthetic and the type to pill after use and washing. Wearable and cute, but medium quality product. The printed part on the front has a chemical smell that I hope will air out, but is currently father unpleasant.",
