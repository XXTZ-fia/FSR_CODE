I’m a DD, so i’m sure this top is perfect for smaller chests. but if you’re anything bigger than a C cup, do NOT trust this top. any small jump, or bend at the hip, WILL make the girls fall out.",7

Detailed review: This is an excellent tank top to add to your ""cute summer top"" collection. The ruching is great. The lace detail is pretty and sturdy. The sides extend far enough to cover the little fat folds under your armpits. The back dips low enough to give a little ""sexy"" element and I like that the back ties so you can adjust it. Great length, not too long, not too short. Works well for a small bust.  If I could change one thing: I feel like the lace part ends a little high up, I can also see my strapless bra through the lace at the point of the V- but that might just be me feeling paranoid and wouldn't be something anyone else would notice.",2
Kaelyn Wells,I absolutely love this top accept for two things.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R9IYT3TN269D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4XN236Q,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 22, 2024",Size: LargeColor: A Black,Verified Purchase,"I love this top a lot actually. It’s comfortable and looks really aesthetically pleasing. And it’s a very light fabric so it doesn’t feel too hot. I got a large because of the size chart and I’m glad I did because a medium would’ve been too tight. But it’s also a little stretchy so I guess it depends. But the size chart is accurate, or at least it was for me. The only things though is that the lace fabric of the top is a little bit off. I noticed that little fibers of the fabric were rubbing off on my skin and under my nails and it just got everywhere. Not a deal breaker just mildly annoying. The other thing is that the chest area might feel a little dangerous for those with a bigger chest. I personally had to make sure nothing would fall out. But I will say, nothing ever came close, I just wanted to be ahead of it. But besides those two minor things. I really would recommend this top.",2
