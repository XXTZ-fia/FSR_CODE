David Roman-Nichols,"Unfortunately didn't keep in the end,",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUMVTO9WUVGBF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B097KZ56HH,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 3, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"The quality of the fabric is amazing, even my daughter with sensory issues loved it. It fit nicely, although we would have needed to switch to a smaller size for her smaller sister if we'd kept it. However the print was extremely disappointing, not only does it not look like the ad post since the shading is none existing. I knew it would be pixilated as shown on the ad image, but seriously none of the detail. Additionally, it is an iron on decal! To make things worse it is a very thick iron on decal, so the fabric under the decal feels like you laid a tarp on a shirt and melted it on to it.",
