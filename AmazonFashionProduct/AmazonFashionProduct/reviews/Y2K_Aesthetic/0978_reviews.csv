Sarah,"Cute, frilly, unique top!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16DPAAGA9JJ1L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3Q7VBCW,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 13, 2024",Color: PinkMaterial Type: Polyester,,"This is an adorable addition to my wardrobe. The lace is soft and comfortable, not scratchy like some other lace pieces, and the quality is surprisingly good for the price. The bow detail at the front is well-made and adds a sweet touch that enhances the unique, kawaii goth aesthetic. I love how it mixes Y2K vibes with a grunge twist, making it perfect for going out or layering over a simple tank. It’s lightweight, great for summer evenings, and adds a standout look to any outfit. If you’re into a playful, edgy yet cute style, this top is a must-have.",
