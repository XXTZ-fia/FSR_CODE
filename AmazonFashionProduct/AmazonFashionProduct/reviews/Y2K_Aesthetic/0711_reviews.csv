Amazonreviewer2,Perfect size and super cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OHW74W2GQM2F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9YHNSNC,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 3, 2024",Color: White,,"For some reason I thought this was going to be a smaller backpack. I knew it wasn’t like a purse size but I wasn’t expecting something my daughter would be able to carry to school if she wanted to (she’s in junior high). I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was plenty big enough to hold her laptop and several of her school books. She had really wanted the black one but I accidentally got her the white/cream one. Once it arrived she fell in love with it and she was glad that I got it instead of the black. She uses it as an overnight bag and it also works great to carry her extra stuff in for cheer like her shoes and practice uniform. It is really well made and has lots of little spaces for pens and pencils, calculator, etc. I would definitely buy it again!",
