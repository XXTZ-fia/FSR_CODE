Waited more than 2 weeks for this lightweight jacket to be delivered. If it was as nice, warm, and pretty as it looks I'd recommend it but it's not.  Absolutely do not suggest this ugly, coarse, cheaply made ""coat.""",

Ara,Neat Jacket,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ATYJMGYDNNBF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHQR4B5Z,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 2, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,"Physically, the jacket itself does not appear cheap, however, you can definitely feel the cheapness on the non softer side. But that’s not an issue for me, It kept me fairly warm on a windy spring day in CA. To me, it looks really cute, I haven’t washed it yet so Im unsure of how it’ll hold up, but I’ll update if it falls apart after one wash. The sleeves can be adjusted (tightness) same for the bottom, so that’s real neat. Pretty cute overall.",22

It said it was bad quality and runs small. It’s the opposite. It is very good quality and runs oversized! I got a medium and I’m 5,6 130 pounds and it is big on. It is literally the most adorable jacket I’ve ever owned! I will post pictures in a couple days. My only criticism is that the packaging was not good. It was thin and it got a hole in it on its travels. I wish it was in stronger packaging. But the jacket was fine. It’s also very warm and comfortable. I wish I could have it in every color!",25
