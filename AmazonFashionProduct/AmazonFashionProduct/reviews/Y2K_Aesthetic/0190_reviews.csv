For reference, I'm currently a size small or medium in tops, size 40-31-41 (bust-waist-hip), 34DD, 5'3"" and about 153 right now.  As far as sizing and fit, I would say these are sorta true to size, but they also fit weird. While the large technically fit me, I think I could have done a medium as well. My main issue was that the stiffness of the material caused the shoulders to look pointy. I tried to adjust them to see if I could fix it, but as you move it just goes right back. Due to that, I would say stick with your true size, as going up a size like I did may be what's causing the shoulders to look like that.  The material isn't what I expected. It's a little thick and stiff, but it is soft. It feels very sporty but I don't think it would breathe very well. The little cinching on the side does help it hug the waist to give a bit of shape, but because I got a size bigger, it didn't do much for me. I also didn't like that the sizing information on the inside is down at the bottom of the shirt instead of on the usual spot that sits on the back of the neck, and you can see it.  Personally, I returned these because I just didn't love them, but I don't think they're bad, just not for me. I was sad because the white one with flowers is adorable. Oh well!",
