Shunie Kryskalla,Great Belt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4L027XZL93ET/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BW88Y83K,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 23, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"I recently purchased this belt and it looks exactly like the photos provided! The material is  fine and sturdy enough. However, the belt buckle is oddly shaped so pulling out the belt from the buckle can be a struggle at times. I’m sure with long use, the constant scraping of the belt to the buckle may cause some wear and tear. Overall, a fine belt that’s very y2k-esque.",
