R. Khan,not very cute and not comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KRM1WTW1NLS7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBL6MMMM,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2025",Color: OrangeSize: Small,,I do not like the look of this top it is not cute and the material is super itchy. the top is irregularly short and does not fit right on my body. i hate the scrunches on the sides of the top they ride up making the top just look weird from the sides.,

Frankey,Way too big,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LCYFH6XMWGNF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBL6MMMM,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 27, 2024",Color: Sky BlueSize: Small,,This is so cute but way to big on my small frame. I have to pin it in the back if I want to wear it. Definitely order a size down. Wish they had an XS or even XXS. Material feels nice and the length is nice but bust and overall fit is just too big.,
