The material doesnt feel like it breaths and when I run my hands over it, the texture feels very artificial. The positive is it is a fun shirt and fast fashion. The downside is that I didn't feel like the top breathed.",

Cautionary Tales,Looks exactly like the photo,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VOKJ5RI1LQ3Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHGQ3XW3,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2024",Color: Navy BlueSize: Small,,"I ordered this when I realized veterinary Lee everything I have is close fitting. I wanted a more forgiving shirt I could lounge around in that felt cozy and oversized. Even so, I was worried it would be enormous, and I size down to a small. I'm 5'9"" tall, 158 and a boyish muscular build. The small was plenty large for me, even in the sleeves where nothing usually fits. It's still a generous cut without actually swimming in it. I virtually never wear small up top, so take that for what it's worth.  Now, it's meant to be deconstructed in appearance and I get that. But while the construction is meant to look careless, it errs to the side of actually *being* careless. The stars, for instance, which are some kind of poly ultra suede material, are not stitched on at the edges, but inside the perimeter by far, which I suspect will cause them to start frying and maybe even detaching overtime. All the stitching is careless and crooked and there are plenty of extra threads. Again, the look wants you to believe this is intentional, but I am guessing this shirt will not outlive the end of winter, and I can't really get behind such blatantly disposable quality. anymore.",3
Susan Stanton,Unusual top but super trendy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RO59DVHUXS3UG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHGQ3XW3,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 29, 2024",Color: Navy BlueSize: Small,,"This top is made of a suede-like cotton and is nicely oversized. I got this in a medium and it fits with just the right amount of bagginess. Looks like something you'd find in Japan, and that alone has me loving it. The stars and the hem/neckline are raw, but this material does not fray, so even after multiple washes it looks good as new, with no need to even iron it. It's lightweight but not flimsy. If you like Japanese street-style clothing, you will love this top. Definitely NOT a sweatshirt, however.",

I ordered the ""navy blue"" and it is more of a black washed out color with embroidery blue suede star patches and a contrasting army green hem. This is an oversized top - I ordered the size S and it runs wider than expected. I also would not call this a ""sweatshirt"" as described since it is more of a lightweight top with a soft, suede-like feel.",2
