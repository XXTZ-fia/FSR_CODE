It does fit well and feels very good quality. It is a bit stretchy and double lined so you don’t have to wear a bra (but I still did).  The only thing is the little band that goes over the boob area is too small for my boobs (with a bra on) but just barely too small. I bought this for a Halloween costume photoshoot (Mia Mignonette Thermapolis Renaldi, Princess of Genovia) so it wasn’t a huge deal. I definitely was able to fit in the small but I wasn’t sure if I should have gone with the medium or small, so that’s my fault. Without a bra on, the band fits perfectly over the boob. I think it a great value for the quality you get. It is flattering! Overall, highly recommend.",
