SMILE,"Bold, Edgy, and Unapologetically Y2K",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM5AL03Y0GNCZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGG75R8X,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Large,,"Red star trims and straps add a bold, punk-inspired vibe to the pants, while the high-waisted and wide-leg cut channel casual, effortlessly cool vintage Y2K style. The zipper detail adds a utilitarian touch that complements the cargo pants structure, which gives the piece both style and functionality. The mix of gothic and grunge elements is what really sets them apart. Adjustable straps allow you to slightly adjust the fit, which is a nice touch for customization. The material might feel a little stiff initially. Not ideal for those who prefer subtle or understated fashion.",
CMB,Large is a US Girls/Kids Size 14 - Very Small Sizing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EG2TM4LMKYY3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGG75R8X,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Large,,"I will start off by saying that these pants are super cute and my 10-year-old daughter and niece think they are just awesome. Unfortunately, I purchased these in the large size for my daughter to wear to her drum concerts and they were just too small. She couldn't get the waistband button to connect right by her belly button. My daughter is a girls/kids size 16 in pants typically so I figured a large in these should fit. I was wrong. They actually fit her cousin, who is a girls/kids size 14 with a narrow/slim build. So Large in this brand is a US Girls/Kids size 14! There is also not much wiggle room on her cousin in the waistband. For such a narrow waistband, the jeans have a large hip curve and plenty of room in the hip area. I'm not sure who these pants are cut for as the waistband is so small with no stretch and then the hips flare out. The denim used to make these feels nice and all the straps and zippers look good. Unfortunately, the sizing and cut of the pant for the tiny waistband just seems odd/off. I can't recommend these because it would be very difficult to find the correct size.",
