I also like the the under sleeve goes all the up to the shoulder and isn’t just sewn to the striped sleeve, so props to that.

The placement of the shoulder seams are way too broad and slump down to my biceps, so the shoulder sleeve STARTS midway down my arm for some reason. The collar is higher and tighter than I expected. I hoped it would show a least a LITTLE of my neck and collarbone, but no. Then the black shirt part is too small, so it doesn't look wide and bottom heavy like the photo does. The actual shirt length is what I wanted, but the sleeves are just so odd looking. It doesn't look like, cute oversized and ariana grande style sleeves, they're just kinda frumpy and odd. IDK. It's not the worst thing ever, the quality itself seems passable and it's comfortable, lightweight, and soft.

I know measurements and figured that, surely, it's a typo, and they're not marketing a North American large as double XL. They are and it is, in fact, in the ballpark of a large by most manufacturers standards. If you're heavy set, or tall like me, then it's baggy in the sleeves but regular shirt size elsewhere. It is comfortable though, so if you don't fall outside of normal sizing then it's a nice regular shirt for the price. But unless you're tiny, then don't expect a torso to shirt ratio like you see in the pictures. I intend on letting the shoulders out as much as I can and converting it to a crop top.",13
