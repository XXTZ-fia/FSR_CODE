When I put this shirt on, it just went over my size A breast. Not even close to being a crop top. In my defense, the photo makes it look more like it should be a mid-driff top. I also was not expecting to have to wear a tank top under it. It is extremely shear to the point of why bothering wearing anything at all.  I am returning the top and instead of risking the next one being the same way in size, I am asking for a refund.",
