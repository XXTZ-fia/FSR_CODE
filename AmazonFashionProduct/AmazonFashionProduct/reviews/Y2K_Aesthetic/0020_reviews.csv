I bought it for a possible contender to make myself a clown costume. I wanted to wear it with the ties in the back.

The sleeves were a nice length and the shoulders were puffier than I thought they’d be, but it was cute overall. I didn’t really like where the waist sat, it was cute but I’d prefer it to be a bit higher. The shirt is made out of cotton but it was sort of thick, it hid my black bra well. Overall it’s a really cute shirt and I’d possibly consider keeping it but I usually only wear dresses and the color black so getting used to a white shirt would be a big thing for me!
