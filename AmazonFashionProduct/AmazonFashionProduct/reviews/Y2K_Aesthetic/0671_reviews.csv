Olivia,So stylish and soft!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XS8K1MKW8CPA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9NRBP11,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 9, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,I accidentally ordered a large and was going to return it but I tried it on and like how it fit loose. It’s really soft and the colors are just like the photos. It seems pretty fitted so if I got my normal size (small) it wouldn’t be baggy/loose. Washed it and it didn’t shrink either. I think it’s high quality for the price and worth getting!,

I just ordered a new one in one size bigger and what came was disappointing. It took almost a full month to get here and is was the wrong color. I got a medium, but it fits the same way my old one fits. My old one is a size small. I haven’t stretched it out because I don’t wear it often and I washed it only about 3-4 times. Unless they stretch out easily but I don’t think that’s the case.",2

It’s very comfortable, stretchy, and it looks exactly like the photos! I also love that it’s not too cropped so it still reaches down to my jeans, and it’s not too thick so you can wear it year round. Just be sure to look at the sizing chart because I’m normally a small, but I had to order a large because of the measurements.",
