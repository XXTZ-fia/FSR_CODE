The print is vibrant and it fits really nicely. It’s a shorter cut which I like because I’m short, so it stops above my hips. This size is great because it’s a little more fitted around the chest and arms which I like (if your arms are bigger consider sizing up!). I imagine with some wear this will stretch. I’ve paired this with the shorts from another Amazon set - it basically goes with everything! Big fan!",2

I’m not a big crop top lover but figured it could be combined with high waisted pieces. I ordered my usual size and it fit well. It was a bit fitted rather than loose like I assumed. It was a bit tight around my chest so if you have a larger bust I would probably recommend sizing up. The length isn’t too short. I ended up spraying it with water and stretching it a bit to make it a little looser. The design on it is super cute too. It’s printed onto the shirt too so when stretched it doesn’t get all cracked and weird. Overall really cute!,2

The material is stretchy and lightweight but not cheap. It fits true to size in my opinion. Very cute and comfy!",4

It is a crop top so it's meant to be on the shorter side and it is somewhat form-fitting. I ordered the largest size possible and it is quite small. It does have a lot of stretch to it though and is not binding. The graphics are very pretty and colorful. I like how light weight and breathable it is perfect for the hotter weather.,

It doesn’t. It is a cute shirt but sizing up doesn’t help the length, unfortunately. I will probably end up giving this shirt to my daughter who is a more of an age to wear cropped shirts. It has a lot of stretch to it, the print is clear. The print is not a thick plastic patch, it is in the fabric, which is nice. I would recommend this shirt, but know that it doesn’t cover the tummy.",3
