lizzie,size down and smells even after multiple washes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18933RPRGW1KJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49NZY7T,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 27, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"These looked so much in the photo like pants I loved when i was a teenager, so when they came i was sad to find they were pretty big for the size i ordered. But I figured hey wash them and wear a belt right?  i' have washed these pants 6 times and not even a tiny bit of shrinkage. Then there was and still is the smell! They smell like straight cat pee. I have washed them with everything I can think of to get rid of that smell but they are just as potent as they came. so I've basically stopped wearing them until i can figure out how to get rid of the god-awful smell. they are very long but otherwise pretty cute, but the smell is a deal breaker for me.",
