Genesis H.,Some is smaller than it appears,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REOSK43QHYAQW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BM69Z3WK,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 17, 2024",,Verified Purchase,I think the necklaces are cute one problem is after prolonged wear if you have sister to skin it could cause an irritation or rash! I developed a rash after a little bit! I did put clear nail polish on it so won't tarnish that quick! The angel is smaller than I thought it would be but other than that for the value of the money is okay! The quality is okay just be careful for people with sensitive skin! I wish that it could have been stainless steel!,
Jade,Great for looks not so great for quality!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18494O8UXXCUP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BM69Z3WK,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 20, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I love every single one of these necklaces, my only complaint is that the quality is very poor but if you only care about looks and not durability while being on a tight budget then this will definitely work for you! I like to wear edgy clothing on the daily so these work well to achieve that style. I can also see these working out for Halloween costumes too so that's an added bonus.",
starlas,you get what you pay for,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Q8Q0IJBZ6PL7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BM69Z3WK,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 31, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"these are by no means amazing quality, but for the price you get them for, they’re really good, and the angel/heart choker necklace is genuinely really good quality, plus you get 1 extra chain that’s also really good quality, i recommend putting clear nail polish on them just to prevent rust/decaying. overall 5/5",2
ryan p.,good for the price and quantity,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LAW8BJTOOUSI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BM69Z3WK,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 1, 2023",,Verified Purchase,they’re really cute and what i was looking for. i imagine they may tarnish so i might put some clear nail polish on top of the charms. they’re exactly what i was looking for. they’re cheap but pretty good quality and quantity for what you’re paying,
