It’s a rather a lightweight sweatshirt that can be worn on a spring/fall day or evening. I ordered the blue/white, but fair warning, the blue stripes appear more gray to me than blue.

The colors are bright and cheery and ones that you’d never think of putting together in an outfit- they did… and it works! It’s super stylish in the pink and green alternating stripes with the neon yellow cuffs around the sleeves and neck adding drama as if the stripes colors isn’t enough to grab people’s attention!😂 The addition of the neon yellow collar and cuffs certainly ensures you’ll be noticed and seen! I wore this with a pair of jean shorts and it looked cute and contemporary . It looks just as great with jeans or leggings. It’s 75% cotton so it’s very soft and feels nice against my skin.  The added breathability that cotton offers makes it feel extremely soft. I love it so much I’m ordering another one right now! Definitely a great buy of a quality made, contemporary color & style shirt! I’ll be able to wear it  just about anywhere, anytime in any weather… talk about versatility!",3
