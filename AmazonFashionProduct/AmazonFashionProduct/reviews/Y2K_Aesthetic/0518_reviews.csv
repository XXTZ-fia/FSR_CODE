Crystal,Nice,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JEGR8T5OW81C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCZHSXSV,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 23, 2024",Color: F Grey Grunge TopSize: Small,,"Cute shirt. Sizing was great, got a small for my 14 year old and it fit her perfectly. She was happy with the style. The texture is like a light spandex material, so it’s stretchy. She also says it’s comfortable.",

The feel of the fabric is more plastic-y than normal softness.,
NotMyTypee,Runs very small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NTP2RS19IJ9X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCZHSXSV,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 22, 2024",Color: C Grey Striped ShirtSize: Large,,"I ordered a Large because I wanted it to be a bit loose. I usually wear a medium or even a small top, but this Large is very snug and I absolutely couldn't wear it if it were smaller. The fabric is soft and there's no annoying tag in the neckline, so that's nice. I'm pleased with it other than the sizing. I'll just have to wear it as a base layer.",
Nicole B.,"Very stylish, but runs small...",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FV0BDQYUI5PF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCZHSXSV,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2024",Color: J Black Red FlowerSize: Large,,"This Grunge Graphic Tee is really nice, but it runs small. I was hoping for a slightly loose fit, but I would've needed to order a minimum of two sizes up (at least) to accomplish that. It's pretty tight on me. The material is lightweight, and warm though. If it was larger it'd be really comfortable. I'd still recommend it, I'd just be aware the sizing is off.

The cropped length hits just at the right spot on my waist, and the sleeves are the perfect length for a flattering look. I would recommend checking the size chart before purchasing to ensure the best fit.",
ElBee,Good basic tee,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IQE8KYZPYSR0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCZHSXSV,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 18, 2024",Color: A Grey Grunge ShirtSize: X-Large,,"It's a basic shirt which runs true to size. It's a form fitting shirt, so keep that it mind if you don't want a tight fit- the seller photo is accurate. The fabric is just a tad thinner than I'd hoped (hence only four stars) it would be, but it is okay and the plus is that it isn't transparent.",
Mendie,not t-shirt material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RC7CIJF0GTAQG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCZHSXSV,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Color: F Grey Grunge TopSize: Small,,This top isn’t made with typical t-shirt fabric. It’s more of a silky feel to it. I ordered it small for my stepdaughter who wears a children size 12-14. It’s understandably large on her but she loves it.,

It pairs well with jeans. It fits true to size. I don't care for the font of the logo but I like the glitter and distressed look the logo has. The word on the front says luxurious.,

It's an adorable top, if it suits your figure and your personality. I am wearing size L and it is fitted and revealing but not too tight. My usual size is 12/14. I don't know what the letters mean.",
