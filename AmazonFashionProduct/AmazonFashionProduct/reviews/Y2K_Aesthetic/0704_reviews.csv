Tonya,Way too small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14IE73ON5TUW4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9V83WS7,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Lemon Print,Verified Purchase,"The Alyweatry Women Y2K Bikinis Set delivers on its promise of trendy coquette aesthetics, featuring charming bows and a flattering high-cut design. The halter tie-up top is stylish and adjustable, making it great for accentuating your neckline.  However, buyers should note that the sizing runs extremely small—about two sizes smaller than expected. This can make finding the right fit challenging, especially for those with fuller figures. While the elastic waist on the bottoms is forgiving, the overall fit may feel restrictive. For best results, consider sizing up significantly or exploring similar styles with more accurate sizing.",

Top fit perfectly. The bottoms are a little small so when you put it on it’s not very ruffled, but they fit good.

Kim,I bought both the original motel and this one,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ALDR9YO53A9W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9V83WS7,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 7, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Lace Trim Navy Blue,Verified Purchase,"The original one for motel rocks costs 4x more than this one from Amazon. The biggest aesthetic difference is the color.  The Amazon is a lighter shade of navy than the motel one.  Which one would I buy if they were both the same price?  The Amazon hands down.  The motel has weirdly long straps that aren’t adjustable, freakishly tiny cups even with my smaller boobs, no bra pads, and a cheap plastic clasp.  I was upset by how cheap the motel rocks one was when I got it.  I’ve bought better quality with Shein. The Amazon one has a metal clasp, adjustable straps and bra pads.  The bottom covers a little more for the Amazon one, but that doesn’t bother me.",16
