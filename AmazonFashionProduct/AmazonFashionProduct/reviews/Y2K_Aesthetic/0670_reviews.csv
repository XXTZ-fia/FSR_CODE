Geordie Holly,Not great quality.

Quite thin and a bit scratchy. SHEIN quality. They fit a little on the small side. Not decided if I like them enough to keep them. If they were like $20 I would but the price is a bit more than the quality honestly.,2

Unfortunately, the **fit was not great**. They’re a bit tight in some areas and loose in others, so they don’t sit as comfortably as I’d hoped. Also, they’re not very long, which was disappointing as I was hoping for more coverage.  If you're mainly after the print, these are fantastic, but if you’re looking for a great fit and good material, you might want to keep searching.",2

Meg,Very Odd Fit (For a women's US 14),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP1O6JQDJIBJ6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CS6B8MDH,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 16, 2024",,,"I am a very true women's size 14 for every brand, but this size chart seemed odd, so I checked the reviews for sizing. I saw someone who said they are a size 10-12 and a large fit them well, with a little room to spare, so I purchased both a large and an extra large. I could barely fit the extra large over my hips, and could barely zip them shut they were so tight. So I decided to try a 2XL because I like the jeans' print. The 2XL is even crazier, very very tight in the hips, especially where the thigh bends, but the waist is gigantic and goes up right under my chest. I am about 5'5-5'6 and never have this problem with jeans. I could see how maybe this could work if you are smaller and want that ""baggy"" low-rise fit, but if you are hoping for any other type of fit or are larger than a size 10, I would avoid these jeans.",
