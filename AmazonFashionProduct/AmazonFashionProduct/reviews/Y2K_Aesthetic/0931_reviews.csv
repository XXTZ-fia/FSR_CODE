Jenjen,Thought it would be longer…but not bad!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QUVX3L7AVXZI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF4Z7XNM,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 16, 2024",Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"It’s cute, brings two keychains for free, um, material is good in my opinion I mean first inspection it seems fine, no open seems or anything. However, instead of 15 inches it’s not like 13. I bought it mainly for college and for my laptop, my laptop is 14 inch, so I thought, ‘oh it should be ok!’ As you can see my laptop does not, in fact, fit. So I’m a little sad about that but overall it’s alright, I just won’t use it for my laptop and maybe other things (??) I don’t know.",
Steph Sparkles,fun bag,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2V08PA9QKGKX4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF4Z7XNM,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 28, 2024",Color: Black,,I've been looking for a new bag. I like a crossbody bag and who doesn't like stars. This has enough room for all my junk and still has a flap so it's not like it's just open for the whole world to see. Seems pretty sturdy too. I think it will last a while.,
Jaxon,"Versatile, Stylish, & Even Useful!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15LZ3ZFYJN1CB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF4Z7XNM,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 27, 2024",Color: Black,,"I chose black, thinking the red with white stars as too holiday-ish, and despite the fuzzy stars, this is great for year-round use. Instead of a purse, I prefer leather backpacks, to keep my hands free. This bag is going to work like the messenger bag it is. The adjustable strap is long enough to wear this as a cross-body [Yay], has open pockets on each end, two inside, and a zip pocket on the back. Easy fit for my iPad, planner, water bottle, phone accessories, shopping list, snack, & whatever other stuff requires yet another errand, all with easy access. Messenger bags can't be beat, better than lugging a tote bag or briefcase, and this bag is flexible, won't mind the rain, and the contents are easily accessible to you, but not there for the taking by others, and won't spill out when jostled. Black & white is always classy, even if it's just this handy-dandy bag.",
Wendy,Bad quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R96PEBNRAUW82/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF4Z7XNM,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 15, 2024",Color: Red,,"In the pictures, it shows that this item can hold an iPad, phone, etc. but when I purchased this product, it started to fray inside the bag. I have only had this bag for two months. All I had in it was a book, small sketchbook, and a few small and light necessities. This bag does not hold as much as they say it can.",
