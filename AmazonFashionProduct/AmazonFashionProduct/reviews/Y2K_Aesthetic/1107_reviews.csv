And so soft! It was made with high quality yarn. I crochet, so I am picky about yarns. If you don’t make a garment with a good quality yarn, it can end up stiff and scratchy. Not this one! It will be wonderful to wear around the house or out shopping when the weather cools down in the Fall. The color is gorgeous. It is a definite watermelon red. You could actually describe it more as pink. It’s a vibrant color, but with a soft pastel-like hue. The flowers are very detailed. See one of them in the picture. I would wash this garment in cold water with Woolite, lay on the bed to dry. Since it is meant to be baggy, order your regular size. I have the Small, which is my size, and it fits baggy, true to the style that’s intended. Wear it with jeans, or over a simple black dress for an evening out. Great sweater! If you love vintage sweaters, like I do, this would look fabulous with a solid color 1950s dress in white, yellow, pink, brown, or black. Even a green dress might work. I look forward to creating some wardrobe combinations with this sweater in the Fall!",8
