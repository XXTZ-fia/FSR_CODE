Robert H. Columbus,Cute but Sizing Inconsistent,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WVT722A6B15Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTTFL73W,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Color: CSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I ordered these in a small and medium. The color and design is perfect. Other reviews mention low quality. This is true. The zipper is janky and the fabric is lightweight. But you kind of expect that for the price and no brand name. I fluctuate between 6 and 8 in size jeans. While small was definitely too small the medium was too large around the waist and had a saggy crotch look. The picture shows the jeans hitting the floor. If you pull them up to eliminate the saggy crotch, the jeans become more cropped. Overall I wanted to keep these. Perhaps if they had more in between some options they would have worked. If you wear a size 10, these may work for you.",

There is absolutely no stretch in these, and if you are curvy, it can really make it challenging for them to fit your body properly without getting them altered. I am curvy and bottom heavy and these pants just were not a fit for my body type because of the tightness around my hip and butt area and, the massive gap in the back of the jeans. I really wish there was a little stretch or there was a design that suited a curve your body better.",2
