SmittyRealReviews!!,My Daughter Loves,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2E3X0L4LZOIUT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9JYPDFB,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 24, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Dark Blue,Verified Purchase,"I can’t take credit for this one. My daughter (14 yr old) picked this top out and had to have it. I was skeptical being that it looks like it is a crop top, and my daughter is not allowed to wear tops like that to school. I’m more of the practical parent, if you can’t wear it to school (where you spend most of your time) then you don’t need it. But I got it anyway. It’s actually not a crop top on my daughter, if fits a little longer than the picture shows. So she is able to wear it to school. In fact she’s been wearing it a lot! The quality is pretty good in the sense I wash my daughter’s clothes and it has not shrunk in the wash nor fallen apart. It still feels soft like it did when I bought it.",

I usually get a Large when purchasing shirts like this because I have wider shoulders and bust than most people who wear a Medium, so if you’re the same definitely go a size up.  Only complaint I have is that the text on my shirt is backwards but i’m just gonna pretend it’s an alien language lol",2
