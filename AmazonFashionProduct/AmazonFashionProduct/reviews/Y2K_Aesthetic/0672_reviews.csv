chloe,not super impressed,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21RG561FL1UWC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1GNVV24,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 28, 2024",Size: SmallColor: White Dogs Print,Verified Purchase,"I got the shirt with the three dog heads, and I'm not super impressed. For starters, the shirt is way more cropped in person than in the picture (it comes way above my belly button) and is a spandex material and not cotton. It also fits tight even though I got my regular size. It's still a cute shirt, but nothing like the picture.",3
Maddie,"Cute, soft shirt",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TQX5S5PKKA5E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1GNVV24,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 25, 2024",Size: SmallColor: White Cups,,"This is such a cute tee. It's got a girly, flattering cropped cut and the martini print is so cute. The material is soft and stretchy; I believe it is 100% polyester (imagine a stretchy athletic top), and it seems that the print is a sublimation-- meaning it is infused into the material, not printed or applied on top. Due to this, I've been careful to only tumble dry it on low heat out of caution (high heat can damage sublimation prints occasionally). The top is cute, definitely on the cheaper end, but it's perfect for casual wear.",
Charie S.,"Cute, but thin",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KHXRXV4I4VKM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1GNVV24,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 10, 2024",,,"This crop top is so cute, but also thin. Because of that and because it's white, you can see everything underneath. You can even see skin-tone bras through it, so I guess we'll have to wear something over it or style it differently.",
Rick Gray,Cute top but not for me,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DT6DBQ71NAY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1GNVV24,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 9, 2024",,,"I recently got this top and it is really cute, but it fits more like a crop top, not a baby tee. In addition, the graphic was printed on the shirt, and looked kind of cheap. The material was very soft and comfortable but overall it did not look good on me. I'm sure it would work for others though!",
Erik Coleman,Cute top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SB72QCI651GV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1GNVV24,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 7, 2024",Size: MediumColor: White Cups,,"I thought this baby tee would be perfect for a casual outfit with jeans, and it truly is! I get so many compliments whenever I wear it. One thing to note is that the print on the shirt is blurry. I initially thought it would be screen-printed for a more vintage look, but it still looks like the picture provided so that's fine.  Overall, this top is really cute and has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe!",
