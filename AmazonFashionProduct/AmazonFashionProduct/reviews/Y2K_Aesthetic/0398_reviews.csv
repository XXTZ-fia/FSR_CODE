The inside is fleece and the outside is an almost raincoat (?) texture. I thought that it would be more soft inside and that the outside was more like a cloth, so the material isn't what I was expecting. I normally wear a Large, but I looked at the sizing chart and ordered a XXL. It still fit like it was a fitted jacket rather than the baggy look I measured for. Giving it 2 stars because it is, in fact, a black reversible jacket, but it isn't what I was expecting and definitely not what I paid almost $50 for. I will be returning it.",5

We chose to purchase this because the photos clearly show one side to be fur, so that it should be reversible. The jacket is most certainly not fur on one side, but rather a thin ""sherpa"" fleece, so it is not the pretty reversible jacket pictured. The fit is okay, but this is not at all what we expected. We are very disappointed. This is one of the most misleading products we've ever purchased on Amazon. The product description/pictures need to be corrected immediately!",5

The reversible feature is a game-changer, allowing me to switch between the plush sherpa side and the textured fleece depending on my mood and outfit. The zip-up design adds a touch of Y2K nostalgia, which I absolutely adore. It's incredibly warm and comfortable, perfect for those brisk morning walks or cozy evenings out. The loose fit gives it a casual yet stylish vibe, and the pockets are a practical touch. I've worn it to coffee dates and weekend trips, receiving compliments each time. It's a versatile jacket that combines fashion with function, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The size chart was spot on, ensuring a great fit. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a trendy, cozy addition to their wardrobe.",

This jacket is not based on our U.S. standard sizing.  I normally wear a small/medium, and got this in an XL.  I was going to get it in an XXL, but it wasn't available to me.  I am 5'6"", about 150, 34D (VS), 27/28 in jeans, 40 inch hips, and an hourglass.  I normally wear a small, and generally get a medium in jackets to accommodate shirts underneath.  Based on the size chart, I was going to get an XXL to make it fit like it does in the description images, but as I said, the XL was the largest option available to me.  An XXL would have fit like the pics in the description pics perfectly, but the XL still fits oversized... just slightly less oversized than in the description photos.  As for the jacket itself, it is SO COMFORTABLE.  I am going to LIVE in it this winter.  The shell is soft, but the inside (faux fur) is even softer.  It's not stiff AT ALL.  I'm in love.",3
