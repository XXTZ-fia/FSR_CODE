mayigi58,So good but most of the earrings are VERY small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1U82IR7ZND2UF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGM488SY,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 30, 2024",Size: 7Pairs,Verified Purchase,"I really like these earrings a lot,they're almost exactly like the pictures,the only thing I don't like is that the sizes on some of them are EXTREMLY small,like in the pic of the small heart earrings they're so small and they screw and unscrew so it's really hard to put on so overall I'd give this product a 4.5 but since I can't a 4 (IF YOU LIKE/WANT BIG EARRINGS DON'T GET THIS ITEM!)",
Naeem,Ridiculously Adorable Set of Earrings,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCWFPRFPT6BIS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGM488SY,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 9, 2024",Size: 7Pairs,,"Normally when I get a set of earrings, there are a few I don't like but with these, they're all so stinking cute. One of them has screw-in backs, and the large star one has a unique way of clipping shut but all the others use regular backs or the rubber ones, depending what you prefer. The large hearts and the butterfly pairs are all multi-colored but in a pastel style, which is super cute.",2

Zager,Cute Assortment,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O0B3QTJU57FL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGM488SY,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 31, 2023",Size: 7Pairs,,"I was a little disappointed with these. I thought they would all have screw on backs from the first picture, but only one pair does. Sadly, it is also the pair I had no intention of wearing. I really like the two sided star ones though, very unique design. I really love that silicon backs were included as well. I managed to bend the posts on a pair I liked and use the silicon backs, so they don't stab my head while I sleep.",
