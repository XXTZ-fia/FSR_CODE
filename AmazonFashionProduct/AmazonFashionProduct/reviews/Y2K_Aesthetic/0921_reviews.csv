The fit is great but the smell is freaking terrible. It smells like incense you have to wash it before you wear it because of the smell",

The print on the shirt feels more plastic then regular graphic tee's. it's more something id wear for aesthetic rather then comfort. Although The shirt fits good.",

CJM,So Freaking Cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R285OM7WXMA49C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTFBBSD7,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 4, 2024",Color: Style06Size: Medium,,"This Y2K Graphic T Crop Top instantly elevates the retro chic aesthetic that is still on point, merging 2000s nostalgia with modern-day trendiness. Its updated fabric and fit make it not just comfortable but also a flattering choice. The vibrant graphic design adds a unique vintage flair, making it a versatile piece that pairs effortlessly with jeans, skirts, or shorts. I might be playing into the nostalgia a bit much here, but Y2K is quickly becoming one of my favorite brands because I have literally never been disappointed! And I love that all of my old faves are being introduced to a new crowd, who get to appreciate all of that 90s/00s awesomeness.",
Michelle,Skinny people fashion,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJUZHP2WFM6ZK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTFBBSD7,"2.0 "," the United States "," April 3, 2024",Color: Style06Size: Large,,I sized up yet the shirt still flattens my chest and it’s definitely not flattering. Also the crop is at an odd length that’s like nearly a shirt but definitely cropped at the bottom. I will say that is better than the crop tops that are essentially a bandeau. It’s fine if that’s what you want out of a crop top but it’s nice to have more length if you’re still looking for a shirt. If you have a flatter chest it could be a nonissue for you. B cup and smaller are probably a fine fit. The design on the shirt is a plastic sort of decal on the tshirt. The sleeves aren’t uncomfortably tight for the arms. The neck hole isn’t too small either. It seems to be the no-effort sort of fashion that’s been big with skinny people who don’t have to try very much to look acceptable in what they wear. This isn’t something I see myself wearing for both comfort and styling reasons.,

GoldenC74,DO NOT BUY,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EN5RL1FY18HH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTFBBSD7,"1.0 "," the United States "," March 2, 2024",Color: Style06Size: Small,Verified Purchase,"I was very excited for this to come since it seemed like a cute design and I waited around 3 weeks before it came. When it arrived I thought they got my order wrong. The shirt is not small at all and is definitely not a baby tee. The shirt is very stretchy and the cherries on the shirt feel like plastic. The shirt is also very very thing and the color of my cherries and shirt look a lot different than in the photos. The shirt is a bright white along with the cherries being bright light red, not like the dark red the photos have. So disappointed. This shirt seems like it would have only cost 3 bucks to make. Do not buy",9
