MrsScheri,Heavy denim- high quality.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7FZDD21NA9EQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQ35MYF9,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 31, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"These are a dark, dirty wash blue. I thought from the image they were a faded black. So that was a little disappointing. That being said…the denim is a great quality. The stripes and stars are sewn onto the jeans. The weight surprised me, I thought they would be cheaply made…they are not. I’m excited to gift them.",

These seem to be made well and are definitely a cool piece to have!",4
