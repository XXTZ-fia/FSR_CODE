Pegi P,It’s not what you think. Very flimsy!! Don’t think it’s going to hold its shape,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UU5IJ74J6Q12/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4V6XPR1,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Green,Verified Purchase,Very flimsy stars not completely sewn down.

The neck area of the shirt was obviously cut off using scissors and the seams have not been properly hemmed. The star is partially detached from the shirt.,

I bought it for my daughter and she loves it.  It looks exactly like a shirt that I had back in 1998 - yes, I'm old.  The only thing is that the green on the shirt is a different color than it appears in the picture.  It looks more grayish-green in the picture, but it's kind of an unattractive brighter army green in person.  It's also very short. It comes up higher up on my daughter than the girl in the picture, but I guess this varies based on your body frame.  The sleeves were also very long on her, covering her hands.  The material is pretty thin, so it's form fitting.",

I had to get my daughter to see what a disappointment this shirt was! We laughed hysterically for 5 minutes! The material is horrible and is not sweater/cotton material as seen in picture. It looks inside out, the edges of the star are loose, and the collar area looks stretched out and wavy. Polyester sleeves and star…looks way too cheap and uncomfortable/itchy feeling.",

On one hand, it's still cute and fits a grungy look. On the other hand, I expected better quality for how much I paid for it. If this quality was sent directly to someone as a gift I'd be super disappointed. I love the style of it but it just isn't what it seems like unfortunately.  We will see how my daughter likes it in a couple days on her birthday. We might be returning it.",
