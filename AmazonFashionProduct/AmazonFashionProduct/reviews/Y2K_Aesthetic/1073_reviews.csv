The shirt fit nice, hugs me like I prefer. The quality of the fabric was good. Soft and comfy. The style is very nice, cute and just what I wanted. Unfortunately the off the shoulder fold and fabric is not sewn down, leading it to ride up. I had someone help me pull it down, but there isn't enough fabric or stretch to fit properl",

Anne Marie,"Unfortunately, returning it",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXVT97NU41TII/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNG48ZXG,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 10, 2024",Color: Off Shoulder BeigeSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"For reference, I’m 5’2 and 105lbs.  So, this is what I like to call a gamble piece. No prior ratings or reviews, lower priced, but still cute enough that I would buy it just to see if I’d like it. The material is so thin everything underneath is see through, the straps are not even straps lol they will fall off in 2.2 seconds, and you can barely move your arms while wearing it cuz the flap that’s supposed to cover your bust constricts your movements. I’m definitely returning this.",3
