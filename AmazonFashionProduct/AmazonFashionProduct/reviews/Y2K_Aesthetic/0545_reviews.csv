She loves wearing backless dresses, so I thought she might like this.  She was very excited about the top and how soft the material was, but she said that it wears a little odd on her and she kept having to adjust it after reaching up or down to grab or lift anything.  Because of this, she did not feel comfortable wearing it out.  She did say that it would probably wear better on taller figures with a little more bust.  She’s shorter (5’5” and smaller chested (34/36b) and about 135lbs.",

The shirt needed constant adjustments to the back and shoulders.  I’ll keep it to wear as lounge wear or sleep wear but it’s too fussy to wear out.  Perhaps a person with a longer torso might have a better fit.  Fabric is buttery soft.,56
