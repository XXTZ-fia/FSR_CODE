Christy,"Good at first, got worse throughout the year",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11TDUMYENHRY8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHVZ4TLM,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 28, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"I bought this at the beginning of the school year (august), and it was great at first. The zippers would get stuck every now and then, but it didn’t seem like a big deal. Over time, the quality got worse. The zippers would get completely undone and break off. The straps I had to sew in the beginning because they would slide right through. I was taking the bag out of my car, and the left strap completely broke. I had to tie it on so it would stay. I love the design and color, and it fits all of my stuff pretty well (high school things), but it gets pretty heavy too. The bag does its job, though for how much it cost, so cost wise it was probably worth it. I do wish the quality was better though.",
