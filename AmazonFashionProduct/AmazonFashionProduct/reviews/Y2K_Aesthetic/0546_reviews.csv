I was curious because fourteen dollars and such a bunch of great reviews for a FP dupe looks great online, but it is not as expected.  The fabric doesn't have a cotton feeling, but instead a more synthetic look and feel with a shine that is not a good quality product indicator, but the opposite and i dislike. Quality is not there.  Stitching in the front has a noticeable lack of symmetry.  Disappointed. Not a dupe, not a good one itself.",

First off, it’s oversized (as promised) and super comfortable. The material feels lightweight but still substantial enough to keep you warm in cooler weather. It’s versatile, too—perfect for lounging around, layering up, or even pulling off a casual, chic vibe with leggings. The colors are vibrant and true to what’s advertised, and it washes pretty well if you stick to cold water and low/med-temp air drying. Bonus points for not shrinking like some other oversized tops that over-promise!  That said, not everything is sunshine and stripes. The fit is a bit divisive—I find it flattering and roomy, but I can see where a few have noted shorter sleeves and a slightly boxy look, especially if you're on the taller side or prefer a sleeker fit. It's also not top quality, the fabric is a little thin and some minor stitching issues, though those are rare. Personally, I’d say sizing up gives you that perfect slouchy feel, and you’ll avoid most shrinkage concerns that way.  All in all, if you’re into trendy, comfy basics with a splash of style, this sweatshirt’s a solid pick. It’s cute, easy to style, and won’t break the bank—just keep your care routine in mind to keep it looking its best!",
