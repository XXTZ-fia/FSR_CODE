Nondh,Shirt type material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15Q03NPG0F43M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6W8RL38,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 14, 2024",Size: SmallColor: 7-black,Verified Purchase,"I wore this skirt to an Evanescence concert, and while it looked beautiful, I had mixed feelings about it. The material was soft, stretchy, and comfortable, but I was expecting something with a bit more structure to hold the pleated look better. It ended up being shorter and less fluffy than it appeared in the pictures, which made it feel simpler than I had hoped for. Overall, it's a decent skirt, but not quite what I was expecting in terms of style.",
