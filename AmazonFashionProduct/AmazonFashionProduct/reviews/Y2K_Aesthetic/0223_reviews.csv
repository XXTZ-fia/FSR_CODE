It really upsets me that the original creators of this jacket haven't really been getting support for their own craft yet. The creator's name is literally on the front of the damn jacket it says ""S-☆S-onder "" (the ""S"" goes for both the ☆(starry) and ""Sonder"". Also, a key detail is that with the og creators, the lettering is embroidered onto the jacket, not just pasted on like a damn stick bro 💀💀 (I would show proof of me owning the sweater but im out of town rn💀)",2
