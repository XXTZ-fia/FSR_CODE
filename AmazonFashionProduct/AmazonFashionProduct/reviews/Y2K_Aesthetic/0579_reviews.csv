John,My friend loved it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VKMVFUNMVSSM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CL4LN6SS,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",,Verified Purchase,It’s true to size and design. Originally it said it would take a month to arrive but came in two weeks. The print was very pretty and it’s good for the value of money. I would say it’s a little thin but if you get a darker color it shouldn’t be a problem! You can’t see bra line underneath so it’s not too thin. Great tank top! My friend loved it as her Christmas gift. I got it from her Pinterest board. She just got into soft goth and I think this shirt is perfect!,

Dakota Walker,Fantastic buy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D1FJ5P5FQURY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CL4LN6SS,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 12, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Army Green Print,Verified Purchase,"I bought this shirt due to the grunge and unusual design and fell in love with it! Upon arrival I was slightly displeased with the texture as it was definitely more plastic feeling than what I was expecting. All in all, the shirt is more than comfortable to wear and washes well without any damage to the print or fabric. I’d say get a size larger than normal, as it fits me a bit tight and rides up my stomach a bit due to the texture of the shirt. The price point is definitely worth it for the quality and longevity of the shirt. 7.5/10 would recommend!",

It is super cute and she loves it BUT you can see the side of her bra through the arm holes…. Like a good 1/2-1” on both sides.  She is a B cup.  The shirt fits well other than that… but it is kind of a big deal so I gave it 3 stars.  Otherwise would have been 4 because it is fast fashion.,2

It's not as long as I was hoping but there's also a little too much room on the side boob, so that's probably because I'm a little too busty. I followed the advice in comments and sized up, I'm usually extra small or small and I got medium, which is good. I am currently 5'3"" and 115lbs, w DD cups. The color is what I expected (olive) and the stitching isn't perfect but I think it's a little more punk that way. :) if you think 30 bucks is too much then you're probably right but I like the style and I'm very happy I bought it.",
