At first I bought one in green and I loved it so much I bout 4 more colors. I can pair them with so many looks. They do come down low and I have a rather large chest.

The material is great as well. I can wear a bra with them or just some silicone stick on covers. The style is very comfortable.,

The material was a little cheap, but to be expected. Fabric was a sort-of soft polyester feel and it was an accurate gray color compared to the photo. The style looked almost identical to the photo. However, the neckline was very low, and sat below the bottom of my breasts. I am very small chested and when I bent over, my entire breast was visible as the cups were a bit loose. I had to return the shirt. It may be doable for those with slightly larger breasts if they use fashion tape.",
