Couple of things to note: - sizing between colors is NOT consistent. I have this dress in the green and brown long versions- both size S, however the green is noticeably tighter and fits my chest a bit better in comparison. - Back is shirred but in an unflattering way. You can tell the back pattern just doesn't flow as seamlessly, and the silhouette doesn't translate the same. - prints are decent.  Generally, I think these are really decent dupes and I'm happy I saved the money in this instance. They're really versatile and can be dressed up or down, used day or night, and across multiple occasions. :)",2

It's clear that Omoone changed the fabric used for these dresses because the ones from last year are in a thicker, silkier fabric than the new ones. In comparison the new ones feel low quality. They literally weigh less than the old ones (in a bad way). I also think because the fabric is a lot thinner now, the dresses drape differently and are less flattering. Disappointing because I really liked these dresses. Before, I'd confidently give them a 5 star review. Now I don't think they're worth the $40. Please bring back the old fabric if possible!!",2

The material is thinner than a pillowcase, (with 0 layers to make up for it), and the design looks printed on. It hangs off me like a nightgown (I’m 5’5” and 120 lbs) and doesn’t touch my curves.
