Unfortunately, it's just kind of a cheapy iron-on transfer rather than printed on. But I guess that's a case of you get what you pay for! It's okay other than that.",
Charlotte T.,Love it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S3B8Q873V9U7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWLC1T5V,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 12, 2024",Size: SmallColor: A Olive Bowl Tank Top,,"Absolutely loving this tank top! 🍒 It's got such a fun Y2K vibe with the olive print that's perfect for summer.

Definitely a cute addition to my summer wardrobe! 😊 Can't wait to pair it with some high-waisted shorts or jeans. Overall, thumbs up for style and comfort!",

Megan Meier,Decent tanktop,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R132IUCNE7JVN3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWLC1T5V,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 28, 2024",,,"Overall, I like the top. I loved the idea of the cute little clam shells on front. I'm 5'6"" 133lbs and ordered a medium instead of my usual small and glad I did. The length is actually fine and sits right at or just below my belly button so not really a crop top. The neckline is ok - it reminds me of a little girl's top with thicker straps, one I likely wore as a kid. The graphics seems to be iron on versus part of the fabric but are applied well. We'll see how it does in the wash. The fabric is soft too, a smooth polyester versus a soft cotton. Cute top for summer.",2
S.D.B.,Cute But Cheap,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17MO2B3YAIZZ2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWLC1T5V,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 26, 2024",Size: SmallColor: A Olive Bowl Tank Top,,"I got the olives tank top; got several compliments on it, definitely cute. It's polyester so the fabric feels super synthetic, but it wasn't see through like some reviews say. The design is an iron-on transfer which has a reflective sheen that I don't like. It's cute but the quality isn't there.  I'm 5'3"", 130lbs and I got a small. It fit nicely with some room to spare, which I liked. It would absolutely stretch if you happened to order too small, depends in the fit you're looking for. The neckline is a little high, but that's fine.",
Neodymium Bean,Super cute :),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KPK4ZBLBEMI2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWLC1T5V,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 23, 2024",Size: MediumColor: A Shrimp Tank Top,,"I adore this shirt! I love the shrimp design; it's very vibrant. The fabric is actually super stretchy and comfortable, although a bit sheer. It looks fine with a light colored bra underneath. There's a loose thread near the armpit, but other than that the shirt is lovely.",
Ancilla A.,Good fit.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M4OK3ENHE7CF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWLC1T5V,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 22, 2024",Size: SmallColor: A Shell Tank Top,,I think the fit and material are good. The quality of the design is poor and seems like an iron on design that is kind of pixelated in print.,

I got it in a medium and it’s true to size. Slim fit but the white doesn’t accentuate anything, just makes me look slim. The white is very vivid and it has no stains. The design on it is very cute and it’s just right. I think it may be a little see-through, I can’t really tell. Nothing a light colored bra won’t fix.",
