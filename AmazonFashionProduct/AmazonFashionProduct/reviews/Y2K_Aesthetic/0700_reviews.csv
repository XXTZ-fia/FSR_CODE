Doesn’t match the photo !!!,Only see the stars if the flash or light is on.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36XNMLNSO9V95/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BSZXXZPN,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 30, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Star Gray,Verified Purchase,It is very dark and wasn’t what I was expecting. Although it is good sweater material the zipper seems weak and it was just a big let down. I thought the stars would be light but they are darker than the sweater itself. If you’re looking at me from a few feet away it looks like a dark gray zip up nothing special or fancy.,
