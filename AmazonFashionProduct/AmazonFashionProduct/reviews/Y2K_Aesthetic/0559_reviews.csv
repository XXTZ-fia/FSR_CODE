Pat- bo-bat,kinda fire ngl,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R359WS6L1GF7XM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CW2TSF11,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 2, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,"My first review comment because I'm just cool like that. These are kinda nice, I very much enjoy them to the point where I bought a second pair in the darker color! (yippee!)  I normally don't order clothes online because more often than not they're nothing like they're listed as and fall apart easily, but so far these pants have survived the hectic life of a percussionist that lacks most if not all of their special awareness. Seeing as Im always around instruments that sit directly at hip level, I more often than not have snagged the pockets of these pants on beams and such, and yet nothing has ripped! They feel nice, are decently warm (I live up north so this is important) AND I look cool.  The only thing that i would say is that if you want a SUPER baggy look, buy a size up. I wear a large, ordered a large, and they fit a large perfectly. They are baggy enough, but dont drag on the ground or anything.  For my second pair, I ordered an XL, and they are practically perfect for all my angsty baggy jeans needs  ALSO ALSO POCKETS ALL THE POCKETS I FEEL LIKE A MAN WITH ALL THESE POCKETS",

Jaclyne,Size up,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28A7G2I2MWOG9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CW2TSF11,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 22, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Blue,,I love the heavy fabric however they are quite a bit snug.  I normally wear a 10 so I ordered the large and while I can button them they are incredibly fitted and the fabric has zero stretch. I’m scared to wash them after reading other reviews.  The length is great though,
Dakota Walker,My favorite pants I own !!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QCLMZI2MJ35/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CW2TSF11,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 12, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Dark Grey,Verified Purchase,"Besides the awkward picture listed, these pants have literally become a part of me!! Upon arrival they seemed a tad large for me but a belt seemed to do just the trick. With the longevity, I have owned these pants for about 5 months now and they have been perfect! The only thing I would look out for in long term use is that the pants did shrink very slightly but it compensated for the extra room in the pants. They are not very stretchy but are very roomy so you will not experience any constriction in these! Although they are baggy, they add such a unique and flattering silhouette to my appearance. I had to buy a second pair after I got these so I can always wear them! 10/10 recommend!!",

The first pair the zipper was broken.  The second pair had no hole for the button to close. I opened the area and added that. But now they are still too baggy in the front and need to be altered by my tailor.  They are nice and thick material.,

Cheryl,really cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QWMESFIRFVZJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CW2TSF11,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,For these jeans I’d say stick to your size. I sized up to a large and it was a mistake. A lot of people are saying the jeans are sewn but that’s very common for this style of jean online. You just need to snip the opening i didn’t even need to do that I just pushed the button through. I was scared because there aren’t many reviews but they’re SO CUTE. I gave it a 4 bc I am returning these pair for a smaller size. The waist of the actual L jeans are 34 inchs not 31,7

Had to do it myself.  Buttons themselves are questionable with their integrity.  I feel I may have to redo those myself also.  The material was nice and heavy.,2
Maddie,I love them,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MQG6ESFEWTJY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CW2TSF11,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 17, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,I love how them are I would but them again. They are so cute but there is no whole fotlr the button on the pocket there is a whole above the zipper so I don't mind It to much. They do fit pretty good I did size up just on case and they were perfect (I do have a bigger butt so I was worried about these) and I have worn there alot of times and they haven't shruk or anything,7
