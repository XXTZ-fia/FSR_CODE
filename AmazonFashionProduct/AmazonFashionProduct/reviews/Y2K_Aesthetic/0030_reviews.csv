It looks much nicer than just a plain old t-shirt without sacrificing the comfort of a t-shirt. It looks much more put together, but not too dressy if you’re just lounging around at home. I would say that if you’re wearing this shirt with a larger jacket in cold weather, it may feel a little stuffed due to the oversized fit of this shirt, but it’s perfect for cooler weather that doesn’t require outerwear.",

The inside isn’t lined with anything and was very scratchy and uncomfortable feeling. Maybe if I had washed it, it would have softened up but didn’t want to risk that. Too much hassle. I also wish this came in an xs. I felt the small swallowed me up and didn’t look good on me. There was too much fabric to tuck into a sports bra so had to go back. Colors are very vibrant and it was a good price otherwise.  Bottom line: Was worth the try but not for me.",11

He wears an xl in men’s and it was slightly loose on him. Maybe this is supposed to be oversized for a plus sized woman but not for an average size.,
