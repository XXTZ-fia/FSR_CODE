Joy,Wrong color and missing the lace,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWES254NVX63B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BBLWSP5P,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 31, 2024",Color: X Brown 3Size: Small,Verified Purchase,"I ordered the brown shirt and was sent the navy blue one instead. The shirt did not come with the lace undershirt, which makes the title of the product misleading. The fit of the top sent was true to size.",
Tristen Pack,great shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36QUQ2L06RL1J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BBLWSP5P,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Color: Gray 5Size: Small,Verified Purchase,i love the way it fits the material is a little itchy but not too bad. The lace on the inside is not a secondary shirt it is instead just a chunk of lace sewn into the shirt. Which isn’t really an issue but you’re busty the lace does not like to stay out and you’ll have to adjust it.,

Savana,Wear with an undershirt.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWM63ZRJ45ZLP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BBLWSP5P,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 6, 2023",Color: X White 1Size: Small,Verified Purchase,This shirt is so adorable and i will be wearing it all the time. The only issue i have is that the shirt is see through so you have to wear with an undershirt. Other than that the shirt is true to size but the sleeves are a little long and the shirt goes to my hips.,
