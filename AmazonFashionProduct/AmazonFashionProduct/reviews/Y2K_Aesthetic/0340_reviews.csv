The white hoodie has a awesome design. My daughter receives complements on ot whenever she wears it. The other 2 hoodies never arrived butc the company was incredibly quick giving me a refund and gave me a no hassle delay! I would certainly buy from them again!,
I ordered the white jacket with the black designs and the jacket came in grey it’s still cute and looks nice and fits well but opening it and expecting the white to see the jacket in grey was extremely disappointing.,Dif color,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SAAHBCCPYNAP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BGSL1VVJ,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2024",Color: Printed GreySize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I disliked how it showed a white color and I got this jacket in grey, still really cute tho",

Sarah,Super cute!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R378QP152VJ2HO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BGSL1VVJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 30, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"I LOVE this little jacket! The rhinestones are so adorable, I love the color and the pattern on it! It’s pretty light weight which is nice for layering outfits. Only con I noticed is the zipper seems a little flimsy, hopefully it won’t break. Also the designs on the jacket are very clearly low quality and are sort of pixely, they also get cut off at the top of the coat where the hood connects but honestly none of it is that obvious from farther away and I really don’t mind.",4
