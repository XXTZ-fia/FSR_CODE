They look great on my body, I love it! The hem has some cute designs, Yuh ~ I noticed. The stitching is very flattering and gives off a classic vibe. The unstitched ones are more casual and have a cool look. The fabric seems good quality, but I'm not sure if it's prone to stretching out. The colors are a bit different from the pictures, but they still look good to wear.",
Sharlene G.,Love the baby blue color and super soft fabric!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4TC8EYD2Q5K9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQLT4DMQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 27, 2024",Size: MediumColor: C-blue,,"I ordered this cami in ‘C-blue’ which has a white bow in the front.  The shade of blue is baby blue and the white bow is a cute addition.  It’s made of 100% polyester fabric with a high degree of stretch.  It’s super soft making it comfortable to wear.The adjustable straps are made from the same polyester fabric with clear, plastic hardware.  The slides work well for adjusting the strap length and are positioned in the back.  The online photos show the slide in the front.This top is neatly sewn and the seams are finished with an overlock stitch.  The online photos display a top that isn’t hemmed but the top that I received is neatly hemmed with double stitching.  Machine wash cold and line dry.  I’ll use a mesh bag when washing to prevent stretching.I’m 5’4” tall, 119 pounds with a 36.5 inch bust and 27 inch waist.  I ordered this top in medium and it’s close fitting, flattering and comfortable.  The hem falls at the top of my legs.  The beautiful fabric and fit make this a top I’m happy to have in my closet.",8

Rebecca,"Unlike Picture, Weird Fabric",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TEN3600XX8AH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQLT4DMQ,"3.0 "," the United States "," February 20, 2024",Size: SmallColor: C-blue,,"While the tank top looks like the picture in shape, the fabric and color is different. I got the blue tank top and the blue was much more bright and saturated than the baby blue color in the picture. The fabric was also very smooth and thin, and hugs your body in a way that shows everything (in a bad way), since the picture made the fabric seem more cotton-like.",2
