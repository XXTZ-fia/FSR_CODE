Believeinu,Too big.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GSFDIE9JYK7J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB16J41B,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: PinkSize: Medium,,"So I got this hoodie bc it looked so cute, and personally I like my hoodies tight fitted so that’s why I got a small, and don’t get me wrong the quality is very soft and nice, but I did NOT think the small was gonna be this big. I personally don’t like my hoodies big like I said, and I don’t even wanna imagine how big the other sizes are. But if you do like big hoodies then this is a really good one, I’m just upset bc I didn’t think it was gonna be this big especially for a small.",

Jill-Elizabeth (Jill Franclemont),Definitely oversized and super cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OF62TCT40WBU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB16J41B,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 17, 2024",Color: PinkSize: X-Large,,Sulayesh Star Hoodie Oversized Y2k Sweatshirts for Women Cute Stars Graphic Letter Print Hoodies Aesthetic Trendy Pullover  This is such a cute hoodie! The pink is super bright - like bubblegum - and the white design really pops. It is definitely oversized - in a good way - and offers a comfy easy fit that is very cute with leggings or skinny jeans. It is a nice weight - warm enough to keep you cozy but not so heavy that it is unwieldy to wear.,
Tiffany,Stylish hoody!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2H8QLQHMYHL5Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB16J41B,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 13, 2024",Color: PinkSize: Large,,"I love this hoody because it is cute, pink, and very much like the photos! The inside is very comfortable and soft. The fabric does not break down in the washer or the dryer so the other clothes I mixed in with the hoody were totally fine. It is very warm and great to wear on a chilly or cool day. I love the look!",
