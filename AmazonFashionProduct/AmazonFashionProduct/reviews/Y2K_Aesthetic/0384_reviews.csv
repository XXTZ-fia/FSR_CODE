Tony,my everyday bag,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29EWEGBLW0NFH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B1F6WVLN,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Color: Army Green,Verified Purchase,"honestly love the size and functionality of the bag. The cross body sling is comfortable and easy to adjust. I get complimented on this bag at least once a week and am always having people ask me where I got it from. Only negative about the bag is that the frayed edges of the sling causes the thread to come off easily and I am constantly ripping off the strings. However, I think that the loose strings sometimes add character to the bag lol.",
Mrs. Angela Lee,Nice bag,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B1DKK18EAD71/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B1F6WVLN,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 24, 2024",Color: Army Green,Verified Purchase,This was a Christmas gift.,

It also slides out of where it attaches to the bag regularly.",
Petra,Not good,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R62C8VO8N50HK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B1F6WVLN,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 8, 2024",Color: Army Green,Verified Purchase,"Craftsmanship is the only problem. The zipper is misaligned by a few inches, making the closure more of a suggestion and threads keep unraveling out of it unprompted. If it were made better it would have been perfect.",
JennRijos,Nice bag but the shoulder strap frays too much,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QTUTY0OJN6UL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B1F6WVLN,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 21, 2024",Color: Black,Verified Purchase,I love the size of the bag and the material but they didn’t sew the shoulder strap correctly so that the ends don’t fray. I’m constantly having to pull off strings.,

Amazon Customer,Great! but the strap could use some work,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16X4CANIJFMQR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B1F6WVLN,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 7, 2024",Color: Army Green,,"This is my favorite bag! The edges of the strap fray and there's nothing stopping it from sliding right out though, I wove it back in the buckle and that seemed to keep it in place. Other than the issues with the strap it's a wonderful bag. (I also had a big enamel pin on it to keep it from sliding out for a while)",3
Nicole Winfield,Great quality!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12O10MM8QK3ST/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B1F6WVLN,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 19, 2023",Color: Army Green,Verified Purchase,I absolutely love this bag! It’s made really well and thick,

It’s not well made and it smelled really bad, I think it may be the dye or something, seemed washable- so gently washed it, bought came apart, still smelled. The idea is cute, the style is cute.

I like the appearance the quality was pretty good. I just wished the material was not so heavy by the time you put a wallet, keys, or anything in it, just pulled your clothes down at the top of the shoulder and was not comfortable at all to carry. But overall it was a nice bag.",3

Jasmine Morales,"Love it, love it, love it!!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZXPF3NTD9FOP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B1F6WVLN,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 7, 2023",Color: Army Green,Verified Purchase,"So far, I LOVE this bag. I got it to use for work, and have been greatly impressed. It fits everything I need (My MacBook, my lunch, even my tumbler!). The only thing that I had a slight problem with (and I mean slight) was that the strap would loosen while I walked. While I feel this was also my doing, with all the weight I put in it, it was a simple fix. All I did was pull the strap back through the top and it hasn't come loosened since. Highly recommend!! Especially for a college student like me.",5
