Allie,Good Quality Basic,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B9VT75KQZX7O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CFY73V42,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 13, 2024",Size: LargeColor: B-white,Verified Purchase,"This is a very nice top. The fabric is a cotton blend, soft and stretchy. The lace is higher quality, doesn't seem like it will rip or snag. The bow adds an additional cute touch. The top is slightly cropped but not too short. I was comfortable enough to wear with mid rise pants. I ordered a size Large, I'm 143lbs and 5""7. I would say it runs like junior sizing. My only disappointment was seeing this same top in a 2 pack for $20 after I already purchased one for $14.99.",2
