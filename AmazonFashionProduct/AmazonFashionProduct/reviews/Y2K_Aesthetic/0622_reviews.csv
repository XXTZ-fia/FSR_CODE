Definitely one of those dresses I'll be adjusting and pulling down all evening, but it's comfortable at the same time.  It has one strap on the right shoulder that is adjustable like a bra strap. The fabric color is as pictured on Amazon. My photos in the mirror show it as more of a watermelon red/pink, but it is a true pink color in person. I took one photo by my window, and that shows the color better. The fabric is thick enough so that it's not really transparent in the light. It will show a silhouette, but no details, so this has potential to be worn without undergarments. The fabric is a smooth, stretchy material, and the top is double-lined. For reference, I am 5'6"", 140 lbs., somewhat athletic build. I bought a Medium in this dress.",15

It actually was really pretty and comfortable. However, I am returning because the bust was just too big and the length too short for me. I am 5’6’ 145lbs bigger butt so I am always worried about mini dresses. I got a size medium and it fit pretty well overall just rode up way too much when I was walking this size would work better for someone with a C cup I am more of a b and just not filling it out. There weren’t any reviews when I ordered so hopefully this helps! It’s a cute dress! And straps are adjustable",16
