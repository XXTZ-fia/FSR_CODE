It's not too thick or bulky. But it does have weight to it and, to me, that translates to high-quality materials being used. The navy blue and green stripes go so well together and I also like the contrast of the ribbed hem, cuffs and collar in that mustard yellow. My daughter fell in love with this pullover. As soon as she saw it, she begged to have it, claiming it was stylish and trendy. She said she loves the feel of it. It's very comfortable and not confining and she feels like she can move fluidly in it. She's excited to wear with skinny blue jeans and black combat boots. And top it with her black knee-length peacoat. Great sweater at a great price! For reference, she's wearing an XL - she's 5'3 and 180 lbs",

Bonnie,Cute but not pink!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NN31O1LICKPY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFTCR1XH,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 5, 2024",Color: PinkblueSize: Large,,"This sweatshirt is very cute! I ordered a L,( I’m usually a medium or large). The large fits oversized like I want a sweatshirt to fit but not too huge. My only issue is that the color I ordered was called pink and blue but the pink is definitely more of a peach. If you look at the picture carefully you can see this. I will be keeping this and it was a steal with the $11 coupon!The inside of the fabric is not fleece like some sweatshirts. It is more of a woven fabric-not uncomfortable but not super soft.  I will be keeping this and it was a steal with the $11 coupon!",3
