They are not long enough to be baggy.  The color was more dirty and used than the blue shown.  They don't sit well on the waist and are totally unflattering.,

Overall quality feels cheap and legs aren't as long as pictured / what I thought they would be. Looks slightly different from the picture but is a decent pair of jeans.

Stella,sizing is very odd,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REHBDNK95X056/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGN8G9VR,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Blue,,"So the sizing chart was a little odd when ordering - the largest size was an M. I would have normally tried a large- but this size was good - sort of. The legs were wide and roomy - like a large size. The waist was a lot smaller - I barely can get the button done :/ The waist is more of a size small/medium - and just odd. I do love the star cut outs on these - they're fun and give these jeans a unique look. The wash is also a nice blue, not too dark, but sort of light and vintage. I washed these first - they came bagged with an odd odor. There are no tags or labels either... also a little odd. I can do some work to make these work but they are very different from ""standard"" sizing, but they do have a great look! very fun!",
