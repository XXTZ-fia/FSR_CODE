On the photos it looks like a 100% cotton Gildan kind of t shirt. This is shiny Shein like material. It’s also a baby tee which i was expecting a normal fit shirt. Quality is bad in general and see through (to be expected with most white shirts though). The graphic is cute and it shipped faster than expected. Will most likely be returning if possible.,6

I sized up for a more loose fitting and oversized top versus it being super cropped and I am so glad that I did. I tried this on with a pair of jean shorts and loved the look! I love that the graphic design on this tee isn't an iron on looking design. The drink glasses blend in with the material of the rest of the shirt, they don't look liike plastic or shiny compared to the rest of the top which I think looks much nicer and more expensive for a top like this. This is such a cute, comfortable and unique baby tee!",
Review’s by me,Such a comfortable and cute shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22ASX8561FXD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2D6M4FM,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 7, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Sea Animal White,,It sits snug and isn't too short of a crop top.

SM,"Cute idea, not the best execution",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7BLX5A67M1CA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2D6M4FM,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 3, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Tree Martini Wine Beige,,"The material of the shirt I got is super soft but on the thinner side. I would say definitely size up if you don't want it to be overly cropped. I got a medium and the sleeves are a little too tight. The idea of the graphic is so cute, love the 3 martinis. However the execution of the graphic on the tee is a little janky, when you're up close to it you can tell that it's kind of blurry and the details get lost. From far away it's cute though.",
Taylor & Sean,It’s alright,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Q3OKIWK31L6H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2D6M4FM,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 17, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Bow Martini Multicolor,Verified Purchase,The material is a type of material I would never have imagined. The image printed on the shirt looks great but the material used ruined it honestly. Price point may be a little steep for what you get. It’s also very very cropped. I would probably give 2.5 stars if possible,3
