This top definitely runs small and tight. I would definitely recommend sizing up 2. The truck print on the shirt is an iron on shiny sticker. The print quality was pretty disappointing,

I got the white one with the truck, and it was so see through, also the neck line did not look like the photo it was thick and in my option ugly.

If u are anyone else and u like thick collar necks DONT get it in white unless u want it to be see through. Idk if the other colors are cute but white is a no no.",

What stood out to me most is the material. It is incredibly soft and good quality, not the thin, almost see-through fabric that most shirts like these are made of. I was worried that I would have to wear a tank top underneath to avoid it being see-through, but it was fine without. It has a good bit of stretch to it and is very comfortable. I sized up to a Large (my usual size is Medium) to get a little extra length since it is a cropped fit, and the Large fits exactly how I wanted it to. I'm very pleased!",

It fits me very well, so it definitely runs about a size smaller. The fabric is about average thickness for a t-shirt anymore. However, both the color of the fabric and the decal are significantly darker than pictured which results in a very difficult to make out t-shirt. I don't really mind it, but for the price you'd think there would've been more thought put into it.",
