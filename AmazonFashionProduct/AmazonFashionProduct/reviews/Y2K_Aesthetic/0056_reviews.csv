Gregory Wallace,Cheap Fabrication,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFKNAYG2MP8I9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQYY8FGG,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 9, 2024",Color: Black and WhiteSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"Large size reviewed. Material is something like polyester and not cotton.  Sleeve and collar ribbing do not lay flat due to wonky stitching.  Image (cat) is a weird iron-on that's made up of a bunch of ""X's"".  Length is nothing like the image.  It is cropped about 3 inches shorter (might be ok if that's your preference).",
