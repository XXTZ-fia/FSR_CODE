2 Dogs R Us,Everyday Purse,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K0TYEX1YAR7G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CY27MTDL,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 19, 2024",Color: A01-red,,"I am of mixed opinions on this purse.  It is a great size with a roomy interior without feeling bulky.  The handle is the right length to easily sling over your shoulder.  On the down side, the material is very shiny and reminds me more of vinyl than leather making it look cheap.  The material also makes it easy to slide off your shoulder.  The pockets in front are on the small side so could be used for change or maybe earbuds, but not big enough to hold a phone.Not my favorite purse but it will work for everyday use and runs to the grocery store.",9
J ✩,Great Product,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GZ87KQO3STH9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CY27MTDL,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 13, 2024",Color: A02-black,Verified Purchase,"Great bag! You get what you pay for. The bag came in a bit deformed but it doesn't take much to whip it back into shape. The material feels very smooth and has a cheap feel but what else do you expect from a $30 bag off of Amazon? Looks exactly like the listing picture, however I don't recommend wearing this with thick outerwear since the straps can be prone to falling off due to its smooth, flexible surface. The bag itself however, is very roomy and is about the size of my 13 inch laptop screen. It also has a small compartment inside the bag in the back to store other materials which I like. I can see myself storing a lot of items in here. Overall, a great purchase.",3
