Elizabeth Zelaya,Did Come Embroidered.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31GI0R19SKOI3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BY6VJBJJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 26, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Blue,,"I adore this jacket. It is a windbreaker, so it is more like a rain jacket than a warm jacket. I deducted one star because this jacket was embroidered with the brand's name on the collarbone side. I decided to cut through all of the yarn and remove it from the jacket because I did not like this. Although the stitching marks are not very noticeable, I do not mind that they were left on the jacket. I did get this jacket in a size up for it to give me an oversized fit. If not, it is pretty true to size, so I would keep this in mind if you want to go for an oversized fit.",

Caleb Jensen,The length is not what it looks like,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TTW3DUEYG8XB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BY6VJBJJ,"1.0 "," the United States "," April 15, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I was pretty shocked when I received my item. I got an extra large when I’m a medium because I wanted it to be way oversize and I was strolling through the photos and the two people in the photos that had the jacket on looked really, cool, so I was really excited and then when I received it, it was cropped, so maybe I should’ve got the XXXL. I know it’s made in China so it’s made smaller but the length is way smaller than what it seems so it’s cropped.",

Zayne,"Decent Sizing, Mediocre Stitching",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21YLI59M8QN9N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BY6VJBJJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 5, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,"If you're looking for the oversized style, I recommend that you size up once or twice from the jacket size that would normally fit you (I'm 5'10"" and would normally wear medium size coats/jackets, but a large helps fit the oversized style, as advertised).  The stitching could've been better, but that's what you get for paying $30~ on a jacket.  Edit: I wanted to come back after wearing it for a few days and give more insight on the jacket: - I recommend that you wash this on delicate settings; however, the stitching is still very prone to coming out. - Contrary to what Cale's five-star review says, this jacket is not soft - it is made of polyester, but not a softer material like cotton. It is, however, very stylish. - The branding/words on the jacket say ""Beijiale"", not ""Pbkabiug"" (not that it matters to me).",5
