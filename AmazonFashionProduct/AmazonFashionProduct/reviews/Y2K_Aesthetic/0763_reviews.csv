I've even paired these with boots and they looked great.",

They are very cute! The blue-green color option is beautiful and gives a stylish and brings back my 90s vibe without looking outdated. They pants themselves run a little large, so I wish I had sized down for a better fit. My regular jean size and my current measurements lined up to their size chart for an XXL but an XL would have fit much better. They don't fall down, but the waist is a bit looser than I'd like. For this style the longer baggier legs is intentional but if you're on the shorter side the length may be a bit excessive for you. Despite this minor sizing issue the overall quality and style are impressive. I plan to purchase more in a smaller size and different colors because they are really great!",

I'm a decent size 15 and I ordered large and found these fit a little tight, but not uncomfortably so.  These are not very low rise, but more mid rise on me and I have plenty of butt that normally pulls up the slack.  Overall, a decent set of jeans that appear well made and washed up great.

Look no more. I ordered these jeans for my wife and she thinks this pair is great. Coming from my wife, who is a little particular about her clothes and who usually does not wear jeans, this is a big compliment. She has a hard time searching for the perfect pair of jeans. She can wear these all day without any issues of heaviness or bother. The fabric is lightweight and breathable.  She loves the jeans style, fit and looks. I ordered light blue for her and she likes the color very much. The salient feature of the jeans that she absolutely loves is the youthful look and fit. It gives her a contemporary appearance and it has a slimming effect on her that she appreciates; most importantly to her, it does not make her look frumpy. She thinks people of any age can wear these jeans without looking out of place in them.  The length is just perfect and these allow her to wear them with sneakers, flats or small heels. She ordered them large and they are a tad loose in the waist (which she has remedied with a belt) which is better for her, but if you prefer really tight jeans then you should perhaps consider a size down. She does not mind a little fold in the thighs and the waist to be a little loose. Be aware that the pockets are not too deep (for example your phone almost do not fit in the back pocket) which is not an issue for her because according to her anything in the pockets make her look bigger. She also says these jeans seem to be well constructed and she thinks she will have them for a number of years. These are certainly not a big brand name like some other jeans, but they have shot to the top of her list when it comes time for her to get another pair.",
Kristen N.,Really Long and Not Super Low Rise,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SS1W69LKND4O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DQYKY412,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: Dark BlueSize: Large,,"Overall, I like these jeans.  They're comfortable. The material is pretty soft for jeans, and they do have the perfect amount of stretch in them.  I ordered the dark blue, and they aren't the same as the picture--which is one of the reasons I only gave them 4 stars. The dark blue is more of a dirty blue, and it doesn't have the variation in it that is shown in the picture. That was pretty disappointing because I hate jeans that look dirty before you ever wear them.  These are labeled as low-rise. I'd say they're more of a mid-rise.  They're also really long--dragging on the ground long. If you are above average height, these will be a good length for you. If you're shorter than 5'7"", these will probably be a little long on you.  I haven't washed these yet, but I think they'll probably shrink some if you dry them. I'm hoping this helps the length.  I'd order these again, but I wouldn't order this wash, and I'd probably size down based on the length and the stretchiness of the waist.",

The AI tried recommending a M to me, but I typically wear a L in bottoms, so I checked their size chart... My waist is 29"" and my hips are 41"", so it really could've gone either way. I decided to order the L, and it fits perfectly. The waistband does come away from my back when I sit or bend over, but when I'm standing/walking, it looks good because it fits just right without squishing my love handles. It does have good/comfortable stretch to it though, so a M likely would've fit me fine, too. The length is amazing - just right for wearing shoes with a little bit of heel on them (I'm 5'6""). I'm so happy with these jeans that I'm thinking of buying more to continue enjoying in future years.",

The reviews are mixed on the rise. Whether they’re “low rise” for you will greatly depend on your body type and torso length. I’m curvy with a short torso and long legs so these are low rise for me but the length isn’t as long as in the pictures. I’m just under 5’7 and the curves take up some real estate as well. Still they break at the shoe so they’re long enough for flats or sneakers. They have a little stretch and the waist fits with no gapping. The material is kind of thin but they still feel like jeans. Standard blue wash.,

I don't mind that so much because seriously, they are COMFORTABLE everywhere, but the very first time I wore them, the back belt loop ripped off the waist, leaving a hole in the fabric behind. I took a look at the other back belt loop, and I think the thread used to sew these is actually stronger than the denim itself. In the third photo, you can see how the bottom of the belt loop is pulling away from the fabric, so I'm pretty sure it's only a matter of time before this one rips, too. I did some quick sewing to mend the hole and reattach the belt loop just below the seam on the waistline (which I'm hoping is a stronger spot), but it's a real shame when something brand new is so flimsy.

In the body of the description on the website it says the pants are high cut. Just so you know, the pants are low cut, the way the pictures show. Regarding color, I got the ""black"" ones. I wouldn't describe them as black, or even faded black. They're more of a faded medium charcoal color. I think the pants are made well and a good quality, probably worth the $40 being charged.
