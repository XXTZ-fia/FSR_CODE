EKnJK,I don't recommend,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EISQ7V1I1JMN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8TDYWS8,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 24, 2024",Size: MediumColor: White,Verified Purchase,"Yeah don't buy this. Terrible quality and not worth the money. The picture looks like the fabric is a different quality than it is. In reality, it's a really thick (not in a good way) and scratchy material. I would also recommend sizing up because the neck part is really tight and thick, and you can kind of tell in the picture if you look hard enough. The print is also standard iron-on. It feels cheap. I can probably still figure out a way to style it but it won't be very easy.",3
