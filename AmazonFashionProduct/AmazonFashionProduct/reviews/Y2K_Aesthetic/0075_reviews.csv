Fritz Krepotkin,"Not the same sweater as photos: fabric is solid color, not heathered, and lesser quality",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38MX0CQO8BG2B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGCZYKHF,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2024",Color: GreenSize: Large,,"I like this InterNos Womens Y2k Ruffled Collar Cardigan very much. At 5'10"", 34DD, 150 lbs, I requested the Large and it fits well: the crop is just right and the sleeves are plenty long. However, I gotta call out nonsense with false product images when I see it--it's maddening and wrong. Attached pics were taken after the first delicate wash and hang dry. The fabrication is decent, but It's clearly not the gorgeous heathered knit shown in the listing--not that i was expecting it from 100% polyester anyway. At time of review, there are no actual product images available to buyers beyond this point. Proceed with caution.",
Mark,Crop Top Sweater,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CKZE4LD8PESY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGCZYKHF,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 10, 2024",Color: GreenSize: Medium,,"My wife likes the crop top style to wear with her wide-leg jeans.  She likes the color, the buttons and the ruffle collar.  Those are all very nice style features.  The polyester fabric actually feels like a wool sweater would feel, somewhat course, but stretchy.  It is true to size and washed up great.",
Vector O.,Super cute sweater,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1330L5K95T9BF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGCZYKHF,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 7, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,,This cardigan is adorable.  Love the ruffled collar. I got a size Large because there wasn’t a larger size offered (XL is my usual selection). Even with it unbuttoned it looks great over a work dress or with a t-shirt and jeans.,
