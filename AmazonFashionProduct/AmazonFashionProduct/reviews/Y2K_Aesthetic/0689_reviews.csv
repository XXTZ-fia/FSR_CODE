DMB Reviews,"Cute, comfortable",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F8W9G2BT9EDX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJD7TMKS,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 13, 2024",Color: BeigeSize: One Size,,I ordered this hat for my wife.  She loves the little bow detail. It is sewn on nicely to the hat.  The hat is a nicely knit hat and seems durable.  The yarn is not as soft as I expected but it’s comfortable and not itchy to wear.  The beige hat with black bow looks nice.  The hat runs a little on the big side but it still fits nicely.  This hat really helps to keep my wife warm in these midwestern winters.,
