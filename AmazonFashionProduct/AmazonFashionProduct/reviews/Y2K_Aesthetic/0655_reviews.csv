Tara H.,Ok,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17HTD5RRNDGR9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C6KT552D,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 20, 2023",,,"Definitely Shein comparable quality, inside has raw edges, it's cute but definitely cheap. I will not be purchasing Amazon clothing as it is extremely overprized in my opinion. Otherwise, the material is soft on the outside and stretchy, it's a cute style. I will be keeping this but wished I hadn't paid so much for it. Will not be purchasing AMAZON CLOTHING again.",3
Vitus,The perfect Y2K off the shoulder blouse,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF30P1BP4GUFK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C6KT552D,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 24, 2023",,,"This blouse is so cute.  It definitely brings me back and reminds me of the off the shoulder blouses I would wear during the holidays back in the early 2000s.  This blouse looks exactly like it does in the pictures and I absolutely love the tiny pearl accent that’s on the fold over neckline.  It’s so cute and dainty.  I also love that the material is slightly fuzzy on the outside because it makes it perfect for that holiday look.  I do wish the fuzzy texture was also on the inside of the blouse, but it’s not.  If you’re ordering this, it does run true to size and will fit snug.  It will probably also show a tiny part of the side of your stomach as well since the bottom hem is cut in an asymmetrical way.  Overall this blouse is super cute and will definitely make you feel so adorable.",5
