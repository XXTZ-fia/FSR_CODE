BritniFowler,The softest sweater!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MVRRG4LPT5X2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCDLG16Y,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 28, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"This quirky sweater is amazing! It is so soft, warm and a bit heavy but in a good way. The fabric feels like real quality! The cat design on the front and back match up great and has gotten a few laughs and a lot of compliments. I would be cautious washing it. Im not sure if it says somewhere how to take care of it, but it fits perfect and I worry about shrinking with this material so I have hang dried mine. Purrr-fect sweater for any cat lover!",
The Squirrel Rehabber,Totally Size Down,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R112ZI5C6AZZ8I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCDLG16Y,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 20, 2023",,,"I’m reviewing a size XS. I’m 5’2 and I weigh 130 lbs. my usual size is a medium. I’m glad I did pick a size extra small. I also added a picture of the back of the sweater just so everybody could see what the back would look like once it was on. It’s very well-made. It’s not itchy at all. It looks really cute with the pair of leggings. But if you want it to fit and not look oversized, I would go down by two sizes. It’s an adorable sweater.",2

remoteControlledCow,Sweater quality is great.  Print is good.  Spelling error on the front.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OIAIW8YJ1M5R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCDLG16Y,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 12, 2023",,,"The sweater itself is great.  It's soft and comfortable.  The Van Gogh print on the sleeve is sewed on, which is great.  Overall, I really like the style.  But the sewed lettering on the front is messy and not very clear - might be a good thing because they misspelled ""Potao Eaters"" (it shows eatArs) which is too bad.  It looks like it says 1883 for Potato eaters - but it should be 1885.",

jennifer Dolezal,Amazing sweater except the arm patch,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11M2MKH9UO21M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCDLG16Y,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2023",,,"THe sweater itself is soft and nice weight. It held up nicely to wash. My teen son loved it, except the patch. I was expecting a nice cloth patch I think, but it is a weird, cheap tarp plastic kind of feel that just doesnt match the vibe of the rest of the garment.  I think he may end up taking off the patch... bummer bc it is a super unique concept.",

Katiedid,Soft and an instant favorite!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCN6NHDGOVRMT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCDLG16Y,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 21, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"Okay, since I've given this to my 15yo kiddo, she's worn it twice in the same week. It's so soft and crazy cute! She loves things that are oversized and cozy, but when they were out of the black cat sweater in large, I took a chance and ordered her size of Medium in it. Win! The Medium sweater is nicely baggy on her, and she can still tuck the front into jeans so it looks neater or changes the outfit. The front and back have different images, of a front and back of the cat, and are well placed and matched proportionately.  The weave used really is so very soft and cuddly, and reminds me of a snuggly hug. It looks more expensive than the price really was, so it was a total win for this mom and her teen!",
Honest Review,It’s cat-tastic!  Comfortable & warm.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36G6KFH9BBSV6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCDLG16Y,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 19, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"We are a cat friendly house and we love anything cat, so of course I’m was going to love this sweater. The sweater itself seems well made, the cat picture looks just like the promotional picture. It’s comfortable & seems warm, but I ordered it for the cat, the comfort and warmth are just nice bonuses. Love that the back of the sweater also has the back of the cat.  I’m 5’11” / 175 and the medium fits well, in fact, I think it’s the correct size for me. However, I could swear I ordered a large because I wanted it to be a little oversized, but I was delivered a medium, and my order shows it was a medium and at the time of this writing a large isn’t even available, so maybe I’m losing my memory… what was I talking about? I could also swear there was a size chart, but now it just shows a conversion chart for women. I could be wrong, just odd. Here’s my point, if you want it to be oversized… size up.",2

The video shows the perfect fit. The knitted material is comfortable and can be worn alone or layered.

I highly recommend Yimoon’s excellent Knitted Long Sleeve Pullover to everyone.",
