These camisoles won't fit Kenneth, and I am sure he won't want to wear them anyways! With this long-winded premise, I found these camisoles fresh easy to wear in Summer. I washed them in the washing machine on a delicate setting and delicate dry, they seem to hold it quite well. These are very casual but overall flattering.",4
Customer,"Plastic like texture, not bad if you don't mind that",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IT4P3SJA0QMI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPSTQH6J,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 8, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Classicas Shown in the Figure,Verified Purchase,"Very plastic like in it's feel but otherwise comfortable, cute, and fits well",
AJG,"Good for the price, but colors not as advertised and straps too long",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R168F1U3PZDFQK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPSTQH6J,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 24, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Classicas Shown in the Figure,Verified Purchase,"For a few bucks a shirt, it's decent. As a small person with a large chest, the tight-fitting shirts are hard to get over the top of my body, but once they're on, they fit pleasantly. The fabric is comfortable. The two main issues I have are: 1. The straps are not adjustable. They fit kind of okayish on me if I adjust enough, but they are definitely too long, and the shirts keep slipping down about an inch or two past my bra. I don't care about that in most casual situations, but there are other times when I simply don't need to flash everyone my bra. If I keep pulling my shirt up throughout the day, it's doable, but it's not ideal, and I could see this being an even bigger issue for people with different comfort levels and/or bodies. 2. I chose this listing over others specifically because I was excited about the darkish green shirt included in the package. However, it's more of a sickly pale olive than the army green shown in the product images. It's almost the same color as the light gray, but with a slight greenish tint. It's kind of ugly and neither what I was hoping for nor something I would have wanted to purchase had I seen its actual color. The shades of some other colors are slightly off, though none as much as the green. About six of the shirts will probably get worn, so it's still worth the money for me overall, but it loses a star for misleading advertising, because I was looking forward to that green shirt, and another one for the strap annoyance.",2
