Larry T.,Love love love these!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GRU8DWQX7EJS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D269J7GH,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 28, 2025",Color: Heather Grey Short-sleeved SetSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love this set of clothing! The top is cute and the bottoms have the yoga top at the waist.. they do not shrink enough to have to return them or to not wear them, even with high heat in the dryer though it’s not suggested.. I tried just in case, cause they fit so well originally. I went back and bought another in another color. I will buy these again. Going in my favorites list. I’m 5’8” and 160 size large and they fit Like a dream!",
Amazon Customer,super comfy- size down!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JIO77NIVY3O5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D269J7GH,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 28, 2025",Color: Heather Grey Short-sleeved SetSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I love this set! I normally wear a size L (I am a true size L in pretty much everything) but I sized down to a M and it fits great. I did have to wash it basically right out of the package because of the smell but I tried it on before and after washing and it retained its fit. However I did NOT put it in the dryer; I think if I did, it definitely would have shrunk, so this is just one of those sets that has to be air dried. As others mentioned the material is quite thin so it will definitely show panty lines if you wear normal underwear with it; but overall I am very happy with this!",
