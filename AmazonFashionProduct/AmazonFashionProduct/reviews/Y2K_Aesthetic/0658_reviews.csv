I was hoping for a more ""cotton-like"" feel to the material, but it's definitely an acrylic blend.  This doesn't detract from the quality and the looks of the sweater, however.  It still has a very soft feel, with a little bit of stretch to it, and it looks great for wintertime streetwear layered over a tee.",
