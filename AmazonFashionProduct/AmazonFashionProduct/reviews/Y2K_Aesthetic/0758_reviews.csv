My 15-year-old daughter wanted this ""aesthetic tank"" (she loves the word ""aesthetic""). It has its good qualities, with some criticisms.  The fabric is sort of OK. If you're looking for a long-term top, for several seasons, I am afraid this one will probably not work. But if you have a teen, or if you just needs something for maybe 2 seasonal cycles, I think this works all right. The feel is soft enough, with a decent stretch. But the fabric itself, and the stitching, feel kind of fragile. After washing/drying a few times, I can see some fraying.  The sizing is a bit smaller than what's stated in the product description. My daughter is fine with this, because she prefers a tighter fit anyway. But it's very close to not being right, and depending on what you like it might be of by almost a full size.  The ""invisible"" idea actually does work well. Not perfectly, of course, but it does pretty much disappear against your shoulders.  This is an OK shirt, with a tight fit, and a decent ""invisible"" element.",
