Very comfy as well.  It is quite oversized like most of their shirts, so likely best to size down a size or 2 from your normal depending on the type of fit you want—personally I have to get their smallest (XS if applicable) when I wear a M/L on average or their oversize line swallows me.  Will most definitly be getting their red color of this shirt next.",2
