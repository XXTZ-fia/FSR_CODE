Tracisgoodfellow,Beautiful hoodie! Bigger and thicker than I thought it would be!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25VHN4LJMA8B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C789FGW7,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 27, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"Sorry for the wrinkles on the hoodie, I was very excited to get this and wasted no time putting it on the minute I received it lol I love this hoodie! I am 5'3 and 130-135 lbs, small boobs (32 B), with small shoulders, small waist, wide hips, and big booty for reference lol I ordered the light blue in X-Large because I wanted an oversized fit and because I saw many reviews saying it runs small. But I have to say, mine seems to fit as a true X-Large to me! I love that the sleeves are long and cover my hands, to give it that cozy feel, and very important to me when looking for oversized hoodies! Also, it is alot thicker and warmer inside than I thought it would be, I started sweating while I was taking these pictures, but it was a hot day! I wouldn't say that the material is super stretchy, unfortunately. It's not stiff but I did find that the material isn't as stretchy as my other oversized hoodie that is made of 50% cotton and 50% polyester. This hoodie says it's made of 65% polyester and only 35% cotton, so I suppose that's why. So it was kind of difficult to pull the sleeves up when I needed them out of my way, but not a deal breaker. The only other thing is the color is not quite as dark of a blue as in the pictures on Amazon (I took pictures in different lighting and with no filters for you to see what it looks like). The last thing is that the drawstrings are CRAZY and unnecessarily long 😅 but it's alright, I don't care that much about that feature. Also, maybe its just me, but I felt the hoodie was a little small and funny looking. But regardless of those minor things, I love this hoodie and would recommend it!",4
