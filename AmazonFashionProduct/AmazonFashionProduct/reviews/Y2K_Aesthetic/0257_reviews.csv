The white fabric provides a nice contrast to the design, and the slim fit is flattering without being too tight. The material is on the thinner side, but it works well for layering.",

They cover most of my hand. And being that they flare out there's really no way to roll them up. The shirt is soft and comfortable though.",

Tosha Testerman,Odd neckline,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7C9MKTLN9H8D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC6K66JW,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2024",Color: GreySize: Medium,,"This top is comfortable. It is made of a soft, stretchy, ribbed material that sits nicely over the body. It has a good length and long sleeves that are perfect if you're looking for that grungy look. The design is also cute and the shirt feels like it is of good quality. My only issue is with the neckline. It sits very weird. Like a broad v-neck that wishes is was a square neck but is really a crew neck that someone tried to alter to create a v-neck after the fact. No amount of adjusting the shirt fixes this either, its just weird. The top is still wearable but I don't know how long it can be worn before the odd neckline annoys me enough to throw it in the back of my closet, never to be seen again. It really is a shame because the rest of the top is pretty much perfect and I am saddened that the neckline just isn't made well. It sort of ruins the whole thing really.",
jlt0518,Cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RQLREMD4A9FQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC6K66JW,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 28, 2024",Color: GreySize: Large,,This is a really cute top. I love the design and details especially up the sleeves. The neck is a little weird as it's cut very wide but not quite enough to go off shoulder. It runs a little small so consider ordering up.,
V review,Cute Y2K Shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NXOT5Y3YUCAZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC6K66JW,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 27, 2024",Color: WhiteSize: Small,,I’m in love with the Long Sleeve Grunge Tee! The vintage graphic and gothic design perfectly captures the Y2K aesthetic while remaining stylishly slim fit. It’s a must-have for any grunge or fairycore enthusiast looking to elevate their wardrobe!,
Neodymium Bean,Really shiny and synthetic looking with an Ed Hardy aeshetic.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QWPU8SZMQD87/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC6K66JW,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 24, 2024",Color: Dark BrownSize: X-Large,,"Shirt fits great and has that early 2000's Ed Hardy's look.  The Shirt is made with a reflective material and looks very synthetic and shiny.  If you are looking for a cotton shirt you will probably not like this shirt.  If you don't mind a polyester rayon type look and feel, this shirt is pretty cool and looks great.  It does that sleeve over your hand things that's super comfy :)",
