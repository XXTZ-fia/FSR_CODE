This is a nice sweater for the price, and the seller provides EXCELLENT customer service.  I ordered the green one because it would go with many things I own which are the same color. Unfortunately, the green is so dark it really looks like charcoal grey, and the light grey stripe is like sweatshirt color grey.  Also, unlike some of the pictures left in reviews, the sweater I received is not nearly as fuzzy.  It is just very slightly fuzzy. It is a nice medium weight and true to size.  Perhaps in another color I would have been happy with it, but I feel I just got shades of grey.",

Here's why I'm absolutely loving it:  First and foremost, let's talk about style. The Y2K-inspired color-block design and striped pattern give this cardigan a trendy and retro vibe that instantly elevates any outfit. Whether I'm pairing it with jeans and a basic tee for a casual look or layering it over a dress for a more polished ensemble, this sweater adds a fun and fashionable touch to my wardrobe.  The V-neckline and button-down front add versatility to the design, allowing me to wear it open for a relaxed and effortless vibe or buttoned up for a more tailored and structured look. The buttons are securely attached and easy to fasten, ensuring that the cardigan stays in place throughout the day.  Comfort is another standout feature of this sweater. Made from a soft and lightweight knit fabric, it feels incredibly cozy and comfortable against my skin. The relaxed fit and slightly oversized silhouette provide ample room for movement, making it perfect for all-day wear.  I also appreciate the quality of craftsmanship that went into this sweater. The seams are well-constructed, and the fabric is durable and resistant to pilling, ensuring that this cardigan will hold up well to regular wear and washing.  One of the things I love most about this cardigan is its versatility. It's the perfect layering piece for transitioning between seasons, providing just the right amount of warmth without feeling too bulky or heavy. Plus, the classic color-block design makes it easy to mix and match with other pieces in my wardrobe.  Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Bakyarder Women's Y2K Color-Block Striped Cardigan Sweater. It combines style, comfort, and versatility in a way that few other sweaters do, making it a true wardrobe staple. If you're looking for a trendy and cozy cardigan to add to your collection, look no further than this one. It's sure to become your new favorite sweater, just like it has for me!",
