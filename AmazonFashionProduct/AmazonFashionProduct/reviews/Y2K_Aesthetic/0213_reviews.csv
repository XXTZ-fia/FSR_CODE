Rob Rob,Cute but slips easily,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YPOR4D6F35KU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D66SNJBR,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 21, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Orange,,This is super cute and fits well but also slips down super easily so just be careful. Otherwise the design is gorgeous and the fit is perfect. I totally recommend!,
Quiche,so cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4NVI9P50O4NU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D66SNJBR,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 15, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Orange,,"this top is literally sooo cute and comfortable, the material is so nice",
Khristen,Not my favorite…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBHP1A4VC3GII/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D66SNJBR,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 5, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Orange,,"The fit wasn’t very flattering on me, I’m not sure if this wasn’t designed for big chests or if it’s simply a design flaw. The material is okay, it’s soft, pretty thin, but not the worst. I will say the flower design is very pretty and perfect for summer. Probably best for gals with smaller chests.",
Doris B,Cute but not for everyone,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DNP75TFMSRC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D66SNJBR,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 28, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Orange,,This is a very cute top to wear to go out. The down side is it is not for girls with big breast unless you have a great strapless bra with support.,
Georgine,"Floral, Trendy Tube Top",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQLV5U79XFOOV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D66SNJBR,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 27, 2024",,,"I wanted a summery top with a big floral print on it (big flower prints are so popular lately), and this top checked all my boxes. What I love most is the mesh layer (with the flower print on both sides!) If it was just the flower print directly on the black tube top, the quality might be downgraded a little.  The size of the tube top is perfect too. It is not too small and tiny. It is just the right amount of cropped. It shows a decent amount of stomach.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase and can't wait to wear it frequently! I highly recommend this top. It is a great trending piece.",
Tee,Floral bandeau,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20O8OKUOL5YWB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D66SNJBR,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 24, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Orange,,If I could order this top in xs I would. Idk how I managed to order a medium because it’s too big for me. I will more than likely just rip the seams and alter it smaller. I love the floral print on the tanish yellow faded background. The top is thin on polyester but who cares. It’s cute. It’s the summer. Us girls just want to look cute and have fun.,
Reine Soleil,Very cute but runs small and the fabric is thin,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP1BMHMQNPQVV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D66SNJBR,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 17, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Orange,,"The design on the fabric is so pretty. I am not usually a big fan of floral prints as they tend to be busy but this is nice and tasteful.  What I don't like is that the fabric is super thin and doesn't have much of a stretch. It runs very small so this large is barely the size of a medium (a normal US size 8 medium).  I will let my niece wear it because there is no way I can squeeze myself into it. Otherwise it will have to be worn on the beach only with something under because when stretched it is basically see-through.  My exact rating for this would be a 3.4 and unfortunately the stars don't allow for that. I can't give it a 3 stars either because it is pretty enough to be a little above. But I don't find it to be a great value either.  So here is the real verdict. If someone gave this to me, I would like it and not care how much it costs or that the quality is not that great because I would assume they know that I love tube tops, adore tiger lilies and picked this just for me. If I had to buy it myself. I may return it.",
Obey,Tube top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OZ81YRFUS3TL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D66SNJBR,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 17, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Rosy,,It’s so soft and comfy. It’s fit perfectly to my granddaughter. The design is very nice. The color is beautiful. It’s light and stretchy too. Price is cheap. Great product and highly recommend it!,
C. Fleming,Cute & well made,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MCJUKDVCKW8M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D66SNJBR,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 13, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Orange,,"This is a very cute and nice quality tube top.  It has a super cute & secure elastic neckline/bodice that is very flattering and I like that the elastic is soft but strong for a perfect fit & stays up.  It is a very smooth and soft fabric that is stretchy and breathable.  It washes well with no shrinking, warping or loss of softness.  I love it.",
