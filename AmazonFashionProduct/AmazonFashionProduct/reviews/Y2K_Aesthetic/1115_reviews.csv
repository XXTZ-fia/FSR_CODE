They are fine pants they look nice and they are not totally uncomfortable (although they do feel a bit like snow pants) they were exactly what I had expected given the price, but now I’m wearing them again after having them packed away for several months and I have gotten progressively more frustrated throughout the day with these pockets… they are the weirdest most difficult pockets I have ever seen. They are open there is no button or zipper, but it’s almost like the opening to the pocket is smaller then the actual pocket or something, but once you put your phone in there let me tell you it’s a whole battle to get it back out. I mean they are still fine pants and I will probably still wear them and just be frustrated each time I put something in my pocket, but I thought I’d still share with you all as you have a right to know.",8

They also have a string to cuff the bottoms if you'd like, so you're getting good quality for the price.
