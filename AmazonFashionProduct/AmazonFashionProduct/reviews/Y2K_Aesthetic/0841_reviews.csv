He loves the vintage, aesthetic design, and the dark red color is just perfect. The knitted fabric is soft but warm, making it comfortable to wear all day. The long sleeves and crewneck style give it a cool, retro vibe, and the striped pattern adds a bit of extra flair.  It’s got a bit of that grunge look, which he’s really into, and it pairs well with a lot of different outfits. Overall, it’s a great sweater that’s stylish, comfy, and perfect for layering or wearing on its own. My son can’t get enough of it!",

B.Olive,Cute mens sweater,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YDUA7EQBTKG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFM36MR4,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 27, 2024",Color: C ShadowSize: Medium,,"I was looking for a sweater like this for my son , and was happy to get a chance to review this one. I got a medium, and he normally wears a small, so this is a bit oversized on him,. It looks really nice on him. I think oversized is better with this one. It's fuzzy, like mohair, but not excessively so- just a soft looking, fuzzy, cute, look. The colors are understated and go with anything. Looks great with baggy denim and nice sneakers or ankle boots. Nice quality.",
RL Aspuria,Retro Baggy Look,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ST2T1ASJQNB2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFM36MR4,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2024",Color: B KhakiSize: XX-Large,,"Looking to get back into retro 90s wear, this baggy sweater is warm, the fabric comfortable, and soft, and overall solid look.

Emily Simpson,I would give this 10 stars if I could,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GKMU7TMVWAOE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFM36MR4,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 22, 2024",Color: B PurpleSize: XX-Large,,"This sweater is EVERYTHING. it's so thick! It's beautifully colored. It's so insanely incredibly perfectly buttery soft. It'll wrap you up in the best warmest hug. It's a little grungy looking, so I call it the ""Kurt Cobain sweater"". It's oversized so the sleeves go a little down into your hands. Everyone in my family tried to take this off of me at first but now they no better. I will not share it. Buy this. You will not regret it.",
Review Vine,Soft but does shed a bit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUFNW4WXHPA3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFM36MR4,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 6, 2024",Color: C ShadowSize: X-Large,,"This sweater is incredibly soft to be 100% polyester. It's a nice, thick weight that will be perfect for New England winters. I ordered an XL for my 6'2"" / 170 lbs. son.  It's a great length on him (28"" from shoulder to bottom cuff) and the sleeves reach just past his wrists. The pattern is nice and even and there were no pulls, rips, or pilling. There was quite a bit of shedding out of the bag and through his first wear. I'll be interested to see after repeated washings if this is an issue. It's minor and only a slight inconvenience, but should be noted. Overall though we are both pleased with the look, fit, and style.",2
