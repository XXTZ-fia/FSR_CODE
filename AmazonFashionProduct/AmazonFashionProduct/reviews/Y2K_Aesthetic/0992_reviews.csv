It dangles from a pink heart-shaped keychain clasp and is accompanied by several dangling items such as a little white and pink strawberry and silver bow. I would think that pretty much every little girl in the world would love this, and cat lovers of any age will likely get a smile from it as well. It can be used as a keychain (though I wouldn't personally do that myself, I'd be too worried about the little pieces getting snagged and broken) or as a decorative item hung from any number of various posts or places. It would look really nice on a bracelet as well, or a purse zipper. I could also imagine it being used in various charms and art projects. It's a really cute, really sweet little item that could be used for all kinds of different purposes. Adorable and affordable!",
