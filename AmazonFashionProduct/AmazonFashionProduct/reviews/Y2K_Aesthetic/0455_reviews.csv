Sizing up a size or two is a good idea if you're wanting it to be oversized. The main thing I do want to say is that if you have a bigger chest the sweater-vest will end up giving a low in the back high in the front look. If you are flatter then it may be a different story, but I can't say. Overall though, I really like the thickness and I think the design is cute! The brand just may need to consider that if they're selling a women's sweater-vest then they may need to consider that our chests should factor into the design a bit more.",
