A. Cooper,Durable Crevice Clean Brush,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I1HQWXRMTEM9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9H27XPH,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Color: Black/WhiteNumber of Items: 3,,I got this cleaning brush for my floors at the office.  The grout is getting to be a sore eye to look at.  These are good for small projects or something on your wall or back splash in your kitchen or bar area.  This is a good item and a good deal for the price.,

K. Sun,Good for cleaning out paver cracks,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30IGIOZLPKST/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9H27XPH,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 19, 2024",Color: Black/WhiteNumber of Items: 3,,I use the black version to clean out old polymeric sand and debris from between driveway pavers. It fits in the space easily and isn't too aggressive - old crumbling poly sand and accumulated dirt is brushed out easily but poly sand that is still hard isn't abraded away too much.  My only disappointments are that the black bristles are starting too deform (I'm probably putting too much demands on this) and that the wire brush has crimped bristles instead of straight ones - this makes it too difficult to fit in between pavers.,
RSF,"Good brushes, a little small",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TCOWT1TGT511/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9H27XPH,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 10, 2024",Color: Black/WhiteNumber of Items: 3,,"This is a review of the ""KMOSENIA Crevice Cleaning Brush"". The package includes three brushes - white, black, and metal. I can't really tell the difference between the white and black bristles. The metal is serious, though - it's thick and sharp and will scrape the heck out of anything you apply it to. The handles are just a tiny bit small for my adult-sized male hand, and the bristles are very narrow. That said, they do seem to work well. I unexpectedly found an application in cleaning the tops of my baseboards, which are very hard to clean otherwise. They also work well for shower grout. For the baseboards alone I'm happy with this purchase.",
Optimus8,Good gap brush,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V59FA7M1L9AX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9H27XPH,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 6, 2024",Color: Black/WhiteNumber of Items: 3,,"Very good gap brushes, used one to clean the rails on the garage door and it worked great. The brushes are a little smaller than I expected and they have a very sturdy handle. I can't tell a real difference between the black and white bristled brushes. They feel very similar to me but the stiffness is enough to fit most needs. The steel brush feels stiff enough to use on rusted areas. Overall very good gap brush.",
Phinix9,"well made, working great",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IP21OPYJO93L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9H27XPH,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 6, 2024",Color: Black/WhiteNumber of Items: 3,,"this Cleaning Brush, Gap Cleaning Brush Set is well make, working great.",
Lisa B.,Smaller than other brands I've ordered,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R157MJY41O0ZNB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9H27XPH,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 5, 2024",Color: Black/WhiteNumber of Items: 3,,When I ordered the Crevice Cleaning Brushes I did not note the size because they all look to be the same size in the pictures but these are smaller than others I've ordered so be aware. The very stiff brush is a metal very coarse brush that might work on tile grout but very little else for my needs. Overall I was disappointed with this product and would order elsewhere in the future.,
Blue Moon in CA,"Great set, strong handle",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNWHPTH7AW5N9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9H27XPH,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 1, 2024",Color: Black/WhiteNumber of Items: 3,,"I had one of these, and the thin handle broke in half, so I needed another one. I saw this 3-brush set, with the sturdy handles, and knew this was what I had to have. You can see how well the handle fits in my hand, so I expect this to last much longer.  It also includes a wire brush (which I could have used last week!), so I'm happy to have that now as well. And the other two are different colors, so it can help you to keep track of different areas or items you want to use them on. All in all, great set to have around for all kinds of cleaning tasks.",
Katie,Amazing!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EGHSIJ1KFV5Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9H27XPH,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 1, 2024",Color: Black/WhiteNumber of Items: 3,,"I love these crevice cleaning brushes! They work so well in those tight nooks and crannies especially in the kitchen when you’re cleaning! They work well at getting crumbs and food particles stuck in between the stove and the counter, these ones hold up well too and are easy to grip and hold!",
