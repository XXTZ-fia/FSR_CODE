It was it maybe 🤔,Perfect size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OORMSJ4JF780/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4DV3GLS,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 7, 2024",Color: KhakiSize: One Size,Verified Purchase,I thought it looked a little too small and won't be able to fit the things I need but it has plenty of space and I love how easy it is to adjust the straps. The color is beautiful and fits with everything I wear. The zipper does get caught in the inside once in a while and can be a little annoying to undo. It can get pretty heavy if you put a laptop or a lot of stuff in there. But the durability is great have no problems with it.,

Very adjustable.  Roomy inside. If I had any complaints it would be that I wish it had a zipper pocket in the back.  But, the one in front is large and there is a smaller one inside, along with two slotted pockets for keys & stuff.  Like the sturdiness and canvas material.  It's a nice change from my leather bags.
