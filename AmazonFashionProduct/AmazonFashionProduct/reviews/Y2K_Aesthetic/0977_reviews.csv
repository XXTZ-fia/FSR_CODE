Georgine,"Cute Design, Average Material",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZUMOPN9801MR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CXTG65ZN,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 13, 2024",,,"I thought that this shirt's print was very cute and reminded me of other trendy graphic baby tees. However, when it arrived, I immediately noticed the faintness in the shirt. But, when I tried it on, it was very obviously thin and a little see-through.  Also, the material is not the type that really stretches. It's not necessarily comfortable, nor does the design show nicely. Despite these issues, the shirt has potential because of its cute print and trendy style.  If you can get through the slight discomfort and don't care about the see through material, then this shirt will be alright.",

I know it’s a baby tee but I ordered a size up so it wasn’t as tight as I thought but it was still crazy small and not flattering at all. The quality is worth it for the price but honestly would not recommend. If you are a small and don’t want that really tight fit you would have to size up to an XL.,
Julie,"Cheap, Poor Print Job",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R41I6SDY9K7CM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CXTG65ZN,"1.0 "," the United States "," June 21, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Shells White,Verified Purchase,I knew the reviews weren’t remarkable on this shirt but some of the other photos in reviews at least looked like a decent print job. The seashells are poor quality graphic printed on. The t shirt is really cheap material and see through. Seems like the type of fabric that will easily pill once worn. Overall disappointing and definitely do not recommend purchasing.,4

It's just a shirt with random imagery, or what the seller calls ""vintage aesthetic."" That means something, because my 15-year-old daughter wanted it, likes it, and she wears it a lot now.  The material is basic, but soft. It's good enough quality that the fit, color, and decal all have held up perfectly even after numerous wash/dry cycles.  The fit is perhaps just a bit on the small side. Looking at the product photos, I don't think it is intended to be smallish.  My daughter has fun with this shirt, and she wears it to school and out with friends. I recommend it.",

The martini graphic is just as vibrant and adorable as shown in the photo. The image does have a plasticy glossy look to it, but personally, I don't mind.
