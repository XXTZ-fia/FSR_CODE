Size up!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39QHCX7WUJJLO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5V8LKD4,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Green B,,"I love how cozy this sweater feels! The material is a comfort knit material. The sweater is very light weight and soft. I love how the sleeves fit with a slight bubble effect at the wrist. I am so glad I sized up two sizes so it fit very loose, but the collar is very wide and it slips off the shoulder.",

Sara Pedroza,Cozy Sweater,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H0HTUJ9M6G5M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5V8LKD4,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 2, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Blue B,Verified Purchase,"I rated this a 4 because my daughter loves it. However, putting it through the wash made the quality poorer. It started getting those fuzz balls on the sweater already. Size runs true to what is normal.",

It is nicely made. The sweater is super soft and comfortable. It is oversized so the fit is a little loose and blousy, but looks great on. The pink colors are amazing. Love the style, especially how it sits at the neck. Definitely recommend!",

Amanda Jackson,The new black & blue/white & gold dress?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BD1FLEKINW78/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5V8LKD4,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 31, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Coral Red B,Verified Purchase,"Ordered the coral striped sweater, and it looks to be white and coral striped in the item photos. It is actually coral and an uglyyy shade of green, which is hard to capture in the photo. If I squint at the photos I can kindaaa see the green now (like the famous dress debate), but it’s still extremely misleading. Also, I will admit it is soft, but weirdly short. And the sizing is off. I ordered it larger but it didn’t seem to actually run oversized. I needed it for a Halloween costume, but I needed white and orange stripes, so I’m returning it.",5
TAD,Cute and Warmish,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JGHN4KR6LUYN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5V8LKD4,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 24, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Blue B,Verified Purchase,"It looks great, and is soft and warm(ish). Fits as desired, which for me means loosely. For people with sensitivity to fabrics, this sweater is not scratchy at all, and there was no unpleasant odor. I ordered another one in a different color on the basis of this one. I have yet to wash it, so there might be a follow up...",
Amanda B.,length is horrible,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWP3YCDTVUGJN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5V8LKD4,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 22, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Blue B,Verified Purchase,"Neckline is super weird, it folds over because there's no seam or clear indication between the front and back of the sweater. The sleeves are cute and oversized like I had hoped but the sweater length is super short. I'm usually a medium in knit sweaters but I sized up to an XL for an extra oversized fit for fall and it's still way too short. I was hoping that it hit mid thigh but it hits right at my gut. It is stretchy, but the length doesn't stretch, only the width so it looks wider, not longer. I don't think sizing up more would do any good My sister has a similar sweater (NOT this one) but it's too long for her but this one is the right fit so she and I are switching, which is the only reason why I'm not returning it.",2
Rhonda,sooo cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GLNTHU3X050I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5V8LKD4,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 27, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Blue B,Verified Purchase,this sweater is so comfy and cute it's a little shorter than i expected but 100% worth the buy,6
