Tiffany Thompson,Tube top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I271BZZWPJ3N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC9KMD4W,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Color: GoldenSize: Small,,"Super ute tube top, the print and color are really pretty, the only things I didn't like were the sizing and material. The sizing runs a little big, i'm usually an XS but it fit more like a S/M so I would size down. The material is very thin and I got the yellow one which is completely see through. Im not sure how the other characters are though.",

The chest is larger so this will work well if you are ample in the bust area.",

SeeingReddd,So cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12KWR2Q2M17D7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC9KMD4W,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Color: RosySize: Small,,Love this tube top. Fits very true to size! For reference I am 5’3 120lbs and got a size small. It’s not too stretchy. It fits super snug and snatches you up. The color is also super flattering and perfect for summer! 💗,

ErikaShanice,Cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OJJM0R39K3EH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC9KMD4W,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 7, 2024",Color: GoldenSize: Small,,Design is exactly as described. Super lightweight and a tad bit transparent. Go for a snug fit so it can hold up nicely around the breast. There’s no rubber support to help you along the stitching line otherwise. Other than that it’s cute!,
Jen D,Summer crop top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NBMOEEDMKT6B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC9KMD4W,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 3, 2024",Color: RosySize: Small,,"I’m 34 and know I’m past the usual “crop top age,” but I still wear them occasionally. I’m not into the high rise pants look, so I usually layer a tank or something underneath to cover below the hips—just my style! The design of this crop top is cute, and the fit is great. It’s stretchy, and the small works perfectly for me, even with a layer underneath. A cute and versatile summer top.",
