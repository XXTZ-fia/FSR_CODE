They are adjustable so I will switch it around depending on my mood.  The rings themselves aren't high quality, but they were reasonably priced so I wasn't expecting much.  Some designs are better than others, so I pick and choose my favorites.  These are best for little girls or small fingers.  I found that if they need to be adjusted larger, it kind of pinches the skin between.  The rings are a little heavier than I'm used to and aren't comfortable enough to wear for days at a time, but it's a cute set for the occasion change in my jewelry.  My teenage daughter has borrowed a few to also wear and she loves them because it's stylish, she says.",3
