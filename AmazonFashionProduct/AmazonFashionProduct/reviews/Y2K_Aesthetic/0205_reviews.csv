I bought a large, but it fits like an extra small. The torso is very cropped, like, up to my belly button/way above my hips. The sleeves are pretty baggy compared to the torso, and are also pretty short—fitting like a medium. The color is pretty true to the photo though!! It’s pretty soft, but you can also just tell the material is a bit cheap, but that’s expected.. It’s not a heavy sweater though. If you wear it in the winter, you’d want to layer up. But if you wear it during the autumn or spring, then you’d be warm enough.",

Even if it’s oversized or whatever type of body size you would have, it won’t have that type of oversized look in the producers picture Other than that it’s cute and comfy and came without any rips, so you can buy it for a small child.",4

Definitely worth like $12 on SHEIN, but I wouldn’t buy it for $30. It looks like the photo, but it feels pretty bad. It’s thick, but itchy and not cute knit. From afar it’s fine, but up close it shows how cheaply made it is. Also, the sizing for the body is accurate but the sleeves are weirdly narrow for how wide the body is. Looking back on the product image, the sleeves are narrow for the body, so I guess it’s not necessarily a misleading image. But it was a little disappointing. All around not bad, but you could find something better.",6

It was not oversized at all - went up in size even for an extra grunge/baggy look and a large fit and looked smaller than an XXS….  If you want the grunge baggy look - DO NOT BUY. If you want a tight sweater go for it - if still go up in a size or two… neck was tight and higher then the picture. Bottom of the shirt also was a tight band vs the loose hanging the picture shows :/:/  I would NOT recommend. The sweater was not even close to true based on the picture and reviews I saw.,
