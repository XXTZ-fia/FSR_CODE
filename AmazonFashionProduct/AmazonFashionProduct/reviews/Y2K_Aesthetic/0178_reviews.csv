I typically were a large and ordered a large. Because of the lacy of stretch, the lack of accommodation in the leg to crotch area didn't give off the high waist look.  I have seen women wear them the way they look on me, but ai just wouldn't. I took no picture- no need to embarrass myself. I like my clothing loose. This was loose in some places and tight in others.  These would look best on skinny people anyhow. The proportions need to be adjusted for people with a booty or big legs and a small waist.",

They can be worn low-waisted or mid-rise, whichever works/fits better - and they can be styled with a variety of tops for that urban streetwear look. My daughter is 5’8 and often finds it difficult to get pants that are long enough. She says these are the perfect length and aren’t too short or too long.

I also tried these jeans on with a cozy sweater and it just looks so good, you can even tuck the front into the jeans. I love that. These do not sit low on the waist and I also love the baggy look that these have. You can wear these with flip-flops or tennis shoes, so many possibilities. But trust me, get the jeans!

I was able to snap it back on and it's loose, not sure if that's how it was originally or if this will even hold up. Hopefully they do. This is definitely reminding me of the 90's and JNCO's!",

The fabric is a traditional denim. I like the high waist. The legs really are wide, from the hips all the way down. I've tried other ""wide leg"" jeans that really just fit like straight leg jeans -- snug in the thighs and then straight down from the knees. I suppose if you are super skinny, they would look like wide legs, but not otherwise. These really are wide leg. They look right up to the minute.  What I don't like is that they have absolutely no stretch to them. They say they have 10% polyester in them, with 90% cotton. But usually jeans with that much polyester have a stretch to them. That's why I normally buy my jeans a size or two smaller than regular trousers. I don't like them to be baggy in the butt or wide in the waist.  I went by the size chart for these and ordered a medium. I'm usually between a medium and a large and always order the smaller in jeans. My dimensions are almost exactly what the size chart says for a medium, although my hips are an inch or so bigger. I figured the stretch would take care of that. Yikes! No. Because they have no stretch I struggled to pull them on and could barely zip the zipper. Once I squeezed myself into them, they looked great from the front, but flattened my butt considerably. That's not good! And there is no way I can sit down in them (if I want to breath) or bend over.  So if you are in the fence, order the bigger size. I'm hoping my pair will eventually stretch enough that I can wear them and breath. I'm afraid to wash them and will never put them in the drier.",
