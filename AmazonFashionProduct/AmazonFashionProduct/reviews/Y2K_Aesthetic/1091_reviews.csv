NoFearFiona,"Great style and fabric, wrong color",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8K4L5V8CF877/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB9MR3VD,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 28, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Star Brown,Verified Purchase,"Great shirt!, Fabric very soft design fabulous. However, the brown is not a deep brown as shown in the picture, it is a much lighter sort of milk, chocolate brown.",
Diane R Restrepo,Disappointing - NOT A SWEATSHIRT,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ENJTUNSQXQTU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB9MR3VD,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Star Red White,Verified Purchase,This is basically a long sleeve T-shirt with appliqué sewn on to it. The stars and the trim are of a very cheap material. None of this is as promised. The picture looks like a fleece sweatshirt and that is definitely not what you get. It’s very thin and flimsy and not cozy at all. It looks and feels cheap.,
Wen L Joyce,Cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSC32W4NY90WK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB9MR3VD,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 20, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Y Orange Gray,Verified Purchase,This sweatshirt is so cute and fits so nice. I got a medium (usually a small) for the over sized fit and it’s perfect!,
Tanner Flowers,Really cute top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQYLRN0K7H4R0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB9MR3VD,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 28, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Star Blue White,,This top is a really fp dupe! It fits oversized. I ordered my true size and it fits good. Washes well. Will need to steam or iron due to the edges flaring up on the seams and the stars.,2
AmyInLancaster,Fun top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYF42G78TN34L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB9MR3VD,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 22, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Star Blue White,,"I like this shirt a lot more than I thought I would - easy fit and nicely made, this washes up nicely with no colors running. All the ""raw hems"" are stitched as well so it won't get ragged. Shrank just a little so it's not quite as boxy which is fine.  I typically wear a medium but I ordered a small and it fits fine; if you want a looser more casual fit, go with your regular size. This is not a fleece sweatshirt - it's a long-sleeve heavy cotton  t-shirt which is perfect for me.  Really cute and comfortable!",
