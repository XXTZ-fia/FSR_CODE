Gina Fox,Good FP Dupe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Y5RG5ZCB43PX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7W2CXQW,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2025",Color: Light GreySize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"Great price, not too thick or thin, very comfortable.  Looks and fits great. Sizes up for better oversized fit. Color and style are good. The green numbers are a little plastic-like, but not shiny or very noticeable. Washed several times and it is still in great shape!",

May,Not the exact same as Free People,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5UEC6UNK77SB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7W2CXQW,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 18, 2024",Color: Brown StarSize: X-Large,,It is not the exact same. I have the actual New York pull-over by Free People in the size XL and that thing was oversized and it was amazing! I ordered the apricot bison one and the material is great but it is not as over-sized especially since I did purchase the XL. It fits perfectly just not oversized. Not terrible but ofc much rather have the Free People but not a terrible dupe.,2

I have to pay for shipping to return/exchange this item even though I’m a Prime member. Not worth the cost given the price of the sweatshirt. If I’d known this I wouldn’t have risked it by ordering.",3
