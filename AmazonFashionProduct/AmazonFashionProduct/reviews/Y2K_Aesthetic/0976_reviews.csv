I wouldn’t be surprised if this product was made in some kind of sweatshop situation. It is very itchy, smells of rubber latex like a halloween mask, and is visibly dirty. I didn’t even realize that the product shown in the picture had a lace camisole, and the one lazily attached to the shirt is nothing even remotely similar to the image.

I used them to tighten the shirt up a bit so that's a win on my end.  The material is very soft and comfortable, but the chain came off while I was trying it on for the first time. Easily fixed if you put the chain on the safety pin the shirt includes, unless you rather take it off which you could also do.  Came with a weird smell, I'll have to wash it and see if it stays put afterwards. If it does then I'll give it 5 stars.",

The fit is just as she wanted and at first glance the quality appeared to be up to par.  After one washing of following the garments tag instructions the black short sleeved t-shirt portion is faded and converse in white lint. Using a lint roller made  little impact and this is not what I expect from brand new clothing worn less than half a day and washed once. Can’t decide if it’s worth keeping or trying to exchange. Daughter doesn’t want to give up the shirt.,4

I read one review that it had “thicker material”? Literally fooling you because I bought it and the material was super thin and stretchy. When I wore it, it felt like those stretchy sport shirts 😭 The design of the shirt looked blurry printed… I don’t think $20 is worth it for this shirt. I was really looking forward for this shirt, this shirt is terrible quality. (Guys you can find a cheaper one in aliexpress! I’m sure it’s better quality than this one)",12
