The pictures make it look like it’s cut differently than a normal tee, but it’s not. The printing does feel nice and appears to be good quality so there is that. It also runs small. It’s closer to a large on the smaller side, so you don’t even get that good baggy feel. There is a possibility that the sizing chart explained all of this but unfortunately, I did not have a CM measuring tape. This could have all been avoided with actual pictures of the shirt and not folded/altered pictures. The sad thing is I still would have probably purchased the shirt just for the cut print.",

Not horrible because I just wear it backwards at that point. The print on the shirt as well feels a lot like a sticker? Like at some point with enough wear and tear the print will crack or peel off?
