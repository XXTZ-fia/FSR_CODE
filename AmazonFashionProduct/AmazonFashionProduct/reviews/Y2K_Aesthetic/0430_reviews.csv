I normally don’t like sweaters but this one is breathable enough that I don’t overheat. I’ve worn this 3 times now and there is a small issue that the yarn has gotten caught on things and now there is a few random strands of yarn. Otherwise I love it.,

S. H.,Fun flame design that throws back to the early 2000s,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BLLEYO6J4FME/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CB6GRFH3,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 5, 2023",Size: SmallColor: 1-green,,"This green flame sweater is made from 100% Acrylic yarn and it is so soft. It isn’t rough or scratchy at all. I found it extremely comfortable to wear all day.  It probably isn’t the warmest sweater. I live in California and the fact that I could be comfortable wearing this when the temperature is in the 60s indicates that it’s great as a fashion piece, but if you’re in a Northern state or somewhere that gets “real” winters, this will not be enough unless it’s one of many layers.  Another indicator that it’s on the thin side is that you can very clearly see the second layer of yarn from the underside of the fabric. For example, white yarns can be seen in the ribbing of the black areas, and black can be seen poking through the green areas. This has the effect of subduing the colors of the sweater - the colors aren’t nearly as vibrant as you see in the stock photos, and from a distance the black looks like more of a dark grey because of all the lighter color behind the black yarn.  I also found that the sleeves seemed a little short compared to the torso. I had planned for an oversized look, but the sleeves fit more like a small woman’s sweater so the fit ends up looking a little weird because the main body is still sized to a man.",4

So far no issues, but I will say the knit is kind of ""big"" or I don't know how to say it - maybe ""loose"" is a better term.
