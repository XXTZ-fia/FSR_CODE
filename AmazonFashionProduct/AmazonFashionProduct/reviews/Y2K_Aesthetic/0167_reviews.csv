It is comfortable and cute. I have double D’s and they are not exactly contained in the top of this shirt lol. If you don’t mind that look (like me) you can make it work but be warned if you have larger breasts this shirt won’t be the most modest.,

The cut is lower than I was expecting. I would either not reccomend for someone with a larger chest or suggest sizing up because the front stiching on mine broke within the first few hours of ever wearing it. It is still wearable, just the little stich holding the twisted fabric together came undone. Also, if you tend to sweat a lot and do not like having sweat stains i do not reccomend this. I let a friend borrow it and within an hour there were visible wet spots at her pits (we were indoors and she said it happens often with that material) Overall, not a bad shirt",
