The gems are a little wonky, but expected for something like this.  Giving 4 stars because of the amount of plastic the rings are packaged in. Each ring was individually packaged in a baggie, then put into a larger baggie, then zipped in a black bag. Waste of resources in my opinion, wish they could find a better way to package.",
