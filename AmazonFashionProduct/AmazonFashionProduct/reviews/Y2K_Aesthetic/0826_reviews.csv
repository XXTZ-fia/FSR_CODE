holly watson,Alice in Wonderland anyone?!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KL6GWPQ79CDS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CVTMYMLP,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 19, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Wedding Dress,Verified Purchase,"Oh my god! This dress is so cute! It is comfortable. I recently filmed a music video with my band and bought this dress for that purpose. It allowed me to stay cool during filming. Everyone kept telling me I looked like Alice. The fit was perfect. There are 2 things about the dress I wish I could change. First, it is hand wash only. Second, the zipper on the side bunches up, which you can see in the second photo. Honestly the material is so stretchy that the zipper isn’t really needed. If you are looking for a cute emo dress I would recommend this in a heartbeat.",
