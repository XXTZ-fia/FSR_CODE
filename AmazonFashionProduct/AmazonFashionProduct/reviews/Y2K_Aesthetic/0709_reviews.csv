RealDealReviews,Fun and Stylish Y2K-Inspired Crop Top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3N6HASUS6M1SJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPLYZ669,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 13, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Fish,Verified Purchase,"From my wife:  I absolutely love this Tee! It’s such a fun, stylish addition to my wardrobe. The graphic print on the front is vibrant and eye-catching, giving it a real retro vintage aesthetic that’s on point for the Y2K trend. I’ve gotten so many compliments when I wear it, especially with the cool, nostalgic vibe it gives off.  The fit is perfect. It’s slim and cropped, hugging in all the right places without being too tight. I love that it’s not overly cropped, so I feel comfortable wearing it with high-waisted jeans or skirts. The material is soft and breathable, making it ideal for warmer weather, and I can wear it all day without feeling too hot or uncomfortable.  The quality of the fabric is really good for the price. It’s lightweight, yet durable enough to hold up after a few washes without losing its shape or color. I’ve been careful to wash it in cold water and air dry it to preserve the print, and so far, it’s held up really well.  The design gives off a relaxed, cool vibe while still looking polished enough to wear out with friends or to run errands. It pairs well with just about anything, from casual jeans to cute skirts or even layered under a jacket. The versatility of this top really makes it worth adding to your closet.  Overall, this Y2K Baby Tee is stylish, comfortable, and just the right amount of edgy. It’s a perfect blend of retro and modern, and I’m so happy with how it looks and feels. Highly recommend it if you’re looking for something fun and fashionable!",

The image is like printed in rather than actually into the fabric and it’s already starting to peel. But while it’s on there it’s cute and true to size! It’ll still be a cute baby tee when there’s no image,4

Lexi,"Fine shirt, obviously cheap",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ALHLZEP3YYHC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPLYZ669,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 21, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Fish,Verified Purchase,"The shirt is cute, but it's clear that the design is iron-on so I'm worried it will come off in the wash. The shirt itself doesn't seem very well made (there are loose strings) and it also runs very small.. I usually wear a medium but ordered a large, and I definitely could've ordered an xl and would probably be happier with it. Overall, for the cost its pretty cute, I'm not going to return it but also wouldn't order any other shirts again",

This shirt is so small and cropped that it’s hard to wear out, and I’m short (5’1”). That being said, the graphic is super cute and is printed clearly (unlike other dupes of this style). If you’re going for tight and cropped I’d recommend it though! It’s really cute if you can get the right fit.  I’d say it’s really more like 4.5 stars.",

It is so adorable. I wore It out to dinner with my friends with jeans and a blazer and received so many compliments. It is super soft and the cut of the baby tee is super flattering. I love that I can either dress It up with a skirt or jacket or even dress It down with sweats or jeans. I am so pleased with this t-shirt!!!!,
