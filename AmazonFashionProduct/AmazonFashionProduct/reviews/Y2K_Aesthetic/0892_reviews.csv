She loves it. She wears it pretty regularly. Maybe every other day. If not every day. It does not seem to be tarnishing in any way. I’m not sure what kind of durability you’re expecting from this kind of jewelry, but I will say it’s about as sturdy as a piece you would get from Claire’s. So I think that’s pretty good.My daughter has sensitive skin, and she has not broken out from this. This is a pretty set. I can’t believe Y2K has come back lol",

I don't think you *shouldn't* get it, this is a cute set, but you'll need to be careful about these bracelets falling off while washing hands (happened to me multiple times), and about leaving them in your pockets by accident. For me, a bit of a flop, but not an irredeemable one.",

I love that I can wear the necklace alone or together with the matching bracelets. Although it's a chunkier set, it's not too flashy.  I have worn the necklace and bracelets several times, and they have not changed color or flaked.  Overall, I would highly recommend this jewelry set.",5
