re-becca mae,I want one in every color!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D0UHD0TYBHSZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSSRH5ZL,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Color: White Bag,Verified Purchase,"This ita bag is absolutely perfect! It comes with two pouches on the side with clear windows that can display small plushies or figures, and a windowed detachable accessory where you can put can-badges or images. The front pin window is fairly large and can fit at least six can badges (and probably more if you overlap!) and it comes with an insert, so putting your pins in is super easy! There are also lots of places to attach keychains.  The interior of the bag itself is surprisingly roomy and the zippers all feel smooth and sturdy. Like other reviews mentioned, the ears came bent back, but that can be fixed with a blow drier or some tape.  The light blue color worked perfectly for my Miku bag, and I get so many compliments whenever I wear it out! Overall, I highly recommend this product, and I am seriously considering buying this same bag in another color lol.",

I also wouldn’t recommend you use it as an ita bag.

The weight of the PU material is good, thick, and feels pretty smooth. The inner liner is nice with a bit of a shiny tan/taupe zig-zag pattern to it. All of the edges of the purse are either corded in light blue PU or well stitched. And the kitty face features are embroidered stitch. The strap is adjustable with swivel snaps on the ends. The strap can be used for carrying the purse as a shoulder bag or used on the three back rings to wear it like a backpack. The strap can be adjusted from 29"" to 52"" in length. The purse doesn't have any inner pockets just a single main compartment that is roughly 9"" wide, 8"" tall, and 3"" thick. It has plenty of space but without any organization possibilities. The side pockets are windowed and are 3"" wide, 4"" tall, and 1"" thick. Good for smaller items and also for displaying extras. The main display window pocket is 9""wide like the main body, 5"" tall, and 1"" thick. There is plenty of room to display items and trinkets. Overall it's a nice purse for what it is. It is definitely a good show piece for anyone who is into the kawaii design and also wants to show off some personal flair. I got this purse for my wife and she absolutely loves it. We tested it out in the backpack configuration and it set right at the center of her back perfectly with the strap extend out at 52"" (for reference she is 5'-8"" 135lb). I had a lot of fun setting up the display window on this purse for her and she was very happy when she saw it for the first time. 5 stars.",8

The bag itself met my expectations upon arrival: it's a modestly sized crossbody, with good interior space to hold plenty of items. However, it smelled REALLY strong right out of the box, and I had to air it out for a few weeks before use. Also the cat ears were folded down, and they still haven't straightened out. The display pockets are the main selling point, and they are quite spacious. The main one in the front can fit fairly large items including coasters, and of course smaller ones like keychains, rubber straps, can badges/pins, etc. Small plushes could probably also fit inside, though I haven't tried. The side pockets can also fit keychains and even small trading figures, but probably too small for a nendoroid. There are also a few rings on the front of the bag to hang additional decorations. As other reviewers have mentioned, the main front pocket does not come with its own insert, and this was not specified in the listing. You will have to get/cut your own for this bag. Ultimately the display pockets do work, and were fun to arrange. The inside of the bag is quite spacious, but I wish it came with some interior zipper pockets. All considered it's a cute itabag and, with a few tweaks, would be perfect.",4

Additionally, there were areas inside of the bag where the stitching was very loose and poor. It will come apart soon if I use it so I will have to repair it myself and purchase a strap and insert separately. I cannot recommend you get this bag due to these issues. :( Such a shame.",2

The one we got seems to have solid stitching and no real problems. The only disappointment, which I think is notable with an ITA pin bag, is that there is no pin insert. Yes, you can still push a button/badge pin through the fabric and have it display, but if you're using any enamel pins then it gets a lot trickier to use easily and risk the back coming off in the main section of the bag.

It's purse-sized and won't hold a school notebook, but it will hold a pencil case, phone, small sketch pad or journal, and other small items in the main/middle pocket. This pocket is lined (in the gray accent color) and it has no inner separations. The front pocket is transparent, as shown, and I was happy to see that the little side pockets are too. The zippers work fine and the star-shaped pulls are a nice touch. The outside of the purse has 5 attachments, or 7 if you use the rings that have the straps attached. The detachable strap is adjustable and somewhat padded so that it's comfy even though it's a bit thin. You can shift it to crossbody style too. The ears were folded down on receiving it, but with periodic straightening throughout the day they straightened up.",

It's unusual to see them on the outside instead of inside the pocket.  It lacks the accessories shown and I couldn't find anywhere to buy the matching ID badge pocket. The wings are so poorly cut I don't think you can even tell what they're meant to be, not quite matching the picture on the listing. The wings and many loose threads are what knocks this down to a four for me. If it had been a little cheaper, maybe I could have overlooked it.

Weither it comes with it or not its a disappointment since it didn't say it didn't come with it so the description needs to be clear. It as well doesn't come with the pin inserts so you would have to get those seriously as well. For the size and price I think to me is a tad bit expensive especially for key commoners to be missing for an Ita bag. The bag itself is cute don't me wrong but if I'm having to do more work I'd rather pass on it.  One of the zippers gives me a hard time trying to close while the other one gives me a hard time to open. When it jams then the zipper opens when it should be sealed in the middle.

It has 3 zippered pouches with clear fronts on the outside. Two small ones on the sides and one large one in front… lots of space to display merch. The main front pouch has two loops yo can hook keychains to. I would have liked to have seen one on the inside of the large pouch as well for clipping keychains and charms to, keeping them safe while still being displayed. There are no inserts to hold your pins, so you will need to provide your own. There are no pockets in the inside, but it is very roomy.  It comes with a nice long crossbody strap. The back has 3 loops, presumably for backpack straps (not included) if you happen to have some.  The outside material is very soft faux leather. I would love to see this same design as a black cat.  Been trying to get the ears to stand up. They were folded down in the packaging and are being stubborn about standing upright now.  The pictures are a little misleading. It does not come with the matching keychain or the backpack straps shown (and I’m not sure where you can get them).

cdragon,Missing a couple key components,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3C7GRK3YWMF0D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSSRH5ZL,"3.0 "," the United States "," April 22, 2024",Color: White Bag,,"Unfortunately this so-called ita bag is missing one of the most important parts... the pin insert! The clear pouch to display your pins is useless without the removable piece to attach your pins to. I'm certainly not about to pierce through the main bag lining (and the clear pocket is too deep for that to look good, anyway) so I guess I'm just going to try to make my own with felt and cardboard or something. It was very disappointing since I've wanted a proper ita bag for a long time to show off my pins without risk of losing them, but out of the package, I can't use this.  The matching keychains shown are also not included, which would be more understandable if they weren't in absolutely every photo including the measurements. The bag has ample room for attachments but you'll have to provide your own. My photo shows what you actually get, just the basic bag with star zipper pulls and a shoulder strap. I'm not thrilled at being misled by the product photos although the bag itself (mostly) lives up to the cuteness.  Quality-wise, I had to trim fourteen loose threads as nearly every seam was a mess. The sewing could definitely be improved. Also, the rings attaching the zippers all needed to be closed with a pair of pliers: they were open enough that the zipper pulls could easily have fallen off with use.  So I guess if you're up for a little DIY work, this bag is fine; it certainly is a cute design, and the material is buttery soft. But I think you're probably better off finding one better made that actually has a pin insert and decent quality control.",

Kawaii!!!! She declared.The bag is perfect for anyone who likes the cute bag thing.  It has little ears, a clear plastic ""tummy"", it is soft and it is totally cute.  I am a cat lover, and could see myself taking this for a stroll at a variety of rescue events.It comes with a lovely strap.  A bit thin, but I like it.  The fabric is very soft and the seams are well made.  This is not a bag for loads of stuff, but it is perfect for daily things like wallet, etc.  It makes a cute addition to whatever your handbag goals are.Love it.",
Myca Noelle,super cute!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16FH82G1CST89/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSSRH5ZL,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 2, 2024",Color: White Bag,Verified Purchase,"this is now my everyday bag (i take it to work) i like it because it’s more spacious than my other bags(i need to carry my kindle always) so it can fit without being too snugged and having to take everything out. this bag does not come with the little white keychain(that was one of the reason that this bag caught my eye but i did message the seller and they explained it was just for the pictures) also the merch area is more smaller than i was expecting. so i decided to keep my bag anyways because it super cute!! (i carry 2 wallets 1 big one and 1 smaller one(the kine that can open and fold), a coin purse(the monster high mystery one it’s the skull with some change in it) sun glasses, lipglosses, chapstick, airpods,  a pouch with 2 tiny anime figures plus another tiny figure (mystery bag kine) with me i also have a pen and my kindle ofc (it’s a kindle fire 7 so i think it’s heavier than a regular kindle) i also carry around a book (rn it’s madness and civilization by Michael Foucault) and sometimes my planner when i need it it’s about the size of the kindle but lighter. my only “complaint” about the bag is that the strap itself is kind of thin (i’m worried if i put too much it might break) i’m also kind of worried that the bag will peel more easier as the material is more like the soft fake leather kine if that makes sense. if anything does happen i will update how long it last for or what happens.",5

It’s pretty wide space but, it isn’t long so you can’t fit tall books inside! Still good though",

(Amazon makes this so easy and affordable as opposed to shipping items ourselves to another country.) She said it was ""awesome""-- except that (sorry to say) it came with a roach in it!  Otherwise, she would have rated it a 5-star.  Not only is it cute but is good quality and has various pockets inside and out which is a feature she especially likes.",
