They gave me the refund for the Small but are refusing to give me the refund for the Medium.  Today, I tried for the 3rd time to get my refund.  We’re talking about $41.13.  I returned the item on December 1st.  They are giving me some song and dance that I used a coupon for the purchase —- which I didn’t.  Amazon made a mistake and I’m paying for it.  And on top of that, I couldn’t have been treated more rudely or condescendingly by their customer service reps.  And 2 days before Christmas.  Just shocking.  Needless to say, I will have to pursue my refund with my credit card company.  I am beyond astonished.  Amazon is going downhill.  I don’t know how anyone can trust them.",
