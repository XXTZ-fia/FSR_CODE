The color of the sweater received (Left image) is more of a Pepto Bimal pink, not the soft powder pink in the ad (Right image).  The fabric has more of a polyester feel than cotton, although the blend is listed as 55% Cotton, 25% Model, 25% Polyester.  The fit is fitted so I recommend to size up if between sizes.  The quality is fine and I would say for the price of under $25, it is worth it, however the misrepresented color is a deal breaker for me and so  I'm returning it.",

This is a thinner sweater that is nice and soft with a V-neck that isn't too low. It has beautiful color choices. When it arrived for Christmas wrapping I realized I needed one for myself. I mistakenly ordered a size smaller than I usually wear because I wanted a particular color and it only came in the smaller size. When I received it, the size fit me great! I am usually a size medium, I accidentally ordered the small, but it is stretchy enough, it actually fits very well. For reference, my bust is a 36DD, and I have long arms being 5'10"" tall. The small has nice long sleeves, and the V-neck isn't too low. It does fit closer to my skin than my daughters medium which I tried on after she suggested it, So if you are ordering, order your regular size unless you like your thinner sweaters to be closer fitting. Since it is stretchy, you could size down. Or, just order one in each of the different sizes and see what you think. Amazon makes this sweater very affordable. I don't know yet about how this sweater washes, but I use mesh laundry bags and will probably wash it in cold on delicate inside out in that little bag. I definitely will hang it to dry.",
