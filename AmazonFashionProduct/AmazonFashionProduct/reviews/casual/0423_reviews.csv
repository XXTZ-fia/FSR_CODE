It's lightweight, the colors are pretty, and it fits true to size.  The white stripe is slightly see-thru, but I just wear a light bra under it and it's fine. Soft and stretchy, I don't think it'll shrink, especially since I don't put it in the dryer. I hang dry and it keeps it very nice and didn't shrink at all.",

I bought it because I'd purchased on about a year ago but noticed the fabric is much thinner (more like a thinner T-shirt than a durable hoodie). I'll be keeping it but it will be something I will have to wear a sweater over rather than being a bit warmer for late fall or early spring weather. Also, you'll have to plan on ironing it to remove the shrink-wrap wrinkles. They didn't fall out in the washing machine or the drier. I'm interested to see how wash and wear it will be in the end. I would buy it if you find it at a good sale price, but wouldn't pay full price for it. Also, I got the same size as my other shirt but it doesn't have that long hoodie feel, and the sleeves are just long enough.",9

It's perfect everywhere, except the length. It does NOT cover your rear like the model pictures show. Not sure if they've started making them shorter since they took the photos or what. I am ~200 lbs, 5'-6, 36C, and size large fits fairly fitted, not too snug, flattering, looks like the right size, but it is too short, hits just below the waist, the jeans zipper area is not covered, and definitely does not go down to the crotch or cover any part of the rear. If I sized up to XL, it'd be a bit roomier up top but according to the measurements shown would only be slightly longer and would still not hit where the photos show it hits on the models. If you look close at some of the real life photos, you can see it does ride higher on them too, but others not, so I'm wondering if they've started making these shorter than at first. Overall I like it, but really wish it were longer! It would be much more versatile, if longer and more coverage. Edit: I've checked the measurements and it is not as advertised. The length of the large is supposed to be 27.16 inches and mine is only 25. I smoothed and stretched it as well and that still only gets me a measurement of 25 inches, so it is over 2 inches shorter than the size chart says it will be. Maybe some people received accurately sized ones but it looks like they've changed them and are now making them shorter. I've noticed it is bothersome as I wear it, I'm constantly tugging at it trying to make it longer.",30
