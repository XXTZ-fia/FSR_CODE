Returned and bought the XL and ran it through the wash and dried it to get it to shrink, worked perfectly. They will shrink if you use heat in the dryer. I wash on gentle now and low heat in the dryer as the fit is good. It's tough to find clothes that fit me off the rack, let alone from amazon. Short bodybuilder build (48 inchish chest, 19 inch arms). I paired these with Lion Nardo shorts from amazon as well. Great combo, you will not find more comfortable clothes that look nice and breath. I am in the south and they are comfortable. I bought every color and most of the colors in the short sleeve version. I wish they had more colors, I would buy them all. I wear them instead of t-shirts now. Sleeves are a little long even after shrinking, I roll them so I don't care but be aware if you plan on wearing with the sleeves down. I've washed them several times and they've held up, hopefully they will continue to do so. Wash them gentle (after you shrink if needed, THEY WILL SHRINK), dry on low/medium heat and hang them up quick, they will wrinkle - it's linen (or part linen). If you are thinking about it, pull the trigger on these. The more you wash them, the more comfortable they become, it has honestly blown my mind how much I love these.",

It's flattering to wear and looks good both with the sleeves buttoned and with the sleeves unbuttoned and rolled up.  The only real drawbacks are 1) it wrinkles easily (the nature of linen) and 2) getting the right size can be tough because it's not standard American sizing.  Use the size chart to make sure you get the right size, especially since there's no stretch to the material.  Might be tight in the upper arms if you have above average muscles/shoulders.Shirts are a blend of linen and cotton, so not pure linen.  Still has the linen look, and the cotton makes wrinkling a tiny bit harder.  I ordered a few colors.  They match what's shown on the screen, so no surprises there.  I find these shirts good for hot weather and they're meant to be worn without an undershirt so as to keep you cool in hot weather. Recommended.",6
