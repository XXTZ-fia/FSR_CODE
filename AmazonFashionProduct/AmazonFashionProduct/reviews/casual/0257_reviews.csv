Antonette,Great casual blouse,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3Q88MFMVGHYYJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMK6966,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Color: NavySize: Small,,"Wonderful blouse to wear with jeans, shorts, or casual business.  My favorite type of blouse…doesn’t shrink or wrinkle.  However, blouse does seem to run a tad big. I am a solid medium, and had to get a small, which fits me great.",
Heather Manheim,Cute shirt but not flattering on me,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L8JRU0K3E7GU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMK6966,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Color: BlackSize: X-Large,,"I like this shirt, not love it. It's cute with lace sleeves that dress it up a little more. I wish I had gone a size larger so the material would have laid straighter. It's a comfortable shirt and the material is soft. I just didn't think it was super flattering on me.",
Mike,It's a nice shirt but runs a bit small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHK5N5R9QDG7S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMK6966,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: BlackSize: X-Large,,The shirt is nice but see through. Runs small. I got an XL and it felt like a large. The cloth feels cheap.,
Jessica Edwards,"Cute, I should have sized up",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13TYEXD2YN0ZD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMK6966,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: Wine RedSize: X-Large,,"This shirt is cute. It’s not a bold color but almost a washed color, which I definitely like. The sleeves are also super cute and not itchy.  I didn’t love the stripes down the front (same color) but I might have if I had sized up. That’s my fault, not theirs. I usually wear between a XL and a XXL. A XXl would’ve looked nicer.  I did also enjoy the length. I feel like shirts are so short now, this one is not. Perfect length.",
Reina,Cute and comfy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF5Z62ZSTN4UT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMK6966,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Medium,,"I got my hands on this top recently and I've been wearing it quite a bit. I was pleased to find that it fits true to size, which is always a relief, not to mention not remotely guaranteed when ordering clothes on here any more. The style is undeniably cute, and I've received a lot compliments on it. The material is comfortable enough for everyday wear, and has a nice little bit of stretch to it. Overall, it's a really good top that fits well with my more recent style choices.",
CH,Very Pretty,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AZT2AFG0MBSY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMK6966,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: BlackSize: X-Large,,"I ordered this top because it had the lacy sleeves and looked so dressy. It did not disappoint. I ordered the black because I was looking for something a little classy that I could wear for casual or dressy but I think any of the colors would work.  The fit is true, I ordered a XL and it fit perfectly and is very comfortable.",
Jimmy Porto,Absolutely love this top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L7AP2EPO96G1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMK6966,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: NavySize: Medium,,"This is an all around perfect top, can be worn for all occasions and it it a true size. if you take a small order a small, if you take a medium, order a medium …etc. I would 100% recommend this purchase.",
grumpymonkey,A classy touch to a comfortable T,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QZYZSBKXRCRR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMK6966,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: KhakiSize: Large,,This classy design T shirt is easy to wear with causal office attire or for night out at better restaurants. I liked it with skirt too. The details on the front were perfect with a A line skirt.,
Angus66,Lays nice,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1F5WH6D06CRG3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMK6966,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: BlackSize: X-Large,,"A bit roomy, which I like! Soft material. Piping on front is a nice touch. Washed beautifully too.",
Perpetual Student,A casual T with a little something extra,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BCBRJHKLZKAI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMK6966,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Color: NavySize: Medium,,"I’m not really into shirts with logos or words, but I also don’t really like completely PLAIN t shirts, so I’m left to find t shirts that have a little something extra, a little interesting detail without going bananas.  A “lace” detail can go badly / weirdly trashy pretty quickly, but I thought this was really cute.  The raglan sleeve inset to the sleeve makes it sporty so it keeps it in the casual lane, the vertical raised seams on the bodice are interesting, and overall it’s a great little top for the upcoming spring/summer.  I like the denim/heathered blue color and I’m looking forward to temps warming up so I can pair this with jeans or shorts.",2
TKWM,"Soft, true to size",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RI4Y9GTL8JH4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMK6966,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Color: NavySize: Large,,"The material was softer than I expected, as well as being pretty breathable. I ordered a large, and it seems true to size. The sleeves fit a little shorter than I thought, but the overall fit is relaxed enough to be roomy and comfortable. It's a versatile top that can be dressed up or down. There is a brand/size tag on the back of the collar, and a care/materials tag inside on the torso.",
vicwier,Comfort with Style,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WUG5M2CCYDBX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMK6966,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Color: NavySize: Large,,"I love wearing T-shirts for the comfort, but often times I feel like a slob for wearing them.  This t-shirt is a game changer.  It is really pretty and has some detail that make it look more feminine than most, like the fabric used for the sleeves and the sewn detail down the front.  I'm 5'3"" 195 lbs and the large fits perfectly. It's also nice and long.  This one is a winner.",3
