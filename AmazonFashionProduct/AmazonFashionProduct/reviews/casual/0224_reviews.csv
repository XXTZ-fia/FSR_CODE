Very comfortable dress and I was so happy with the quality. Made me feel beautiful 😊,

The tie in the front can be undone and be wrapped inside the dress and under your arms if you are wanting a little more formal of a look. The material is very nice and it has no issues being washed on a normal cycle from the couple of times I've worn and washed it. It hugs around your waist and then flows from there. I personally got my normal size (large) and it has fit really well but I don't have to use the zipper on the side so I potentially could have sized down.,
