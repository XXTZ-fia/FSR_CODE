Not sure how there is a delay when the shoe is available, so if you’re not 100% confident in your size, it might not be worth the order if you end up unlucky like me.",

These shoes, like the last pair I ordered, taper fast to a pointy toe box. That's why I had to go up in size, I am glad I did.

The thing I like about New Balance is the size is correct and consistent on ALL of their shoes. You can always depend on your shoe size to fit on all their shoes.  These are cross train/walking shoes and they are perfect. I have three other pairs but i prefer these over the others because the suede is more flexible and breaths.,

I find that they offer mediocre lateral stability and support and the shoelace hole/eyelet design is flawed. 2 pairs of eyelets in the middle of the eyelet stack are made of cloth. So rather than the lace going through leather (like usual) on these two pairs of eyelets they go through a non leather material. This material stretches' faster and more then the leather eyelets and creates an imbalance in the support  to your foot. Too much pressure is provided to one spot of the foot rather then spread out evenly across the entire shoe...For the price nice pair of casual walkers, but for more demanding activities I'd look at a more expensive ND trainer.",2
