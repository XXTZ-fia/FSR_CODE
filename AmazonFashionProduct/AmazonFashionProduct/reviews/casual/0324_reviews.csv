Monkey,Need a tank top underneath,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S0DDIW2TPL80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHGQGQ9Z,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 28, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Bright Green,Verified Purchase,It looked like there was an under layer but there was not so if you don’t want you or your underclothes to be obvious you will need to wear something underneath. That is not a huge issue but the color is gorgeous and I feel like even the flesh colored tank detracts a little. Fit is good and true to size.,

It is made of a lightweight stretchy fabric polyester/elastane and very comfortable.  The fabric texture is eyelet-like.  Some people might like a camisole underneath.  The fit is true.  It's not really loose like some tops are described.  Very nice. Not boxy. Very versatile. Can be casual or dressy.  Looks good either way.  Machine Washable.  Tumble Dry on Low.,

The style is really cute and the sleeves aren't too poofy. The bottom isn't too tight on my belly, which is great to not accentuate that part of my body. Lol",

Polyester Fabric with Lapped ""V"" Neckline .... Well sewn, durable seams, overlock stitching ... Machine wash, Air dry on hanger very quickly/fast  Fabric has a knit/crochet/lacey LOOK ... Femine, delicate ... Pull over head, easy ... Fit is roomy across tummy, true-to-size in shoulders .... Sleeves come down a bit further, a good feature to me ... Comfortable fit, does NOT cling ... Length is slightly longer for a fuller figure, but not overly hanging ... Flatters nicely  ""V"" is a tad low, so I placed a decorative pin about an inch from low area  You CAN see thru the eyelets a bit if looking hard, but an additional shirt/under garment is not necessary for modesty ... Not sheer, a good weight of fabric ... I got several styles and colors, in my usual size ... Dress up with a skirt, or dress down with slacks/jeans ... Easy care fabric, even though label says 'dry clean', it's not necessary  .",

The Virgin Green,Better quality than expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33IMG70A3XOH5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHGQGQ9Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 31, 2024",Size: SmallColor: White,,"The fabric is comfortable and breathable. I am 160 lbs. and 5’4”, with a 36B bust. I ordered a size small and it fits really well - but I was not looking for a super-loose fit. It’s quite flattering on me.  You’ll definitely need to wear a camisole or undershirt beneath it. The fabric is see-through, but given the pattern and weight, what did you expect?  I find it’s best to wash the shirt and then hang ir up to dry. It’s not strictly necessary, but it will prevent wrinkling and misshaping.",
JUK,"Great shirt, soft, does not cling to trouble areas",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HFNQFF0FH6UB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHGQGQ9Z,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Parchment,,"At this stage in my life It’s hard to find shirts that I feel look great on me. This blouse looks good on me. It’s a soft material but does not cling to trouble areas. If you’re looking for want it tighter fitting I would suggest sizing down. It’s definitely not a fitted top. It has plenty of room in the stomach area. Mine was just a little bit loose, looks great partially or fully tucked in. Looks great with leggings as well as with a skirt. Very versatile item. The eyelet lace pattern is flattering but does cause the shirt to be slightly see through. I’m my opinion an undershirt is not a necessity but you could definitely wear one and I’m sure it would look great. It’s definitely not days dry clean on the tag but I have machine washed this with no problem. Just make sure to hang dry it.",

The material makes it feel a bit dressier than your typical t-shirt. I like the sleeves and the fact that the material has a bit of stretch so it’s comfortable to wear. Just keep in mind you need to wear an undershirt or you can see through the eyelets.,
Nikki S-G.,Very cute but very see through!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RE5682L1PKVCK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHGQGQ9Z,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 14, 2024",Size: MediumColor: White,,"This blouse is very cute and on trend for 2025 with the high collar and puff sleeves.

Jen X.,Nice and roomy and with Plenty of Stretch,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7TX3GUS1KVE7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHGQGQ9Z,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 25, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Light Pink,,"No matter what shape you come in, every woman claims to have a troubled area. For me, it’s having a short torso. If I am not careful, loose-fitting clothes hang on me like burlap on a scarecrow. In my case, it’s more scary than cute. This blouse with its eyelet detail appeared ultra feminine and perfect for spring. I ordered a light color so that the details of the pattern show up better. But I struck out with this one. It hangs funny on my thin frame, instead of slightly loose, it is completely boxy on me, and the balloon sleeves make me look like I have stick figure arms. I think if it were more tailored and the material made from cotton, the fit might be different. Usually I like a little stretch in the fabric but for athletic wear, not for clothes meant for going out. But if your preference is for roomy tops with plenty of stretch, this blouse might work for you.",2
Jamie,Order your regular size...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32YEGK45H8PCS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHGQGQ9Z,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 29, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"I am normally an L and ordered an L, and this fit perfectly. I think that while this top is such a cute style, it's a bit uncomfortable. But let me tell you why. This shirt is 95% polyester, and despite the fact that it's an eyelet style it still got really hot even on a 70 degree day. That's really unfortunate for me because I live in a hot place, so that means I probably won't get much use out of this. I guess if you live in a cooler climate, then totally go for it because it's really cute.",2

I do not like puffy sleeves as a general rule but this looked like it might not be too bad and it really is only a ""mild"" poof and the overall look is very feminine.  I normally get a 2X or XXL and this XXL fits me perfectly! Both my husband and my daughter immediately complimented how nice the shirt looked and what a beautiful color it is.  I ordered the green in anticipation for wanting too wear holiday and festive colors.  This shirt also came rolled up which is unusual but it was very cool because when I took the shirt out... NO WRINKLES!!  Normally everything comes vacuum packed and fit takes at least a couple washings to get the wrinkles out. This shook out and looked great! I was debating between green and pink and I think I might have to order the pink too!",

I got it in black, so I wear a black bra underneath and the mattress pattern cut-outs in the other areas are not too revealing as to need anything else underneath.  The sleeves are long enough to be nearly half-length to just above the elbows.  This is a beautiful shirt which is way upscale from a tee shirt but still casual for jeans and everyday wear.  I love it!",

I sprayed some wrinkle spray on it before wearing it, it seemed to help quite a bit plus putting it on helped straighten it out. The color is beautiful and the material is thin and stretchy, which is perfect for me because I suffer with hot flashes. There are decorative holes in the shirt but it is not at all see-through. I also love the fact that the sleeves have elastic in them rather than tightly stitched, that makes it much better for all different arm sizes This shirt is definitely a keeper and I will definitely wear this a lot.

I ordered a size large because the size chart showed for my bust size to size up to a large. Normally I wear a size medium. I should’ve ordered my regular size. I think this runs true to size. What I did not like about this top is that the collar and the cuffs and the V part of the neck line are all really stiff with some type of interfacing that makes it not lay flat. It kind of sticks out. The holes are kind of small so it’s not show through on the top. I feel comfortable wearing it without needing a lining or undershirt.,2
