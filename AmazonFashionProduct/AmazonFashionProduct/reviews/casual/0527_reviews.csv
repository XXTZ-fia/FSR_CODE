I will get this in other colors.",

It fits true to size. I got a medium and I'm 5'7 - 155lbs with DDs. It's a loose fitting shirt which I like a lot. The red part of the sleeves is a little bit more fitted which gives it a more stylish look.,

It's not very flattering, looks boxy and there's parts of it where I feel like the symmetry in the arms is off. The color combo seemed fun from the product descriptions but when wearing I feel like a big candy-cane. I'm not a fan of the shirt fit or style.",

It is more of a fitted shirt then a loose and I ordered larger for an oversized fit and it was still snug. The arm holes are a little tight making the sleeves feel tighter then preferred.

The colors are vivid and the white is bright.  I will wear this for sure on the fourth of July.  It fits me well, like a t-shirt should, loose but not baggy.  It is 95% cotton, but it feels soft and pliable, not like traditional cotton. Maybe it's the 5% elastine.  It is a well made product.  It checks all the boxes for me as far as t-shirts go.",2

Wedgewood Mom,Runs small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K3M998OCH6WS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHQLNYBQ,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Rosy Red,,This shirt is very cute! My daughter immediately commented that I looked like a jumbo strawberry! LOL  The only con I have for the shirt is that it runs a little small.  I would definitely suggest you order up a size if you want to have the loose fit shown in the picture. I ordered my normal size and it fits like a normal t-shirt but not really at all loose so I took off 1 star for the bad sizing.,2

This little shirt is really a basic simple t-shirt.  But the cuffed sleeve and the colorful stripes bring it a little personality.  The material is a little stiffer, thicker than a regular cotton t-shirt which helps elevate this a little more.  I do think I should have ordered a size up due to my chest being a little on the larger size and if I had read the sizing chart I would've noticed this.  This shirt does fit and it fits comfortably, just not as loose as pictured which is the look I wanted.",2

Feels vintage. The stripe configuration and sleeves are very flattering. My only criticism is that the color is not exactly as pictured. The background color on the black and white is really more cream than white, which gives the entire shirt a yellow cast. I would still recommend.",

I did think it was going to be blue and black, but it is blue and brown. Not an issue, but just in case you thought the same…  I ordered a medium and feel like I could have easily gone with a small. I’m 5’4” and 135 and don’t like my clothes to fit tight, but even a small would not have been tight.  The sleeves are ruched just a little and it gives it a slightly feminine touch. Will be a cute shirt in a wear year-round.",4
Larry Mekus,Nice Women's Striped Color Block Tee,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R119LW1L3TPOOU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHQLNYBQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Pink White,,"This striped color block tee is exactly what I needed for an easy, casual summer look. The loose, relaxed fit makes it incredibly comfortable to wear, especially on warm days. I love the color block design—it’s fun and adds a bit of personality without being too bold, making it easy to pair with anything from jeans to shorts or even a cute skirt.  The crewneck and short sleeves give it a classic t-shirt feel, but the color combination makes it feel more stylish and put-together. The fabric is soft and breathable, perfect for staying cool while still looking chic. It’s the kind of top that I can throw on and feel good in, whether I’m running errands or meeting friends for a casual outing.  For anyone looking for a comfy, versatile tee with a pop of style, this color block top is a fantastic choice. It’s a simple yet stylish piece that works well in any casual wardrobe, and it’s sure to be a go-to favorite!",
