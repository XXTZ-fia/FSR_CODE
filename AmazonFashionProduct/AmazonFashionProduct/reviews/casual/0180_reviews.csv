The sheer mesh feels a bit thin and I ran into a small fit issue. The fabric coverage in the front was lower than I expected, so it didn't cover me quite as much as I would've liked. I think this is because of my particular body type though. I did really like how soft the inner fabric feels against the skin - it's super comfortable and the ruching on the sides is really flattering. Also, the turtleneck is comfortable and doesn't feel too tight around the neck. I got my usual size Medium, and it actually feels like a better fit than what the sizing chart suggested (which was a Large). Overall, while I had a few minor issues, it's still a really pretty top that you can dress up with jeans.",3
