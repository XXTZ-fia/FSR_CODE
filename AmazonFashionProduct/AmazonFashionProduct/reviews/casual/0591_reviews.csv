The second pair was good too. It was interesting that wrangler put a cellphone pocket on both sides. The alignment was a little off but I adjusted all fine. Third pair was too small for the waist and is now super thin fabric. I was just like ok, maybe I gained weight and my other pants have stretched so I ordered one size up and they are super baggy, whatever. It works with a belt but I then realized that the cellphone pocket is only on the left side now and I am unfortunately right handed. It was good while it lasted.",

Homer3D,"Runs Big, Side Pockets Too Low",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RUB2XJP6F89V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08M7CML9L,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Size: 33W x 30LColor: Olive Drab,Verified Purchase,"I ordered a size 33w. Same size as my other pants. Checked the label and confirmed that it the size I received. Tried it on and it was very loose, like I could easily take it in an inch. Maybe I should have purchased 32w but all my other 33w pants fit snug. These pants feel like they will fall off if I get up too fast. Put a belt on and the problem is solved but I do really want to wear a belt all the time?? Not sure.  Other issue are the pockets on the legs. They sit too low where any item I put in those pockets end up resting on my knees. So when I walk it is constantly tapping my knee. I don't see a way to resolve this issue.  So while I can return these pants for a smaller size, that still leaves me with the issue of the side pockets being too low. I thought if I bought shorter pants the side pockets will sit higher but then I would be wearing pants too short. The length is perfect. I think the pockets are just placed wrong. Looking at the product image, it shows the side pocket sitting above the model's knee. However, if you check out the images from people who bought the pants, you can see the side pockets for them is sitting AT the knee just like on me.  I will be returning. Too bad. They are super comfortable, even though they are a little on the thin side.",
