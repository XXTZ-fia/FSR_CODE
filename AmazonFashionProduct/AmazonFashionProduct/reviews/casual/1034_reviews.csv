The material is buttery soft!  They run a bit big.  Normally I wear an XL but had to send back and re-order L.  They are also a bit longer than I wanted, (even the L ) but I still would recommend. The vneck is not quite as “sexy” as I’d hoped, more a standard vneck cup (not too deep) but the way the material feels makes them a keeper.  For whatever reason the tag says do not tumble dry.  I have dried mine several times and it still looks and feels great.",2

I got the 2xl which is my usual size. When I first tried them on right out the package I thought they were a little big but I wanted a looser fit so I decided to keep them. I’m so happy I did they shrink slightly in the wash and fit really nice for the fit I was wanting. If you like super fitted I would order a size or 2 down. The material is so soft! A little thin but not shear and good quality with nice stitching. The length I can’t love enough! I do dislike all these women clothes with super short waist and sleeves. Not this shirt it is long in the sleeves and would fit even a long torso person nicely! The v neck is a deep v but it’s perfect for me. If your a busty women and want to be modest this probably isn’t the top for you. Overall I am very happy with this purchase I got a pack of 3 which came with all my favorite color no odd man out that I didn’t like! Love these shirts!,18
