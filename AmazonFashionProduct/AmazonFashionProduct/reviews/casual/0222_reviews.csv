Nichole,Nice looking top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1J2PJ8C5XQKXN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP1YWCGV,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Grey,,"This is a great looking top, I will definitely be ordering in a few other colors. I got the exact size I wear, it’s a little loose but I like it because I don’t like when things are tight.. It’s made well, light weight and soft. My favorite part is how soft and comfortable it is, I could sleep in it. Looks nice, you can dress it up for work or cute casual with jeans.",
SARAH JONES,Buttery SOFT!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZVBDQFA1TCT3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP1YWCGV,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Grey,,"I love this short sleeve sweater! It's super soft, beautiful grey color (yes there is such a thing), and fits even better. I float between a small and a medium so after reviewing the size chart, I went with a small. I am glad I did. This can be worn anytime of the year. Fall or Spring with a jean jacket or Winter with a cute pair of skinny jeans, grey boots and a jacket. Did I mention how soft this sweater is?!!!",
CalGal57,"Weighty, Stretchy Knit - Runs Large",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3H27ZHY846MIE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP1YWCGV,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",,,"I ordered the grey color, and it is a pretty color and design.  I usually wear a medium or large, so I ordered the large because I don't like tight or clingy tops.  But I should have ordered a medium in this sweater because it definitely runs large (across the chest and under the arms).  Also, it is a weighty, stretchy knit, so I anticipate it will stretch out even more.  I haven't washed it yet, but the instructions say machine wash and tumble dry, so maybe it will shrink a bit?",

Valentine,Very cute. Runs large.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZJVTMW8ZHB98/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP1YWCGV,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"The top has a lot of stretch to it and it runs large. It is very forgiving of my narrower shoulders and hippy silhouette. The length is good for me, I hope it doesn't stretch out to look like a drapery panel. It is 100% viscose and requires special care when laundering. I have not washed it yet. It smells and needs a good soak before it can be worn. 🤞I went back and took off a few stars. After wearing a seatbelt it looked like it got pulled out of the bottom of a laundry basket. I disposed of packaging and stuck with it. Oh well, now I know about viscose!",
Mommytd,Nice!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCVEI9K9LYIH3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP1YWCGV,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",,,"I am liking this sweater type top. It’s labeled as summer use and it is thin enough for summer use however I’m using it now in winter.  I like the gray color and the design of the top and it’s lightweight and soft and comfortable.  It fits as expected, and it’s long and loose enough to help disguise my pooch belly.  I’m 5”4, 154lbs and got a size large.",
Emily,"Great material, too large",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R287A7PZMM2AV5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP1YWCGV,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"This shirt is so soft! It has a really nice weight and drape to it. Unfortunately, it was too large for me though. I ordered my typical size, but it looked awful on me. It is a nice quality shirt, but the fit wasn't good on me.",
Traveling Lassie,Beautiful Sweater.

T&H vZ,Oh so soft....,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IZIYS059BI57/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP1YWCGV,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Khaki,,This top is true to size. Very soft. Very well made. The fabric is high quality. I like the length of the top since it is not too long. It has some weight to it but is very comfortable. I would love to have this in black and green. The price is worth it.,
M. Mattox,Such an elegant Shirt!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UM5TYRFOYI8T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP1YWCGV,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",,,"When I unwrapped the Dokotoo Women's Summer Top, I was blown away by this shirt's soft feel and beautiful knit pattern. I ordered the blue one, and it is just so pretty. I know it is advertised as a summer shirt and thin enough to be worn that way. I will wear it with a long-sleeved bodysuit underneath for cooler days, and it makes for a great casual or formal outfit, depending on if you style it with jeans or slacks. This is one of several pieces from this brand I have ordered, and I like the quality, interesting cuts, and patterns. Great shirt!",
A,Great Quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK1NCLXFWYD88/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP1YWCGV,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Black,,This is exactly what I was looking for. It's a good weight so it will keep me cozy but the loose knit towards the top allows for breathability. It's got great detail in the knit so looks much more expensive than it was. It's easy to wash and seems durable. Really love this sweater!,
S Sargent,Such soft fabric,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMGPGDWM2A1MR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP1YWCGV,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Grey,,"This short-sleeved sweater is so soft and silky. The fabric feels like cashmere, seriously.  I am a size 16/XL and this sweater fits true to size. The sleeve comes to the length between my shoulder and elbow, and the length comes to the bottom of my hip. There is a band on the bottom, so there is the option to wear this pushed up a bit or pulled down flat. The body of the sweater is generous and not tight at all, but the sleeves and sleeve hole fit perfectly so it is meant to be a loose look.  The design is classic and pretty. The gray is a light to medium gray and neutral enough to go with most colors. It has a more intricate weave on the top 1/3 of the sweater and extends onto the sleeve.  This look would pair well with jeans, dress pants, or a skirt.",
DisseminateJoy,Love the look and soft fabric,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4ZTMWK89HQ2X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP1YWCGV,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Grey,,"This is a great top for spring and summer! The fabric is so soft, lightweight and comfortable! I love the look, simple but elegant, good for work, dress up or down with jewelry or switch from skirt to jeans for a completely different look! This washes well ad hasn't shrunk or faded, but I did only wash once before hanging it back up to wear when the weather warms up. The top part is a little 'holey' but skin color bra straps don't show through.",
Levia B.,Effortless Style with a Comfortable Fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RS6WKBNLNSV2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP1YWCGV,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 3, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Navy Blue,,"I really like how this pleated midi dress balances casual and polished. The lapel collar and V-neck give it a more dressed-up feel, but the soft pleats and flowy fit keep it comfortable and easy to wear all day. The mid-length sleeves are perfect for those in-between days when it’s not quite hot but not cool enough for long sleeves. The color is beautiful and versatile, easy to pair with a scarf or dress down with sandals. This dress works for everything from family dinners to quick outings to the park with the grandkids, and it’s comfortable enough to keep up with all the activity in between. It’s definitely staying in my wardrobe rotation.",

It’s unique with the crocheted neckline and shoulders. The color is a very pretty blue and the material is soft against my skin. It’s thin enough to layer during cooler months and I’ll be able to wear it for a variety of occasions. It fits a little boxy and I could have ordered a size smaller for a more flattering fit. Overall, a chic and versatile top.",

I normally order a large, but this is more like an XL, so really looks too baggy, doesn’t look good, which is a shame, as it is a nice top.",

The color is just like the picture, and like I mentioned, the quality is top notch. The material is smooth and soft and has a little bit of weight to it. It runs very slightly large but not enough for me to size down.",
