That meant all of my XXL clothing now fit like a circus tent.  Replacing an entire wardrobe, including jeans, pants, shorts, work shirts, etc. is expensive, so price was a motivating factor.  Most of what I wear is just pocket t-shirts, because I'm a regular casual guy.  So I bought the Hanes Men's Cotton Crew Neck Pocket T-Shirt pack.These t-shirts are paper-thin.  Even after washing, they are not the thick Hanes shirts of the old days.  The colors are flattering, and the price is great, but you definitely get what you pay for here.  Fine to maybe wear as an undershirt, but pretty weak as your only t-shirt.  Also, the sleeves are pretty short, even by t-shirt standards.  Fine for me, because I'm trying to show off the new bod, but for most people I think they would probably be a hair shorter than preferred.Three stars because they are a value for the money.  I bought 3-4 packs of them because of the price, and because I like the colors included.  Long-term these will definitely NOT be my shirt of choice.",
