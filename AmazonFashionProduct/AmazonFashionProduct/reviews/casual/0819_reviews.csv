I’m not sure if it will snag easily. We will see when I wear it to an event. I am only 5’1 so I was concerned whether the dress would be too long on me since a lot of people in the reviews were considerably taller, but I think with heels I can pull it off OK. I tried to show in the photo where it lands at the top of my ankle to give you a reference for your height. The sleeves are a little bit long they do tend to bunch up at the elbow a little bit. But I think I can tolerate it. I purchased the gray with the white stripes. I like the way it brings out the silver in my hair. I plan on wearing it with cherrywood accessories. It looks very nice together. The style looks very classic rather than faddish so dress should last for quite some time. It’s very comfortable. I did wear it with a spankx which made it more comfortable since it is form fitting. I would recommend this purchase. It says it may be hand washed machine washed that it needs to be washed and warm water under 30°C. I will probably end up washing it on cold in my machine on gentle and hope for the best the fabric does seem like it’s fairly decent quality.",9

This dress is incredibly baggy in the armpits, and there are no pleats in the skirt section so it looks like a stretched out and wrinkled mess. Not sophisticated at all I would say.
