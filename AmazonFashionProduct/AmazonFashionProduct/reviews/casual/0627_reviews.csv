They are very comfortable. I mainly wear them around the house and for doing easy yard work. I have laundered them a few times and they have held up well. The shorts are knee length on me and have a generous fit. The elastic waist is perfect and has not rolled over as some do. The shorts are a very casual style so work well with a t-shirt. They are thick enough to wear well over time without being too heavy. The only negative I have is with a flaw in the stitching at the cuff area. One of the cuffs is sewn twisted so it cannot lie completely flat unless I re-sew it, but it’s also not very visible so I have no redone it. For the price I am pleased.",2
