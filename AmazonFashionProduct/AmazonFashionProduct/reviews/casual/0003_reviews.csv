Barbara T.,Just arrived today and I hope it lives up to deserve my five stars,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6QHUHGQ1RG9L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHV257GS,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Color: 1-black StripeSize: Large,Verified Purchase,Perfect Flattering fit! I love the stripes so the pattern is beautiful. I love the V-neck for comfort and makes you look taller. I will even wear it to the gym with the black yoga pants I bought on Amazon. It’s lovely enough for casual wear. It’s long enough to wear over yoga pants.,
Queen,Cute and light weight,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IIHJZN54J5DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHV257GS,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: 0-blackSize: Small,Verified Purchase,Love this shirt! Very light weight and soft. I bought a small and it’s on the large side however it looks adorable tucked in the front and paired with skinny jeans and black booties.,
Amazon Customer,Very long,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XIVNMCD2NBNP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHV257GS,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Color: 1-white StripeSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"The fabric isn’t great but that wasn’t a deal breaker for me, however, the length was. I wanted to partially tuck it in like in the picture shown, but the shirt is too long by quite a bit so it looked bad. If you want to wear it long over leggings it would be perfect and very cute because it’s notched at the bottom hem near the seam.",

Look closely at the photo and you'll see what a great design it is and how incredibly flattering. Keeping the black and white and ordering more colors. I love them,

Amy,Color is off,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XRA8ELLP20WM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHV257GS,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: 2-turquoiseSize: X-Large,,"I ordered an XL size. I recently lost weight and can now fit a Large. I'm torn as to what would work best with my body.  I carry a pouch under my belly button; but the xl carries too much material on the sides for my liking. If I went down to a L-size, the sides would fit better,  but I'm afraid the material would hug my pouch and show the imprint of my belly button.  It's a nice top. It feels good and soft.  I do think the color is off. I think I ordered a teal;  but I feel there is too much blue in the shade, that I wouldn't say that it is a teal. I think the price is low enough that you can figure what sixes you fit and order different colors.",
WY Gadget Girl,Runs a bit Small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVJK5BK24H9VF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHV257GS,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: 2-turquoiseSize: XX-Large,,"I really like the flattering style and comfort of this casual top! But it may be worth sizing up a size. Mine fits on the small side in the arms and tummy area, and this top doesn't have much stretch, which wouldn't make it any more comfortable anyway.  The fabric is heavy enough that it's not see-through, yet lightweight enough for comfort. The price of $12.99 at the time I ordered is reasonable, and there were several great color options. I might go back and order more colors, but I will size up!",

The shirt fit well in the length and bust but my wife mentioned that the little cap sleeves had a weird fit and she didn’t like that but overall the shirt was well made and had a good fit.",
El Jrad,Runs small and kind of flimsy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZYLR7CJSEJVZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHV257GS,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: 1-pink StripeSize: Medium,,This tshirt is ok. It's just an average tshirt. It does feel a little on the flimsy side and not super high quality. It also runs small based on the sizing chart. It also lost some of its softness after I washed it. That was disappointing. It's lightweight so it will be perfect for summer.,
Becky,Cute basic tee,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2E8WO7W1G4NFV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHV257GS,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Color: 1-pink StripeSize: Medium,,"I ordered this shirt in a Medium with Pink Stripes.

It appears to be well-constructed.  My only issue is that the material is too thin for my preference.  I never found it appealing to have a shirt that could be seen through, and required a covering over or under.  The fit was impeccable.",

The shirt is adorable and I love the color too. It fits very well and doesn't cling to every bump. The material will wash wonderfully and not dry full of wrinkles either which is yet another blessing. I can't wait for Spring and Summer because I can't wear this in the rain and that is all we are getting here right now and it is sooo cold.  Looking at the material and the craftsmanship, it is really well made too. Thank you.",

Right length, right fit, great color. The length hits me the same as the model in the picture, but it's also worth noting that I'm short (5'1""), so if you are of average height, it will probably be a little shorter. Fabric is not sheer, but still lightweight. Nice stretch, smooth feel.",
