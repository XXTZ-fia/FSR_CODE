The VILOCY Men’s Casual Dress Sneakers looked great online but when I got them, they felt cheap and flimsy. The mesh material is incredibly stiff and uncomfortable against the foot. I tried wearing them to work and within hours, my feet were sore and aching. The insole felt like it was made of cardboard and provided no support. On top of that, the shoes started to lose their shape after just a few days of wearing them. The stitching came loose in some areas and they just don’t hold up like they should. They might look stylish but I would not recommend these if you’re looking for comfort or durability. Definitely returning these.",2
