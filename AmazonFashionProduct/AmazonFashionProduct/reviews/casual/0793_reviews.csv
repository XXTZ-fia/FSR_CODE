It’s thin, really thin and looks like that inexpensive chenille weave that you sometimes see on pj’s.  Ick.  The quality just isn’t here.  The fit is loose but to be frank, I didn’t even try this on because I was so turned off by the appearance so can’t speak to the comfort of it.  Looks like a pj top.  Disappointed.",

Alise Orloff,"Lovely, Soft AUTOMET Long Sleeve Sweatshirt!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YHVC5N2GP1YQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5J2GH6T,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 7, 2024",Color: Blue Pink NutmegSize: Large,,"I thought this AUTOMET top looked really pretty when I first saw it on Amazon, so I ordered it. When it arrived, I was immediately struck by the fact that it is even prettier in person! The pastel colors, (pink, blue and nutmeg) are vivid and go together beautifully. The rayon/polyester/spandex blend is so soft, that it feels like silk against the skin. The fabric blocked colors have a sort of ribbing which is a lighter shade of each blocked color. The crew neck is the same color as the top color of the top, while the hem has the same color as the bottom portion of the top. Adding further interest to this unusual geometric pattern, is that each sleeve cuff is the color of the blocked color nearest to it- (I hope that makes sense!) At any rate, it is a lovely top, and I will get a lot of wear from it! Also, it can be hand or machine washed, or dry cleaned, if preferred.  This top fits me well; I am 5'4,"" and 120 lbs. I ordered the large for a bit of extra room, and it fits beautifully, with a bit of room to spare. The sleeves are a tiny bit long, but can easily be rolled up. The blocked colors are actually sewn together from the inside, so the outer portion of the top has a smooth look and texture.  The fabric is thin, so this top would be best suited for spring/fall seasons. However, it can be worn on top of another shirt/top for extra warmth in the winter. It is lighter than most sweatshirts, and can be paired with jeans, leggings, dress pants and casual skirts.  I highly recommend this lovely top, and expect to get lots of compliments when I wear it during the cooler seasons. It's a delightful addition to any wardrobe!",

Otherwise this wouldn't have fit at all. To be fair, I'm a 2x and I ordered an XL because that's the biggest they had, but given that it's a baggy cut shirt in the photo, I expected that style to affect the size. I thought it would be fitted on me since it's small, but still usable. Instead, it's extremely tight and barely went on at all. I'm losing weight currently so it may be a better fit by the time winter rolls around, but it's not a super thick shirt either, which I expected based on the look. All in all, I say it's a cute top and it looks like the photo in terms of color, but it's not nearly as long as pictured, and definitely runs a little small.",4

I ordered XL, which is my normal size, and while it fits and isn't exactly snug, neither does it have the oversized look on the model, which I was hoping for. It's wearable, and it's cute, but I'd love it if it was larger.  Edited to add: Tried to wear this a couple of hours and it is NOT oversized, I kept having to pull at the band on the bottom because it was riding up. Without the oversized effect, it just doesn't look or feel right.",

I laundered this in cool water and it came out fine.  It was tightly packed in a plastic wrapper and had an odor at first, but it aired out.",
