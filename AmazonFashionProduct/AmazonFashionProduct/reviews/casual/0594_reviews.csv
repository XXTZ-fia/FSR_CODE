The jacket does feel much heavier than other bomber jacket that I have and also seems thicket and warmer to wear.

My reviews are based on specific tests that I conduct, so others may not experience the same results or share the same opinion.  Overview: I was looking for a causal plain black jacket to wear with jeans or chinos and found this product by COOFANDY, which is a trusted brand that I've purchased before.  Negative(s): -Thickness -Weight -Sizing  Do any of the negative(s) affect my overall rating and/or recommendation? No. Although this jacket wasn't quite lightweight and thin, it's still a quality product. It's thicker than a windbreaker, which is usually made of thin, lightweight nylon, the material of the outer layer is like a cotton/polyester blend with a nylon lining. I'm 5'7"" and about 200lbs., and I wear a Medium or Large jacket depending on the style and material. I was expecting this to fit like a windbreaker so I ordered a size Medium, but surprisingly, even though it's thick, the Medium fit perfectly. Depending on how you want this to fit, I suggest staying the same for a slightly standard to baggy fit or a size down for a more fitted look.  Overall, I'm really happy with this product and I would highly recommend this product.",

Nathan K.,"The Look Is Fine, the Feel Gives Me Pause",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IXDE3U7MNI32/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXS621Q,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 6, 2024",Color: Light GreySize: Small,,"Out of the package, this light coat weighs 1 pound 4.25 ounces.  It looks well put together, even on close inspection. The various components are even on both sides, the hems seem good, the ribbing at the bottoms and around the collar is well sewn on. I got the light gray one, and it has the standard sports coat lining in the sleeves, as well as the main body of the item.  I have an odd feeling about the fabric, though. It looks neat enough, though it's a little wrinkled out of the package, but I suspect that an item that's 97% polyester will be fine once washed.  I wish I liked the feel of the outer fabric, in fact, the feel of the piece as a whole. It drapes well enough, so I don't mean the fit. But it just has a very unusual synthetic feel to it that doesn't feel quite right to me. Hopefully, long sleeves underneath will alleviate some of that, but the outside seems like a highly manufactured product, too. I know that sounds strange, given that nearly all our clothing is indeed manufactured, but all I can say is that this jacket gives me a stronger such impression, mostly because of the notably synthetic feel.  Fortunately, before ordering, I looked at their size chart, which says that my 39 chest / 30 waist should take a small (and according to their chart, any chest up to 44 needs a ""small""), so that's what I got, and it fits like my regular medium jackets. So you might want to go down one size from your regular.  My only ""issue"" with this is its unusually synthetic nature. For what it is, they've done a perfectly satisfactory job, so 4 stars seems fair in view of everything.",
tlb,Stylish quality jacket,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1616N3XVK3NLN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXS621Q,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 6, 2024",Color: CreamSize: Medium,,"To start with I am 5' 10"" tall, 160 lbs., 34 waist and I got the medium jacket in khaki color.  Before I get to what I like about the jacket, I wanted to mention the color is not khaki and looks more like a cream color to me.  The shorts that I'm wearing are khaki so you can compare the difference.  And for the record, I don't dislike the color but wanted to point the difference out.On to what I like about this jacket and why I would recommend it.  There are numerous colors to choose from so no problem getting one that fits into your wardrobe.  I also like the color contrast between the jacket, the elastic waist,  collar and cuffs which make for an attractive and stylish jacket.I ordered medium and you will see by my pics that the sleeves bunch up a bit at the wrist.  That is okay though because there is plenty of room when you are moving around, driving the car, etc.  If you prefer a slim fit Jacket perhaps a size smaller might be considered.  Also, I like that the waist comes down a little further so when I sit down the jacket will not ride up my back.Side pockets are a good depth as well as the inside pocket which holds my 6.5 inch phone perfectly.  None of the pockets have zippers.The material is soft and has a little bit of stretch to it and can be machine washed.  The jacket is a bit heavier than an unlined jacket and should definitely keep you comfortable on those colder Spring/Fall days.Coofandy did a respectable job with this jacket and sells it for a competitive price.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the market for this style jacket.",

When you slip it on it has a soft silky feel to it and it seems extremely lightweight yet it also has a subtly solid vibe to it as well. The sleeves are substantial. I just dig the heft of them.  I ordered it in green. I love the dark accents on the collar and at the wrists. It fits perfectly to my size. The sleeves are just the right length and that is a rare thing to experience because I have long arms and expect the cuffs to ride up on me and these don't. Not tight around the torso either as some of these kinds of jackets can be. I appreciate that.  Very pleased with this well made outerwear. Perfect for spring, fall, and those cool summer nights.",

The color is lovely, light and it goes with practically everything. The neck is a good size even when fully zipped up. The sleeves are the correct length, not too long nor so short that his wrists are showing.  The light green fabric is sorta pebbly, like fabric gravel, I know that isn't the correct word to use for this, it is the opposite of smooth, but it isn't woven looking. Sorry, I am running out of adjectives today .  The lining is smooth and satin-y looking and it went through the washing machine on cool and then into the dryer for just 25 minutes on low heat, it was still damp, but I don't want it to shrink.",

Considering the price point, it is a worthy replacement for casual circumstances or my intended use which is as a lightweight, short length car coat.The construction appears to be as expected – color-matched stitching was strong and straight on all seams.  Elastic at the waist, sleeve ends, and neck well attached with no bunching. Color-matched zipper of plastic material operated freely in both directions.  Has an inside left-breast pocket large enough for a regular sized cell phone.  Outside pockets large enough for a man-sized hand but no more.  Not particularly deep and no zipper, Velcro, or other closure.Came fairly wrinkled but pressed out nicely.  The navy blue color fabric and elastic is quite dark.  Interior lining is black.  Being a solid color jacket, it is very basic looking.  I like it but the wife describes it as bland.  The fabric appears to be sturdy but being polyester does have a budget feel to it.For size comparison, I am 6’1” and typically wear a dress shirt with a 20” neck and 36 inch sleeve length.  For pants it is a 54” waist. The 2x size I got fit me comfortably everywhere except the mid-section (belly).  If, like me, your mid-section is a victim of significant consumption of grain-based adult beverages such that it is materially larger in diameter than your waist, take that into consideration when looking at the seller size chart and purchasing this jacket.  I could not zip mine at all (and it was not close).  For me, this is not an issue as I don’t normally wear jackets zipped when driving but if you expect to wear it zippered, take note.  Objectively, it appears to run accurate to the size chart in the product description.All in all, for what I expect to use it for the jacket is satisfactory and does not break the budget.  Certainly not on the same level as the one it replaced but not near the cost either.  I do not expect to get 15 years of wear out of it either but it does feel, at least initially, that I should last several seasons at a minimum.  Of courts I have only had it a week and therefore, cannot really opine on durability in regular use.Considering price, features, construction, and appearance, a 4 to 4.5 star item.  Since there are no half-stars in Amazon land, it gets a solid 4.DISCLAIMER:  I am a member of the Amazon Vine program.  This means that I receive some products free of charge to use and review.
