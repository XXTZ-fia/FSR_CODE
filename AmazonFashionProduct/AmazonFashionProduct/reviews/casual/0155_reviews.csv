cehrshark,First experience with Coofandy didn't disappoint.  Awesome shirts!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BQ1KES1GHZW3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPTHL7KT,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 5, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Light Green,Verified Purchase,"I was initially skeptical about Coofandy due to the extensive publicity and the use of top models who make everything look amazing. Additionally, the mixed reviews about product quality made me hesitant. Having never purchased a shirt from them before, I was unsure about the sizing, especially since the models, who appeared more muscular than me, often wore size M, while I typically wear size L.  With an upcoming vacation and a desire for stylish beachwear, I decided to take a chance on Coofandy’shirts that I could wear with a Panama hat. So I decided to order this light green linen shirt size L (I am 168 cm, 5 ft 6 inches tall, 87 kg/191.8 pounds, with a chest measurement of 43"" and shoulders 19.5""). To my pleasant surprise, the experience was fantastic. The size was true to my measurements, despite the somewhat misleading size chart and the significant margin of error they mention (up to 3 cm!).  The quality of the shirt is superior, trendy, and fits me perfectly. The fabric is light, not hot and it's going to feels nice while at the hot beach weather. The color is not so green as in the photos on the website, but still is pleasant. I am thoroughly satisfied with Coofandy and highly recommend their products. However, I do suggest that the company provide more detailed information about the models’ measurements to better guide customers in their choices. Thank you, Coofandy! It’s clear that your efforts are not just about publicity but genuinely about “making style simple,” as your slogan says.",26

However, I decided to give this shirt a try, and to my surprise, it's a great fit, comfortable, and I believe it looks good on me. Encouraged by this, I ordered three more in different colors. I chose size XX Large, and they fit perfectly. As someone who usually wears t-shirts and jeans, I appreciate the shirt's simple design and solid color. The fabric is lightweight, which is ideal for Florida's summer heat. After about eight washes, I'm writing this review, and I'm pleased to report that the shirts have neither lost any buttons nor have any loose threads, which speaks well for their quality and consistency, especially since all four shirts have held up well in the wash and dryer without any problems.",10
