The fabric feels cheap and prone to wrinkling, requiring constant ironing to maintain a presentable appearance. The cut is unflattering, with an ill-fitting shape that lacks structure and does not enhance the wearer’s silhouette. After a few washes, the color faded unevenly, and the material began to pill, further detracting from its professional look. Additionally, the top’s design is uninspired and lacks the sophistication needed for a business casual wardrobe. Overall, this top does not provide the quality or style required for a polished business casual outfit.",4

The quality of the fabric is very poor; it feels flimsy and cheap, almost like it would tear easily after a few washes. Additionally, the stitching was uneven and there were loose threads all over the shirt.  The fit was another major issue. Despite ordering my usual size, the shirt was too tight in some areas and too loose in others. The shoulders were narrow and restrictive, while the torso area was baggy and unflattering. The sleeves were also awkwardly long, making the overall fit look sloppy.  The product photos were quite deceiving, as the shirt looked stylish and well-made online, but in person, it's a completely different story. I would not recommend this shirt to anyone looking for a reliable and well-fitting piece of clothing. Save your money and look elsewhere.",8
