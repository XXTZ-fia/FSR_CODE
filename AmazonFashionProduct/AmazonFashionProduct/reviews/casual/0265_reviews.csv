I love the color and fit. It’s super soft and will be nice for the mild SoCal winters. Problem is the very deep crease across the middle of the sweater that I’m not sure will ever come out. Another reviewer commented on this issue and after washing and drying it did not come out. I am going to think about whether I keep this one or not.,10

I’m a sucker for a chunky, oversized knit, and this one did not disappoint. From the girly color, to the fabric, and even the fit. This piece is a bit big on me so I definitely could’ve sized down to a small and still had plenty of space to play around with, but I went with my normal size (medium) and absolutely love the roominess of it. The material is comfortable and light on the skin. I don’t feel any itchiness…not even at the seams. I haven’t worn it out, so I’m unsure if I’ll sweat in it yet. The arms are somewhat long, but I like that because I don’t care for my hands to be too exposed during the colder months anyway. The longer sleeves just provide a little bit of extra warmth. This sweater seems like it’s meant to be somewhat of a longer/wider “crop” top. Since it does run big it actually falls further than my hips. I just tuck it in at the front so it looks super cute and trendy. For reference I’m 5’3”, 152 lbs and 36C.",32
