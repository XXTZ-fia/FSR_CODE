Here's a revised version for clarity and readability:  ---  Review: This review is not about the product itself, which was of decent quality. I originally ordered a medium, which turned out to be too small. I returned it and ordered an extra-large, but it was too big, so I returned that as well. They initially credited my account but later claimed I never sent the item back and charged my card again.  I provided all the tracking information I had and reached out to customer service multiple times, but I never received a response. Ultimately, they charged my card, and I lost $30. It's extremely upsetting that despite my efforts to resolve this, they never responded.",
