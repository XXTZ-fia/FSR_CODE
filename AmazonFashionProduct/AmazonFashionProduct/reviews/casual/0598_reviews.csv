Fit is good; I typically wear a large and this fits well, except the sleeve length is just a bit short. Not really noticeable to someone looking at it, but I can feel the difference.  Personal preference only.  It's not overly warm, which is a good thing. It's a nice layer over a polo or t-shirt.",

Still a bit stiff, but it's also the reason why it ""looks"" good and unwrinkled. I think this is a good addition to my wardrobe.",

The quarter zip gives you options on how to wear it. I ordered  an XL as I wanted to ensure it fits well over any shirt and the fit is perfect for me. I have two minor issues that prevents me from giving it 5 stars and they are that it does not have any pockets and it does show some wrinkles. The tag says not to tumble dry, but I put it in the dryer on delicate cycle to help remove the wrinkles and I did not see any adverse effects to the shirt.",6

The long sleeves and casual quarter-zip style make it versatile for various occasions, from a casual day out to a crisp morning walk. The stitching is excellent, ensuring durability and adding to the overall quality of the pullover. Moreover, the stark white color adds a crisp, clean look that is both classic and contemporary.  I've purchased other Coofandy products and have been underwhelmed. This pullover is a nice upgrade!",

Personally I like the fabric because it helps to block out the wind and is somewhere between a thick sweatshirt and a thin t-shirt material. It is not bulky and great for my needs. I only weigh 145 lb and the size small fits me perfectly.,

We both have sensory sensitivities - relatively mild in both cases, but we both also see no reason whatsoever to wear things that are even a little uncomfortable because why would anybody do that to themselves?  So this isn't soft. The fabric is thick, and it will be quite warm - warmer than it looks. The construction is good as far as I can see - no red flags to the non-expert eyes, at least. The blue color is beautiful, vibrant but not screaming bright, and in general I and my spouse would both be fans if it were just a little less stiff and a little softer.  The price is pretty low for what you're getting, though, especially again in terms of the potential warmth factor, so if you don't have sensory issues (or plan to wear it with long sleeves - the neck didn't bother him), this might not be a bad risk, especially if returns are easy in your area.",

The pullover is made of okay material and the construction is good, so I debated between 3 and 4 stars and opted for the latter because I think that this is a good brand and that some might like this pullover, it's just not good for me.",

As someone who appreciates comfort and style, this lightweight mock neck sweatshirt has quickly become a go-to piece for me.  The first thing that stood out was the fabric. It's soft, skin-friendly, and breathable, providing a comfortable wearing experience throughout all seasons. I’ve worn it in cooler weather and layered it under a jacket when it got really cold. It resists shrinkage and wrinkles, which is a big plus for me because I’m not a fan of ironing.  The design is another aspect I love. The quarter zip adds a touch of versatility and makes it easy to adjust based on the weather or my activity level. The polo collar and ribbed cuffs give it a refined look, while the solid color design keeps it classic and timeless. I chose a versatile color that pairs well with almost everything in my closet.  Matching this pullover with different outfits has been a breeze. I’ve worn it with jeans for a casual look and paired it with slacks for a more polished appearance at work. It also looks great with shorts and linen pants, making it a versatile piece for various occasions. Whether I’m heading to a casual dinner or a business meeting, it fits the bill perfectly.  One of the standout features is its suitability for various occasions. I’ve worn it for daily activities, work, and even on a couple of weekend trips. It's lightweight enough to wear during spring and fall, but it also works as a layering piece in winter. The mock neck adds a bit of extra warmth without being too stifling.  Maintenance has been straightforward. I've machine washed it several times, and it has maintained its shape and color beautifully. I appreciate that it’s easy to care for—no special treatment needed.  Overall, the COOFANDY Men's Quarter Zip Up Pullover is a great blend of comfort, style, and functionality. It’s a versatile addition to any wardrobe, and I’m extremely happy with my purchase. If you’re looking for a casual yet stylish pullover that can be dressed up or down, I highly recommend giving this one a try.",2

While the shirt is machine washable, be sure to avoid tumble drying as indicated in the care instructions. Any way you launder it, it is prone to wrinkles--perhaps not as much as some shirts but still enough to be noticeable.  The fabric is neither particularly soft nor stiff, but the collar manages to be uncomfortably rigid. I found the shirt lacking in breathability. The inside of the shirt feels quite itchy against the skin, requiring me to wear an undershirt WITH sleeves. Tolerable for casual daily wear on laundry days, its overall appearance does not inspire me to wear it to work.",3
