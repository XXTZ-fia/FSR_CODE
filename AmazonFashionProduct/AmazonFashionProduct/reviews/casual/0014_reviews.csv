Annie B.,"Comfortable, Perfect Length",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MH15JX6MRTTB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMVFCM9,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Color: WineredSize: Large,,"This shirt is so comfortable! I also love the stitching detail on the front. The color is accurate to the listing, and the fit is accurate as well. The fabric is thin and breathable which will be nice for hot weather. Even though the fabric is thin, it doesn’t seem too clingy.  I got size XL, I’m 5’5”, 160 lbs.",

Mimi Davis,Nice basic t-shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1N7DZ526X8438/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMVFCM9,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: NavySize: Large,,"This is a pretty t-shirt with a little angled texture across the front for interest. The navy is actually a light heather blue that is pretty and versatile. I did not include a photo because the pictures I took could not capture the color well.  I ordered the large, and it fits me as most large t-shirts do. It is straight down the sides and is not form-fitting. That works for me, as I am large-busted and generally larger than I want to be, so I don't really want a shirt to fit my form as it is now. I like a looser fit. I have a long torso, and this hits me about halfway across my rear. It's not a bad length for me.  The material is a soft and comfortable combination of polyester, rayon, and spandex. I don't get a lot of shirts that include rayon because it sometimes pills after washing, but since I started hanging all of my t-shirts to dry, that is no longer much of a problem. I have not yet washed this shirt.  Overall, I like this shirt.",
Cindy Quijano,Quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M70COE1BUVUQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMVFCM9,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: LightgreenSize: Medium,,Love the color and the fabric is butter soft!,
Southern Belle,Sort and Subtly Different,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V0FCD18BPI0J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMVFCM9,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Color: WineredSize: X-Large,,"Who doesn’t need another good tee shirt?  I especially liked this one because it is a little different than most, not your typical tee.  This one has two seams stitched across the front, giving it a more unique appearance, and the bottom hem is slightly curved.  The length, additionally, is a bit longer than most tees but not quite long enough to wear as a tunic.  The fabric is quite soft.  I ordered the XL, which is my typical shirt size, which keeps it from being too snug.  I’m very pleased to add this to my rotation of casual summer clothing.  Five stars!!I hope you found this review to be helpful.  Thanks for reading!!",
Peggy,Cute and flattering,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NRLLV3117L7R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMVFCM9,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Color: LightgreenSize: Large,,"I ordered the light green, and the color is beautiful. I love how those diagonal lines sewn in the front sort of dress it up a bit, and it looks more stylish than a regular t-shirt. I ordered a L and am 5'10"" and 130 lbs. and the fit is perfect. I hate tops that are too tight and show every bulge and roll. I would like to get this shirt in every color available. It is easy wash and dry, 82% polyester, 12% rayon and 6% spandex. This shirt is perfect for my hot summers or with a sweater in cooler weather. 5 stars.",
Always a mom,"Soft, cute design lines, flowy",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQAIDIH6ERNQO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMVFCM9,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Color: LightgreenSize: Large,,"I'm overweight so I like tops that are not tight in the stomach area and this t-shirt works for me! It's wrinkled from shipping in the photo but I ran it through the washer (cold, in a laundry bag) and hung it up to air dry and it came out fine and unwrinkled. Love the lines going across the front!",
Notsonewtothis,Women's Short Sleeve T-shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U0LT3BCLRH7I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMVFCM9,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Color: BlackSize: X-Large,,"Great Short Sleeve T-shirt. It fits great. It's long enough to wear with leggings and short enough to wear with jeans. This looks really nice on and the material is really soft, not too heavy, and it's breathable. This is a polyester, rayon, spandex mix, and is not machine washable, it's hand wash only. The material is not heavy it's very lightweight. I would buy this item again it's worth the money spent",
Ellen Muth,This fabric is AMAZING,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EP7NTGFXH9OG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMVFCM9,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Small,,"My favorite t-shirts are by a designer that charges far too much money for a t-shirt but having tried on this t-shirt made me realize how much the other designer is over charging because this shirt feels identical to James Perse tees. It's light weight and silky/slinky feeling. It is flattering to all body types due to it's ability to avoid hugging any love handles. It's still flattering but to the right areas. I also like that it's a crewneck, as opposed to a V-neck, as too many shirts and sweaters are these days. I could definitely buy more of these in different colors. Comfort and style!",
Eldee S. Dates,Comfortable Short Sleeve Shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNC9F677PBV05/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMVFCM9,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Color: WineredSize: Medium,,"This short sleeve casual shirt is comfortable and works well for easy wearing.  It is somewhat stretchable and has some decorative stitching at the top.  The top is a little smaller than the width at the bottom so it kind of flares on a thinner person, this may be either due to the decorative stitching or the style.",

Stan,Very soft material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2B36H8CDQAUDN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMVFCM9,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Color: LightgreenSize: Large,,"This blouse was really comfortable having the most soft material.  It had some stitching on the front to add interest to the design of the blouse.  The stitching was done well using a stretch stitch that just moves with you.  It hangs very nice allowing you to tuck It or let it hang outside.  Either way, it looks great!",
