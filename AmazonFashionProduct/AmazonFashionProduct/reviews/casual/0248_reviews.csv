Great price and water and wind resistant. Zipper is well made and doesn't stick. I wasn't disappointed with the cost/quality. Only issue I had was sizing. I purchased a medium which fits like a large/tall. Sleeve lengths are pretty long and result in the coat looking very oversized. My hands were completely developed in the sleeves and I looked like a kid wearing his dad's coat. A smaller size mostly fixed the issue.,
