JTGE,great fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5W8NZ734LAK2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMV69ZW9,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: KhakiSize: Large,,"I was pleasantly surprised at how well this fit. It is very soft and comfortable and the material is thick enough that my bra didn’t show through it. No transparency. The color is a true white and it lays nicely. It is very versatile in that you can wear it alone or with a vest or jacket over it. I will say it does run larger. I typically order a large because I don’t like a tight fit and I’m a little on the busty side. I had read in the reviews that it ran large so I ordered a medium and a large just to compare. I am sending the large back. The medium definitely fit easily. So, order a size down from what you typically wear. I really am pleased with this shirt.",

I received the color blue stripe. The colors were vibrant and pretty. I love the thick cuffs at the neckline and on the sleeves. The shirt seems to be of the highest quality and materials.

This shirt is quite large on me. I should've ordered a small.,

It would have been a very comfy top to lounge in if not for the way the sleeves are stitched together under the pits. It almost feels like hard little knobs that poke at you every time you put your arms down. Honestly, it got kind of painful after a while. I’ve never felt anything like it. I wish the brand had just sewn the sleeves normally because it really impacts how long I can tolerate wearing this t-shirt.  It does fit well and true to size, and I found that the color was a good match for the product photos. Looks cute tucked into shorts or jeans.",
