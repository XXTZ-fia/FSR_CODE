The top isn't bad, but both pieces are just thin knit, and the pants are especially unattractive- the picture makes these look like leggings but they are not. The knit fabric bags and sags and these just look like pajama pants, which is what I am wearing them for. I am wearing this set as pajamas and am disappointed, as they are described as leggings but don't fit that way at all. I would not have ordered these and find them expensive and not overly comfortable to be wearing as pajamas.",3
