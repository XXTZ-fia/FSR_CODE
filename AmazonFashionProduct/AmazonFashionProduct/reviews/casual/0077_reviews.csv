I’ve worn it with joggers and it’s cozy, and I’ve worn it tucked into high-waisted wide-leg pants for a more polished look - it’s so versatile. My favorite thing about it is the ribbed material - it adds texture and interest to elevate it just enough to be more than just a great basic. I’m impressed by the quality. Will definitely be buying more colors.",2
