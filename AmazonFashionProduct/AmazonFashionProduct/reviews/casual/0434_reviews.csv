I measure the person to be sure of bust size, used the size chart and ordered a size large -- which was 2 inches larger in the bust.  It was too small.  The other thing is that it doesn't include hip size in the chart.  Although the person is in average proportion, it was way, way too small over the top of the hips.  If you get an accurate bust size, it might be good if you have a straight line figure.  But if you have any curve, good luck!  I was disappointed because it is pretty.",

The design is stunning, with vibrant floral patterns that add a touch of elegance to any outfit. The sleeves give it a trendy and feminine look, while the loose fit makes it incredibly comfortable to wear.  It’s lightweight and perfect as a cover-up during warm weather or for layering over a tank or tee on cooler days. The fabric drapes beautifully and feels soft against the skin. I’ve worn it casually with jeans and dressed it up for evenings out, and it works perfectly for both.  This cover has become a staple in my wardrobe, and I’ve received so many compliments on it. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a stylish and versatile piece!",7
