I'm 5'9"" 165lb, ordered in 33"" inseam. I guess I have a larger hip/thigh area because I cannot wear normal pants as they are so tight in the crotch. These are so perfect for me, and provide all day comfort in and out the office. I had 3 pairs previously and noticed that there was some slight shrinkage, weirdly in the inseam. So this time I'm going to be extra careful and only use the recommended washing settings (shoulda done that anyways).  I highly recommend these.",
