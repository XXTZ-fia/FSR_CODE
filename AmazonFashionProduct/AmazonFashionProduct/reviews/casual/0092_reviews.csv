However, the garment has a label that says 100% rayon. Quite a difference, not even close.  Second, the garment has no washing or drying instructions in garment .It is on on the page I ordered from, , but the material is completely different so not sure. Most rayon materials do not go in the washing machine..  I do like the fit of the shirt for the most part - it is oversized , but it is particularly baggy around the waist and I have a little pouch. I bought it in my usual size large. I’m afraid the hem of it is going to stretch out after a while. The material is very soft and thin, not a sweater material at all, very thin almost like a thin summer weight t shirt.  Complete misrepresentation from the advertisement of the material, saying that it’s a sweater as well as no instructions at all to wash. How is that so difficult to do?. And the material is not what was mentioned.  I’m keeping it because I live in Florida and I could still wear this ,just not in cool weather. The price was right but now I know why. I don’t think I got the product that I originally ordered at all, because it took a long time to get here as well.",2

R.M.S.,Works in so many ways,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Y8L0R8Z9N35Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJ2D6QHW,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2023",Color: Black White ApricotSize: Medium,,"This sweater works in so many ways, my favorite way to wear it is with a nice pair of jeans, for an afternoon look. It is just a little wide on the sides, which makes it hang really nice without being too baggy.  The seams at the shoulders hang just slightly to the side for a nice look.  When it's a little cooler out, I like wearing it with a black hoodie or even a black blazer, creating a completely different, evening look.  It's a very comfortable knit, even without an undershirt.  Really like this sweater, definitely getting it in other colors.",
Amanda W.,LOVE this sweater!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HMNFCZE9AEPZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJ2D6QHW,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 11, 2023",Color: White BlueSize: Medium,,I absolutely love this sweater! It can easily be a 4 season sweater. It’s super soft and lightweight and well made. It fit perfectly for that cozy look without looking oversized or sloppy. It’s long enough in the back that you can get away with pairing it with leggings.,2
avidreader,Just ok,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26BPT8GLCKIUU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJ2D6QHW,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 6, 2023",Color: Black White ApricotSize: Medium,,Nothing super special about this one.  It's really thin but will be a good fall/spring top with black cropped pants and flats.  Kind of giving Parisian vibes so I plan to wear with my new Amazon trench coat (see my review!).,
Jennifer C.,Fall must have,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R332VH82YO8MRY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJ2D6QHW,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 6, 2023",Color: Brown White OrangeSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"This sweater is soft, lightweight and super cute.

cj,Weird length and football shoulders,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27F5F7F4YZDOR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJ2D6QHW,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 1, 2023",Color: Black White OrangeSize: X-Large,,"Loved the stripes and orange-red detail on the sweater I got, but sadly it’s just an awkward fit. The length in front hits right at my hipbones and is slightly longer in the back. Maybe it’s the pear-shaped millennial in me, but I feel like this would be so much cuter in a tunic length. The trendy girlies can probably do a French tuck with this one, but mid-sized mom bod me finds that looks awkward. On top of the weird length, something about the construction of the shoulder seams makes them stick out adding more bulk to my already bulky arms. Sadly, this one is just a “no” for me :(",2
Lindsay,Very comfy and flattering,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37EAO1VBN8E6X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJ2D6QHW,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 31, 2023",Color: Black White OrangeSize: X-Large,,I love this sweater!  I am actually wearing it right now.  It's lightweight so it's not super heavy and the material isn't itchy.  It's a good length but I have a longer torso so I do wish the front was just a little longer.  But other than that it's a great  buy!,
Jensea,Very nice knit and design- only slightly oversized,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HDS23JJDNB76/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJ2D6QHW,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 27, 2023",Color: Black White OrangeSize: Medium,,"This is a find! I love the knit of this Anrabess sweater- It is soft and very comfortable, and I ordered my usual medium size.  This is TTS mostly; I think Anrabess does run a bit large most of the time, since once again with one of their sweaters, I could have gotten away with a small.  For reference I am 5'5"" and 170lbs, medium, hourglass build, (41,31,43) and 36DD.  With a large bust it's never going to fit like it does on the model but it is a great piece regardless. The colors are vibrant and beautiful, the red on this was a bit worrying when I ordered this sweater, it looked washed out and a bit more salmon than red, but upon receiving it it is in fact an orange red, not salmon. I will definitely wear this for work and play, it's a great sweater that fits well and is soft and comfy.",23
