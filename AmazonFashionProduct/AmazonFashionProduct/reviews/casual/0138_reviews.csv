cehrshark,First experience with Coofandy didn't disappoint.  Awesome shirts!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BQ1KES1GHZW3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPTHL7KT,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 5, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Light Green,Verified Purchase,"I was initially skeptical about Coofandy due to the extensive publicity and the use of top models who make everything look amazing. Additionally, the mixed reviews about product quality made me hesitant. Having never purchased a shirt from them before, I was unsure about the sizing, especially since the models, who appeared more muscular than me, often wore size M, while I typically wear size L.  With an upcoming vacation and a desire for stylish beachwear, I decided to take a chance on Coofandy’shirts that I could wear with a Panama hat. So I decided to order this light green linen shirt size L (I am 168 cm, 5 ft 6 inches tall, 87 kg/191.8 pounds, with a chest measurement of 43"" and shoulders 19.5""). To my pleasant surprise, the experience was fantastic. The size was true to my measurements, despite the somewhat misleading size chart and the significant margin of error they mention (up to 3 cm!).  The quality of the shirt is superior, trendy, and fits me perfectly. The fabric is light, not hot and it's going to feels nice while at the hot beach weather. The color is not so green as in the photos on the website, but still is pleasant. I am thoroughly satisfied with Coofandy and highly recommend their products. However, I do suggest that the company provide more detailed information about the models’ measurements to better guide customers in their choices. Thank you, Coofandy! It’s clear that your efforts are not just about publicity but genuinely about “making style simple,” as your slogan says.",26
JC Ricoveri,I loved it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RS6ONSVSKBTB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPTHL7KT,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Pink,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely loved this shirt! The COOFANDY Men's Linen Short Sleeve Casual Shirt is the perfect choice for beach weddings and a variety of everyday occasions. Its lightweight and breathable fabric keeps you comfortable even in warm weather. Made from high-quality linen, this shirt not only looks fresh and stylish but also resists wrinkles, making it an excellent option for travel or long days out. The casual fit allows for easy movement, while the short sleeves offer a relaxed vibe that is perfect for summer outings. Overall, it's a versatile addition to any wardrobe! In fact, I got it in different colors.",
Jake,Great shirt! Almost perfect,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3F3EDM9ZAO8X0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPTHL7KT,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 2, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Light Khaki,Verified Purchase,"recently purchased the COOFANDY Men's Linen Shirt, and I am very pleased with its performance. This shirt is incredibly light and loose-fitting, making it ideal for hot weather. The linen fabric is breathable and comfortable, keeping me cool even on the warmest days. It’s a versatile piece, suitable for casual outings, beach trips, and summer weddings.  One thing to note is that the sleeves are slightly longer and baggier than I personally prefer. However, this doesn't detract much from the overall quality and comfort of the shirt. The craftsmanship and attention to detail are evident, with well-stitched buttons and a nice finish.  Overall, this shirt is a great addition to any summer wardrobe, offering a stylish and comfortable option for various occasions. Highly recommended!",11
T. Gaydos,"Great fit, appearance, and comfort with surprising stain resistence",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XFQ580ABKDUH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPTHL7KT,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 25, 2024",Size: MediumColor: White-all White,Verified Purchase,"Wearing a light colored shirt out to dinner while on vacation is a bit risky. Is there a good chance I manage to not get wine or food or dessert on it? Yes. Is there a good chance I get one or possibly all three on it? Also yes. So it's important to look good without being too pricey and ideally with the ability to withstand how I am. This shirt hits all of those points.  Now, this is not a fully linen shirt, it's a linen blend that has the appearance of linen. For me, this is perfect because it means most things will wash out if they don't set, it's got a little bit of flex to it, and it doesn't wrinkle quite as easily or severely as linen. The fit is an athletic cut, which is what I was looking for. I'm 5' 10"" 192 lbs, medium frame, but bigger in the shoulders, 33 waist and the Medium was perfect. If you're a larger frame, go larger because the arms were a bit tight.  I have it in white and blue. They were purchased for vacation/beach wear, but I think they may join the spring/supper rotation next year. Definitely a great value for what you get. I've purchased other items in the past from this brand and I've yet to be disappointed. The ""linen"" pants that match these shirts are also highly recommended for all of the same reasons, if you need to complete the look.",11
Todd,Stylish and comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWT4SO9I2OVRV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPTHL7KT,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 4, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Denim Blue,Verified Purchase,"I seldom purchase clothes online due to numerous past disappointments. However, I decided to give this shirt a try, and to my surprise, it's a great fit, comfortable, and I believe it looks good on me. Encouraged by this, I ordered three more in different colors. I chose size XX Large, and they fit perfectly. As someone who usually wears t-shirts and jeans, I appreciate the shirt's simple design and solid color. The fabric is lightweight, which is ideal for Florida's summer heat. After about eight washes, I'm writing this review, and I'm pleased to report that the shirts have neither lost any buttons nor have any loose threads, which speaks well for their quality and consistency, especially since all four shirts have held up well in the wash and dryer without any problems.",10

If you go with a ""standard"" size chart, as opposed to the one shown here ,you should be okay. I'm usually on the border of L and XL and the L fit okay. The cuffs look great in the ad. However, with the first wash, the crease came out a bit limp and uneven. The description does classify them as adjustable, but I don't they'll hold outside of the original crease. On the other hand, after one wash, some of the creases created by folding for packing/shipment remain to some extent. All in all, it's a good shirt for the price.",

It wicks moisture away from the body and allows for excellent airflow. Whether it’s a casual beach outing or a semi-formal dinner, a linen shirt transitions seamlessly. Pair it with chinos or shorts for a relaxed vibe or layer it under a blazer for a polished look. However, its relaxed look can lean toward untidy if not managed well. This is part of the charm for some but may be a downside for those seeking a more crisp appearance.",
