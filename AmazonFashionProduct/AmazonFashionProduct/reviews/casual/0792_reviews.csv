It's winter time so it's not quite the weather for just wearing short sleeves, but the material is nice and soft and the design is pretty. It's been washed and worn at least once so fabric hasn't shrank or degraded which is good. That's pretty much all I can say about that lol",

I am short so it is a little long on me.  I like the printed design and the pleats on the top.  Pouf sleeves are new to me and I'm getting used to them.  The top looks good with jeans and leggings.  With the right pants this top would be appropriate office attire.,

The pleats add a nice touch and the color is really pretty. The sleeves come down over that part of your arm that older women want to hide so it's very flattering. The length is just right too. It's a great summer top that can be worn with jeans, dress pants or skirts for any occasion.",

Katdlove,Pretty flower design,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K6Y0J7NLLQ3T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DL5PZCN3,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Color: Sf31Size: XX-Large,,"This is a pretty shirt, I really like the design of pink flowers falling like snow on the black background. My impression from what I saw on the screen and what it looks like in person is that it is not as pretty in person as it is on the screen. The design does not appear as crisp and vibrant in person as it seemed when I saw the pictures on screen. The material is lightweight and not quite what I expected either. I am simply speaking of my impressions when looking at the shirt online versus the impressions I got when I first opened the package. The impression I get from the picture is that it is a material that might have a flowy  feel, but in real life, it does not feel that way. Also, I am not sure about the pleats across the top, I think they are awkwardly placed for someone who has more than a small chest.",

It is just as shown - not a faded out look at all. The material is soft and size is appropriate (I do always size up though when ordering from Amazaon) The sleeves are maybe a little shorter than I prefer, but not a bad length at all. The cut is flattering - not too boxy or anything. This is an easy top to throw on for a more casual work day or for running about on the weekend. No issues after wash/dry - I did hang mine to dry just because I do with most items. I feel like the top has a unique design without being too busy and you won't see yourself coming and going.",

Easy care, washes and dry beautifully no need to iron and doesn’t shrink. I know this because I tested it to see how it would do. The fit is accurate from what I can tell. It’s one of those tops that you might want to order multiple colors of it. Definitely at a great price point for a really nice quality top.",

My wife is a bargain hunter who rarely likes to spend more than $15 on a blouse; but in this case we went back and bought four more!",
Edavis210,"Nice, casual, light, but the sleeves don't stretch (and they're not large)",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBD34EM68PGYY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DL5PZCN3,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 21, 2024",Color: Bf183Size: Large,,"I recently purchased the Zeagoo Women's Short Sleeve Tops Floral Boho Shirts Pleated Crewneck Summer Outfit Puff Sleeve Blouses Casual Tunic, and I have mixed feelings about it.  The material is light but not transparent, which is great. The colors are good—while not quite as saturated as the photos, they’re very close. The length is a little long, which I didn’t prefer, but I know lots of people like that style. Personally, I could have taken off a good 4 inches at the hem and been happier.  The puff sleeves are a nice touch, but there's no elasticity in the hem, so they don’t stretch at all at the edge. This can be an issue for those with larger upper arms. I have edema from cancer treatment, and the sleeves felt like a tight rubber band on a water balloon, which was quite uncomfortable.  Despite these issues, the shirt is stylish and can be dressed up or down. It’s soft, breathable, and versatile, making it a decent addition to my wardrobe. Overall, I’m giving it 4 stars.",

This will be great in the colder months to wear as a layer, or on its own in the summer.Shipping was really fast, and I was not disappointed.",

I ordered version sf122, which is the pink/white floral with the white at the top and pink more than half the bottom part. It looks just like the pictures and is very comfortable to wear. The fabric is comparable to an extra soft, stretchy t-shirt material, and is on the lightweight side. It's perfect for warmer weather. They did a good job with the sewing, and it's well finished, without any errant threads to trim or pull off. I ordered the large and it's fairly true to size. It fits much like a t-shirt, but the pleats and cuffed sleeves give the top a less casual appearance. This style is versatile enough to wear in work settings, or casually with jeans, shorts, etc. I highly recommend this top for all ages and figures.",5
