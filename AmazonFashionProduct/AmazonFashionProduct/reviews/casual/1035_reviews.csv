Ohjenny,BUY THESE!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6UPCAQBRNAN2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHPMYGCG,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 2, 2025",Color: TaupeSize: Medium Tall,Verified Purchase,"This is the second Amazon item I’ve ordered, if they discontinue I may cry, lol! First, the ‘Tall’ size - this alone makes me want to weep tears of joy. The crazy hunt for reasonably priced pants, offered in ‘tall’ is real. My cold little ankles, in the New England winter, thank you. Profusely.  Then the cut- they’re just perfect. Flat across the tummy, no strings, no pleats, no ruching or extra material. Just nice and flat!! The band at the waist isn’t tighter than the material sewn beneath it, so no weird lumpy look. The butt is just perfect, fitted, not skintight and not baggy. The wide legs are modern, they’re not 6 feet wide, a la 90’s -but still visibly wide leg cut. I haven’t seen this cut NOT flattering on someone yet.  The feel. When you’re working at home, and want to be in your jammies all day- but LOOK presentable, these are IT. No one is going to mistake these for office dress pants, they have sports style stretch stitching on the sides of the legs, but for working from home, running errands, etc.. they look fantastic. The fabric, even though it’s super super stretchy and comfortable, doesn’t have that ‘shine’ to them that some sportswear or yoga gear has- they’re matte. Just gorgeous. The colors on these are also great- I hope this seller keeps adding! I’d love even more neutrals.  In a nutshell, these pants are just about perfect, stop reading reviews and buy them already!!! 😂",

Now I see why people pay over $30 for these pants (when they should be about $10 cheaper). It’s the fit. They look exceptionally good on and are particularly slimming. It’s the perfect wide leg. The waist is somewhat fitted, so if you’re unsure about sizing, definitely go up. I’ve already ordered my 2nd pair!",6
