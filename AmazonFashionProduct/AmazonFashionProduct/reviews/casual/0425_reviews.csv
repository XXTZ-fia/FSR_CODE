It is comfortable and doesn't scratch or feel bad after having it on for a long time.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the price which is outrageous when the same tops are selling for less than half this price which are heavy cotton too. Some of the ones that also sell for too much are not even made of cotton.But you got my sale because it came in Extra Small which is a big plus for small women which there are millions.  Companies need to tap into this very large part of the population.  Just because I am just about 5 ft. and 90 pounds shouldn't mean I can't buy clothing on Amazon.,2

The hem hits below my hips at 26” in length and 22” from armpit to armpit . The hem is just shy of 2.5” thick and the cuffs are 2.5” wide.  The cuffs, neck and hem are all ribbed vertically in a contrasting collar . The stripes on the torso are horizontal . I received the green and tan combination and i really like how the two different colors play off each other. Seller offers other vibrant color choices as well.  The fabric is stated to be comprised of 95%Cotton which provides softness and comfort and the 5% Elastane gives the sweatshirt flexibility and stretch. It is a very comfortable sweatshirt which provides softness and warmth.

These come in several different color combinations, all done in a color block design. This is made by one of my favorite sellers, Prettygarden, and I have a few of their shirts and casual wear that have all held up extremely well and still look wonderful.  This is an oversized sweatshirt, and the size chart on this told me to order a large, which is my usual size. I did, and it fits very well but is still loose and cool and totally comfortable. If I were going to make a sweatshirt, and I have made many of them for children and babies, this sweatshirt's made exactly like I prefer my sweatshirts. Loose fit, something a little different with a black and white striped sweatshirt with medium blue neckline, hem, and cuffs, and keep it simple.  I love the lightweight fabric used to make this sweatshirt, and it's breathable and comfortable, even now on the last day of May, but it hasn't been hot here yet. If you want a looser sweatshirt, you're supposed to order a size up, and it you want a regular fit you should order your usual size. That's what I did, order my usual size, and it fits perfectly.  I would definitely recommend this pretty oversized (if you want) or regular sized sweatshirt; the fabric is comfortable, soft, breathable, and will be great to wear even now until that southern summer weather hits. I love the drop sleeves and the many color combinations, and the sweatshirt feels great on. Fit is true to size, and I hate to see the hot weather roll in since that means I'll have to put this in my closet until September, but who knows? This sweatshirt is made by a very reputable and fashionable company, and the sweatshirt looks in real life just like the one on the page, at least on my computer. Excellent product!",3
