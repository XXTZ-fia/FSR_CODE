It definitely fit like a large, and went to my knees! My husband said it looked like a night gown, I felt like I was about to churn some butter (since the ""cute"" ruffled sleeves looked awful), and the weird stitching in the breast area made it look like a breast feeding/pregnancy dress. Just all around super unflattering and fits nothing like the picture.",

I would say the blue is slightly lighter in person in the pictures but still cute. It's lightweight and soft. I washed it in warm water and dried on medium heat and it did well.  Something about the fit of this doesn't work the best on my apple body shape. Maybe because my rib cage is kind of wide, it just sort of makes me look wider/more rectangle shaped. I think other body shapes would like this more.",4

Before I get to the bad thing between me and this dress. I want to start with the good. The material is nice and the color is true to what you see in the description photos. I don't have any issues with the fit. Overall I think that this dress is a good find for the price. Now, if you are considered above average in bust department, pay attention to this next part. Either get/wear a minimizing bra, or keep searching for a dress. A good friend organizes comedy shows (books venues/talent etc.) and invited me to a show. I ordered this dress to wear to it and didn't get the chance for a final look before heading out. It wasn't until the next day when my friend sent me the photos taken of us with the comedians that I noticed how horrible the dress made me look. And it was mainly because of how my chest looked in the dress. Thank goodness I will probably never see those comedians again.",3
