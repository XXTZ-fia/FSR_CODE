I have found similar looking ones that some brands offer, but never made the purchase because I felt they charged way more for what the shirt was worth (no way I'm playing $30 or more for 1 shirt).  I came across this long-sleeve recently and I was skeptical because it was an Amazon brand product and I wasn't convinced that Amazon could make decent clothing (especially something that I've been looking years for). I ended up ordering 2 black ones anyway because I didn't have anything to lose at this point and reading some of the other reviews gave me some hope.  When they finally arrived, I was surprised on the quality of them. They aren't as thick as my old Faded Glory shirt, but surprisingly they kept me warm and were just the right fit. I'd say they are good enough for anyone who are looking for these types of shirts to give them a try. I'll likely buy a few more in the future as I'm very impress and say the price is worth it  (NOTE: Ordered 2 Large and they are true to fit. I usually wear a large in my other shirts. XL would have been too big and after washing and sending them through the dryer, the shirts DID NOT shrink).",14
