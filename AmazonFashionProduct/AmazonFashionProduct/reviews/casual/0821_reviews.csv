It’s stretchy but returns to its natural form unlike some lower quality shirts. It has almost a silky feel to it.  After washing in cold water and drying on low there was some shrinkage but since the material is quite stretchy it wasn’t really an issue.  Great option if you’re looking for a summer longsleeve!,

It's made of a medium-weight rib knit fabric, which means the white is not see-through at all. The ribbing makes the fabric extra-stretchy. It is a very soft garment. The white is a pure white, no tint at all. The neckline is low, but not cleavage bearing for me. Feminine though.  While the sleeves are long for me, I think they are probably a true size small long sleeve length.  Nice top. Recommend!",3
