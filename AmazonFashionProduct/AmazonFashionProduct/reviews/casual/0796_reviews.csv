The color is vibrant, maybe a bit dark. I hadn't noticed the white piping on it which didn't really help the style in my opinion. That, and the high collar made it look a bit dated to me. Otherwise a great find!",

Good cut and design accents make this an easy choice and I would recommend it.",7

It is on the heavy side of cotton sweaters. Definitely a fall or winter piece. The stitching is all well done and the zipper moves well without catching. The weave is nice and tight and resistant to pulls. Color and size are both as expected from the product pages.,

It's VERY comfortable...it's surprisingly light, it fits true to size, and the color is a nice, rich blue that looks great with anything! It washes and dries nicely, too, which is a plus. Goes great with shorts as a pullover for cooler evenings etc and for jeans/dress pants too. It's made very well too and you can feel the quality of the thread, so I have no doubt this will last for a long time.  Overall, I can't think of anything but good things to say about this pullover. Highly recommend!",

It feels like it should be double the cost. I also like it because it can be worn with jeans or be dressed up for business attire with dress pants. I wear this style of clothing a lot in the winter here in the deep south as you need layers to make it through the day. I am looking forward to cooler weather so I can wear this. I usually wear an XL and bought an XL. It fits but is slightly smaller than most XLs.,

I like the navy blue color and the zipper at the neck. When I ordered it I did not realize that it had white striping on the hem and on the end of the sleeves, which I don't like. Not sure how I missed that when I looked at the amazon page.  My main concern is the bottom hem. I like to wear sweaters that stop at the waist and not just straight down. The hem for this has a little elastic in it but its not going to stay up at my waist but will drop down until its just straight down. Since I had to get a little bigger size do to some extra belly weight, the sweater is long and will drop down pretty far.  Pros: Nicely made, nice color, like the zipper and the way that looks. Cons: The white striping doesn't look good to me and the elastic hem at the waist will not hold it up.",2
