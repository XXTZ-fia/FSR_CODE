The material appears to be very light weight. That being said, the sizing is totally screwed up. I am a small guy and ordered a small shirt. It hangs down to my knees, and when I compared it to a friends 'large', it has the same general width and height. Either the manufacturer has no clue on how to size their items, or the shirt itself was mislabeled. Unless I could get a replacement at a smaller size, I would not purchase another based on this. - as an addendum. I ordered the 'xtra' small and it fits like a small should fit.
