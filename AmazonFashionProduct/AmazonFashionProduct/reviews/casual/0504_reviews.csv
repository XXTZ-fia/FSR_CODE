Let's start with the positives: these pants are incredibly comfortable. The fabric is soft, stretchy, and cozy, making it perfect for lounging or a more casual workday. They’re super breathable, too, which is great for long wear.  However, there are a couple of things to note. First, the pants are quite long, so they tend to drag on the ground if you're on the shorter side (I'm 5'4"", and I have to be careful not to trip!). If you don't mind a bit of extra length, this might not bother you, but it takes adjusting if you're not used to it.  Another thing to consider is the high waist. It feels a little unusual initially if you’re not used to that fit. The waistband sits quite high on the natural waist, which is great for support, but it took me a little while to get comfortable. It’s not uncomfortable, just different from typical low-rise or mid-rise options. Once I got used to it, though, I appreciated the added support!  Overall, these are a great pair of pants if you’re looking for something comfy and versatile. Just be aware of the length if you're shorter, and give yourself a little time to get used to the high waist!",7

In any case, a small or even a medium would've been way better. Though I'm not sure if I would have liked them still. They are very fitted in the waist and crotch, and then loose in the leg. I think I thought they would be a softer, thicker material based on their use of the term ""sweatpants"" which these definitely are not. They are a taught yoga pant fabric. The seams are not flattering, the waistband seam is uncomfortable, as is the front seam which gave me CT, and then the whole front made me look like I had an enormous ""pooch,"" so there doesn't seem to be any tummy control for what they are. Just overall weirdly fitting, which is too bad because they are nicely made and they do look nice. I just don't think the cut is right for the fabric they chose, and I really don't know who was in charge of that painful waistband. I'm happy others love these, I just definitely did not and found them to be wholly unflattering. Great length in the pants, though.",2

I like the wide legs which contribute to the looseness and flattering look of these pants. I will probably wear them mostly as lounge pants since they are so comfortable, but they look nice enough to wear in many other settings.

The front vertical seam is a little more pronounced than I like. I don't enjoy the feel or look of it. I favor yoga pants with no front seam or a very subtle one.

When the pants are low enough that the front seam doesn't pull, the elastic waistband pinches since it's not sitting at my waist, and when the pants are pulled high enough that the waistband sits at my waist, the front seam pulls up and gives me camel toe, which is pretty uncomfortable.
