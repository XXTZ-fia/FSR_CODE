Taniel Solberg,It’s okay but I won’t buy it again,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REH9R5IR28BNN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4B79XR4,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 31, 2025",Color: WhiteSize: Large,Verified Purchase,Overall the shirt was nice but I won’t be buying it again. I am 5’2 and 195lbs. I was hoping the fit would have been a little more loose based on photos but it’s definitely form fitting which I’m not a big fan of because I’m a more curvy girl who is self conscious of my belly. My biggest issue though is that it’s very see through. I bought this shirt in white and even with a white bra underneath you can clearly see right through to my bra and make out everything underneath. If I wanted to wear it out I’d have to wear a tank top underneath to make sure nothing was showing.,

Fits to the size chart listed.  The ribbing adds to the nice look of it for sure.  The length is perfect for me and I'm 6' tall so it goes down to the top of my hip.  If you want to cover more of your butt and are tall this top would not meet your needs. The thickness is perfect (on the lighter side) in that it wears well under flannel tops.  The sleeve length is the perfect length...not too short and not too long.  The neck curve is not too high or too low so necklaces look nice resting against.  Highly recommend.  I will be buying several more colors.,

I haven’t tried to tuck them in (really not my style) so I can’t speak to that. One review said a horizontal wrinkle/line appeared (under the bust) if they slouched and I found the same thing happened to me. Maybe multiple washings will lessen that issue (I’m washing in cold water and laying flat to dry). It encourages me to stand up straight. 😃 I live in hot, humid South Florida and these tops are quite thick. But I guess I’d call them a medium weight as I have knit tops that are both lighter and heavier than these. Overall, I like them and would buy more.",
