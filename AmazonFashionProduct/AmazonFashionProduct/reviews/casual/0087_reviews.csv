It is tunic length, and although the material is thin and lightweight, it is super soft, and it is not see-through in this blue color. The shirt is a denim blue color, and the full-length pin tucks on the front of the shirt are interesting. The sleeves are breezy and cute, and even though I rarely like long-sleeved shirts because I tend to push the sleeves up anyway, I don't mind these sleeves. I also don't mind the gathers at the wrists. They are not too tight, even when I push the sleeves up. I normally wear a size L or XL in shirts, and in this one I went with XL after looking at the measurement chart, but I possibly could have gone with an L. I don't know how clingy it would have been if I had. For reference, I am 5'2"" tall with a short torso, leaning toward apple body type, with about a 42"" chest circumference at this time. I wish they would make a shirt similar to this with 3/4 sleeves just past the elbow and maybe slightly thicker material on the body of the shirt, or one that's not see-through in the lighter colors. The material is extremely soft though, and the shirt overall is very nice.",4

I wasn’t sure about the look of the  sleeves with all  the elastic around the wrist but I ended up really liking it.  I think it makes the sleeves more flattering and also gives a bit of a dressier look to the top making it a good choice for office wear.",

But it fits me weird.  So, I washed it, and used 3 fabric softener sheets. Can it still have static cling? I  don't think so. I don't know if it the rather thin soft fabric , or the way  it fits me in particular.  I mostly wear large, and extra large. But I got the 2x, because I have fat arms, and I wanted to wear a cami underneath, yet still have it be loose and flowy. It is not loose at all.It fits well for my fat arms. But it clings, and has ripples across my stomach area. If you normally wear a large, you might want to size up.",6

This top will be a staple favorite in my fall wardrobe. The pleated design adds a touch of elegance, making it perfect for both business casual and more dressed-up occasions.  The crew neck is flattering and comfortable, and the long sleeves provide just the right amount of warmth for cooler days. The fabric is soft and has a nice drape, which gives it a sophisticated look while remaining easy to care for. I love that it can be dressed up with a skirt or worn casually with jeans or pants.  I also appreciate the fit—it’s true to size and doesn’t cling, giving a relaxed yet polished appearance. The color options are great. I am 5'0"" and 117 pounds and the small fit perfectly!  Overall, this blouse is a fantastic addition to any wardrobe. It combines comfort, style, and versatility effortlessly. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a chic and practical fall top!",2

I have learned that I fit well into their size small for tops. I am 5'1"", 115 pounds, B cup. Size small fits my arm length well and fits my chest/belly area. I really like the pattern on this shirt with the lines that add texture. This top has sleeves with elastic to stay around the wrist. It's loose enough for me to comfortably wear my smart watch underneath, which is nice!  Automet is great about pricing and quality. The shirts hold up, I've never had issues with holes or wear and tear. This is the third shirt I've gotten from them and I love it. It's great for day to day errands or for work as it can be both casual or dressed up easily!  I line dry these tops I do not put them in the dryer. Material is very soft even without fabric softener. I have no complaints, I look forward to getting more shirts by this company!",7
