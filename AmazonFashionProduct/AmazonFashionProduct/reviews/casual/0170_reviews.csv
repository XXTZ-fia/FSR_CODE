I chose the white color though so I can't say anything about the darker colors.The fabric of this shirt is decent.  It feels slightly thicker than the really cheap shirts out there and it's also stretchy and soft enough for my sensitive skin.  It's not scratchy or stiff.  This will be great as a base for layering in the cooler months.I like the thumb holes at the sleeve ends.  I always like thumb holes for somewhat protecting my hands from germy surfaces and/or somewhat protecting from the sun.  Plus, I just like the look.I chose the XL size for my 38C chest and my 34"" waist, even though their size chart has XL at a 37.1"" chest and the waist at 32.48"".  I'm happy to report that the XL fits me nicely though if it shrinks in the wash, then it might be a little too snug.  But right now, it's almost perfect.  It doesn't hug my gut too much, the sleeves aren't too loose or tight and there's enough room for my chest, though it does get slightly snug across there when I spread my arms but it's not enough to be uncomfortable at all.  The inside tag in the shirt has conflicting info.  It says 'tumble dry low' but it also has the 'do not tumble dry' laundry symbol at the bottom of the tag so . . . that's irritating.  The shirt does have 31% cotton in it so it's probably best to not tumble dry it.I like the hem length.  This shirt isn't a hideous crop top but it's not too long, either.  I'm 5'5"" though so the shirt will be shorter on longer torsos or taller peeps, and longer on the peeps shorter than I.Overall, it's a nice shirt and I like it except for the see-through factor.
