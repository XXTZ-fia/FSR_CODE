You can dress it up or down with just a few accessories.The bad:  I understand products are purchased and returned frequently.  I bought what should've been new, but there were no tags on the piece.  A random receipt discovered in the pocket was unexpected, but not surprising.  What WAS surprising was after I'd put it on and wore it for about 10 minutes, I noticed it had clearly been worn by someone else for a period of time. I know this because of the stench of the fabric in the crotch area.  Ugh. It was horribly gross.  I'm going to have to wash the thing before I can wear it!  🤨",
