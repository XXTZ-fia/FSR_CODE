Jeremy Lutat,Good casual shirt; will probably not wear with sleeves rolled up,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QGJZQZ6ADNH7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXJPDD7,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 30, 2024",Color: Dark GreySize: Medium,,"I'm 5'6 with a 33"" waist and got a medium. This fits me pretty well. It's maybe just barely longer than what I'd like for an ""untucked"" shirt, but considering this isn't a ""short"" fit, this fits me well (meaning on a really tall person, this may be too short.)  The fabric is a twill and is a little on the heavier side compared to my regular dress shirts, so I'll probably save this for fall as a layering item, more like a shirt jacket. One factor that plays into this is that the back side of the fabric is a different color than the front (on the dark gray color at least). It doesn't show in a picture, so it's not worth trying to share an image of, but the inside is a slightly lighter, different tone of gray for some reason. It bothers me enough that I would probably not wear with the sleeves rolled up, which is how I almost always wear button-down shirts regularly.  The wash instructions also say not to tumble dry, which seems a little high maintenance, but the synthetic fabric should dry quickly. I'm usually prone to throwing treating everything the same and not even separating colors, so hopefully I'll remember not to throw this in the dryer.  Aside from that, the textured solid fabric is something different from anything else I have, and the nice gray color will coordinate easily with pretty much anything in my wardrobe.",6

Results are awesome.  I wear untucked as a heavy shirt or light jacket. It is thick so tucking is not comfortable for me plus it just looks better untucked IMO.

The sizing is predictable - I normally wear a large, and this fits as expected.  Being made of rayon and polyester, it will not shrink. It resists wrinkles, but don't leave it crumpled anywhere for too long or you will see signs of wrinkling, albeit faint compared to a cotton shirt.",
Nizel A.,A decent cold weather shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UVNBEQVMBA30/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXJPDD7,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 25, 2024",Color: Sky BlueSize: XX-Large,,"I'm not really a fan of what I deem ""sponge"" attire which is thick, squishy shirts that act similar to sponges. The look isn't very fashionable, but they are cheap so it's easy to build a wardrobe. With the thicker material it isn't really suited for warmer weather like the Summer. For Fall and Winter it is perfect attire for business casual or general activities.",
R.B.,Another Nice Coofandy Shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LX3KBIY22EU3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXJPDD7,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 25, 2024",Color: Blue PurpleSize: X-Large,,"This blue Coofandy long sleeve shirt is a near identical shirt to the last one (white) I ordered (see picture).  The only difference is the material.  This particular long sleeve has a slightly coarser material (95% Rayon, 5% Poly) making it a bit less soft than my other shirt (97% Poly 3% Spandex).  It also results in a slightly different looking texture.  It feels a touch lighter, but I’d still consider it a cool weather shirt.  I like both of my Coofandy shirts.  I ordered ‘blue-purple’ which might be better described as a medium-dark blue (not quite navy).",

The material is thicker than I expected, but feels very soft and comfortable. It will be a great shirt for when the temps drop in the fall. It is tapered to the waist and has a nice fitted look. I would recommend to a friend for sure.",
Joe Stevens,"Want Style, Quality and Durability?",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VHK8RDV1KN9V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXJPDD7,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 24, 2024",Color: Dark GreySize: Large,,"I’ll be blunt: if you really take care of this shirt you will be warm and happy for many years to come. This 100% polyester shirt is thick and comfortable. The seams are impeccable. There are additional and separate support panels for the front buttons and for the back of the shirt yoke. At this price point who does that kind of tailoring any more? I got mine in a dark gray herringbone pattern, but there are 9 other colors to choose from. I got it in Large as I particularly wanted to use it as a cool weather overshirt.  Sizing may be an issue. The online sizing chart indicates that the Small size is for people with a 40” waist, so it looks like the shirt is designed for the Big & Tall. You’ll just have to make a careful choice. The seller says the shirt can be worn tucked in, but it’s as thick as blanket, so that may be a little difficult. The only drawback I found with this thing is that you can’t tumble dry it after a wash.  How they put this much quality in a shirt costing less than $30 is beyond me, but I’m certainly glad they made that effort. Like I said, this is a shirt you’ll have for many years to come. It’s classically styled and will look great at either an autumn tailgate party or in the office. You can forget “fast fashion;” durability is a better selling point. Highly recommended.",

DBM,"Fits Great! SOFT!!! A little thick, but for the colder weather it is perfect!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R283VLFQWTOVE0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXJPDD7,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 23, 2024",Color: BlackSize: XX-Large,,"I wear a size 52 or 54 jacket. This fits me very well (XXL). I need the large size to accommodate my shoulders, but do not need what many shirts add in the midsection area (my waist is a size 40). This shirt is a little more compatible with me since It does not provide such an abundance of fabric in the midsection that needs to be tugged to my back and then tucked in. The shirt is so soft - I wish all of my shirts were this soft. The drape of the fabric is nice and the color is just as described. the texture is not overly coarse either. The buttons are a proper size so as not to bring attention to them.The shirt fits me very well. I could wear it tucked in or not.",
Phuong Nguyen,More of a fall than summer shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1F8N5ENENF92U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXJPDD7,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 22, 2024",Color: KhakiSize: Medium,,This is thick and heavy shirt probably well suited for the cool weather than summer heat. It claims that it is wrinkled free so I took it off from the air sealed bag and hung it to see if the wrinkles are going away. The stitches are nice and Coofandy craftsmanship is great as always so this is a good shirt to buy,
