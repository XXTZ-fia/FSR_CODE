I would not describe it as oversized, it seems to fit me as expected for a size small.  Its very soft and stretchy and has a lot of nice detailing in the stitching of the fabric.  The arms are open weave, so depending on the temperature you might opt for a shirt underneath.",8

This sweater is not only soft but it is warm and cozy. The netting pattern in the sleeves sets this sweater apart. I love the color too. It is very nice and well designed.  Great find to wear in the fall and winter. The fabric is delicate and I suggest taking care of this sweater so that little pills don’t start to form.  Glad I have this sweater. It gets two thumbs up!,

Like the open weave crochet on the sleeves, some may not but you could easily wear an undershirt for colder temps if you are concerned. I think sometimes sweaters are TOO warm in the in between seasons (ie a warm fall day too warm for sweaters but the colors are fall and you want the full vibe). This is a great sweater. I love the cut and how it frames. It's a winner.",

This is an overall wonderful top that I am so happy to incorporate into my Autumn and Winter clothing!",

I thought that the displayed photo was pretty, but even the photo does not capture the beauty of this sweater. It's soft too; made of a very skin friendly vicose/polyester blend. This sweater is a crew neck pull on, and has vertical lines on the neck and upper portion of the sweater. The sleeve cuffs and hem are both ribbed, and a nice length (and I have long arms!) These long sleeves are sort of a ""waffle"" knit with small hollowed out sections that really add interest and elegance to the knit style. The sweater is also a great length; about 2-3 inches below my hips.  The deep cocoa brown color is also beautiful; a perfect color for the upcoming fall and winter seasons. The label indicates that this sweater can be machine washed- If doing so, I would suggest using a gentle cycle and a laundry bag to preserve the distinctive beauty of this sweater.  What a great value for a sweater that is premium quality and is expensive looking and feeling. This sweater pairs beautifully with jeans, dress slacks and skirts- It is a gorgeous and much cherished addition to my wardrobe!",
