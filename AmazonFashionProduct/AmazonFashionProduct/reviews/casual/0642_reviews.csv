This dress hits all of those (plus, it's also affordable!). I live in Tampa, FL, where it's hot and humid most of the year, so I love how the fabric is lightweight but not too thin. I like how the dress gives you a waistline without clinging to the belly area. I like the slightly longer sleeves (keeps me from getting too cold if I step into the A/C for a while!). I also really like that the wrap neckline is sexy but isn't too deep, making the dress appropriate for family settings.  The only two possible gripes I have with this dress is that it falls a bit shorter on me than I personally prefer (about 3"" above my knees), which makes it so I have to be mindful if it's windy. The second gripe is that the fabric and stitching feel a little bit cheap. But you get what you pay for!  Overall, I am very happy with this dress, and I'm thinking about purchasing another! For reference, I bought a size large, I'm 5'8'', my weight is 170 lbs., and my bust/waist/hip measurements are 38"", 33"", and 43"", respectively.",6

It was the last one I tried on. By then I was over it... Until I looked in the mirror. This dress cinches the mid-section so well and has enough fabric on the bottom to flare out just right. It is flattering to the top. I received so many compliments. The only caveat is the button used at the top it pulls and causes that weird ""pulling button peep hole"" thing that happens on shirts. I just unbuttoned it and it looked great. I'm 5'9"" and wear a size L/ XL. I ordered the XL because I am top heavy 38DDD/F and usually the v cut is too deep or not enough coverage on smaller sizes and this fit great.
