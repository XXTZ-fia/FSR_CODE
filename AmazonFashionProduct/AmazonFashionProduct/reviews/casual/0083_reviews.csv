There we a couple of loose threads but nothing that unraveled the sweater and the weaving was nice enough to not let a breeze through while not being so heavy as to be unwearable in fall.  The zipper is really nicely constructed. I was expecting with as soft as the sweater was that the zipper would give me trouble but it actually didnt and was really easy to zip or unzip. I have a super long torso so I have to wear this with an undershirt or something tucked into jeans but other than that I really really like this sweater!,

It is made of polyester, one of the most popular and cheapest type of materials on the market, and polyamide. Both are synthetic. It has a knit pattern and ribbed texture, making it feel thicker. The design is simple but elegant and relaxed.  I never pay much attention to my attire. During the 29+ years doing electrical engineering work, I wore a suit for the first three or four days, and never wore a suit again until I retired. A few years after that, following the advice of my boss, I did wear a tie just long enough to present something really important to the customers. One time, while shooting the breeze with a friend in the hallway, another friend walked by and with a friendly voice, he exclaimed, “there is no difference between you and the janitors!” I was wearing an old collarless T-shirt and a worn-out pair of jeans. I did not offend or bother me whatsoever, so I just laughed it off. Another time, during lunch time, while standing in front of my cubicle, a co-worker passed by and with a friendly voice, he pointed to my grey T-shirt and said “this is the ugliest shirt I have ever seen!” I did not offend or bother me at all, so I just laughed it off. A female co-worker came out of her cubicle and repeatedly demanded him to apologize. Another time, the senior manager came to a meeting. He greeted several people sitting on my left while looking them in the eyes. When he got to me, he said hello while staring at my chest. I wondered what caught his eyes, so I looked down and saw two peppercorn-sized holes and a coffee stain on my T-shirt. I never used that T-shirt anymore after that day.  To make a long story short, I am no fashion expert. I never pay much attention to clothing. All I know is this sweater looks nice. It is comfortable to wear and looks darn good on me, so it gets a 5-star rating.",

I worry about the material holding up in the wash over time, and it does say not to put it in the dryer. I marked it down because I don’t consider the color dark green. It’s more of a blue/green or dark teal, so I’m disappointed in the color. The zipper is a great quality, and very sturdy and looks nice in the sweater.",6
