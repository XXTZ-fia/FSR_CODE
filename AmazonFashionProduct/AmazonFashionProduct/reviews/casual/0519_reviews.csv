I was looking for a spring/fall coat that wasn’t too warm or too heavy but warm enough for a cool day/evening.

Looks stylish but can also look simple. And bonus, I was able to wrap around my waist in case didn’t want to wear it or carry it! I hesitated to get it since I  tried and returned many others styles. But this one is a keeper!Observation: it fit nicely over thin layers but if you plan to wear it over thick sweaters, you may want to size up.  I also wish the sash/belt were a bit longer (but I guess is would look funny when untied…)",18

I do wish the length of the belt was a bit longer. - there are hidden pockets on both sides.  I ordered the white in a size L, according to the size chart and my usual size. It fits well. While I think it’s cute and I will get a good amount of wear out of it, I do think this would look even better on someone longer in the body. I am short waisted and where the belt hits me isn’t as flattering as I would like.",22

The pull-tie belt is very flattering. When the coat is open, it can look a little awkward since it isn't a real belt. Also, it has snaps all down the front. Again, when it's closed, it looks fine, like a normal coat. But when it's open, it looks a little cheap. If you just need a casual, styled coat, this is a good option. It is lightweight to hold but still keeps you pretty warm. However, I think it looks fancier in the pictures than it does in real life. It is also form-fitting/fitted, so size up if you want a looser fit.",9
TrurevieW,Simple Casual Jacket,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22HDQYHRRRXB1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6R4Z7WL,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 20, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Small,,"I recently wore this jacket and overall, I'm quite pleased with it. The design is sleek and versatile, featuring a stand collar, a button-down front, and a slim fit that gives it a modern touch. The mid-length overcoat style adds a touch of sophistication, while the wrap tie waist allows for adjustable fitting—whether you want to cinch it at the waist or wear it open.  The jacket is well-made with a solid color that complements a variety of outfits. The long sleeves and pockets are practical and add to its overall functionality. I opted for the black color in a size small. It has a bit of weight to it, which contributes to its warmth, but it's not overly heavy or cumbersome.  One of my favorite features is the hidden snaps, which provide a clean look when the jacket is fastened. However, it's worth noting that the black fabric does attract lint more easily than lighter colors.  Despite this minor inconvenience, the jacket keeps me warm and pairs well with almost anything in my wardrobe. I’d rate it a solid 4 out of 5 stars for its stylish design and practicality, with the lint attraction being the only drawback.",20

I love the snaps instead of buttons or zipper. This is a winner!,6
