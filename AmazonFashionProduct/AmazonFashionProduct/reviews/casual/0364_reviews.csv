The silky material feels luxurious on the skin, draping smoothly and giving it a slight dressy vibe. It’s perfect for both casual and semi-formal settings. My only minor quibble is with the cuffs & collar—while they add a bit of character, they do give the shirt a more relaxed feel, which contrasts with the otherwise polished look. But honestly, that's a small thing in the grand scheme of how great this shirt feels and looks. The navy blue royal color is rich. I’d love to order it in another color for variety.

The fabric falls solidly within the “blouse” category.  I would not consider it a t-shirt.  It’s a pullover blouse.I am 5’6”, 185 pounds, 38DDD, size large (12/14) in tops.  When selecting a size, I always reference the bust measurement on the sizing chart.  In this case, the manufacturer’s sizing chart seems to indicate that I should order my usual size of large, so I did.  The large, on me, is too fitted through the chest, waist and hips.  The fabric does have some stretch to it, so it didn’t feel tight or constricted.  But it wasn’t a great look, especially with the ribbed design being stretched every which way over my chest.The fabric is polyester/elastane.  It is machine washable on cold, hang to dry.  On a positive note, it comes out of the washer in perfect condition.  On a negative note, I thought the fabric was a bit scratchy.  Another downside, you could see my neutral bra through the white fabric.  And considering how sheer it is, I thought it was warm to wear, not cool and breathable.  It definitely feels like a man-made material.  I selected the white color, but it is more of an ivory or cream than a bright white.Personally, I didn’t like this as a t-shirt with jeans.  I could see this as an option to wear under a blazer.  But the textured design of the fabric will make it bulky underneath.I’m only giving this shirt 3 stars because of the small fit, and the coarse, non-breathable, see-thru fabric.",13
