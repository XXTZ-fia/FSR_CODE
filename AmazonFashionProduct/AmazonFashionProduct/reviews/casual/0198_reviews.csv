I had planned to wear them to holiday events but they are not really dressy enough to wear with dress pants or a skirt. In my opinion they would look better with jeans or maybe more casual pants. They are a very light material so depending upon the color you will need a camisole underneath. I do like the sleeve detail and the metal modesty bar as it gives a little pizzaz to an otherwise basic tee. I am keeping these for more casual wear.,6
