I tried it on and the fit was perfect - haven't worn it out yet, but it seems well made.  I hung it on a hanger and sprayed with ""wrinkle releaser"" (Downey, but any brand OK) to get the packing wrinkles out.  I got a size larger because I don't like tight sweaters.  I hangs down just right - not too big or too small.  Raglan sleeves are my favorite when mail ordering because with their lack of shoulder seams it's much easier to fit what ever ""size"" your shoulders are, and if you want tight or loose.  (For reference, got XL. I'm 5'10""; 145 lbs.)  It hangs down just past my butt.  The sleeves are 2"" longer than my wrist, but easy to fold up or just push up.  Color is ""Autumn Grey"" and the picture showed almost black, but I was hoping it was dark gray - and it is.  It is scary ordering clothes after reading the reviews, but I lucked out this time.
