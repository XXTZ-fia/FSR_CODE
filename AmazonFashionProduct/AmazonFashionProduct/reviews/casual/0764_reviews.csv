According to that I should have ordered a half size smaller,  though as large as they I think I would have needed a full size smaller. I tried inserting heel grips to take up some room, but the shoes are also very wide, and the gapping on the sides make the heel grips less effective. They are otherwise really comfortable, and look well made for a faux suede, but the width makes them look more like house slippers, and that is mostly how I have been wearing them. The are pretty lightweight, and pack for travel pretty well. I've had no scuffing so far, and while it's artificial suede I still don't feel comfortable wearing them in the rain. I like the color options, and think they would have been really attractive in a narrower and more appropriate size.",

While this didn't cause major discomfort, it did make the shoes feel less secure, especially when walking briskly.  Another issue was the soles – they were quite slick, causing her to slip a bit on our hardwood floors. The product info mentions a TPR outsole, which has lower flex and slip resistance than rubber soles. This might only be an issue on slick surfaces, though.  Despite these issues, my wife likes the shoes. They seem to be of good quality and finish. Overall, I'd give them a 3.7/5.",

They're so comfortable. My son has been wearing this brand tennis shoes for the last few years and loves them and now I see why! I really feel like I'm wearing slippers when I have these one and they have a surprising amount of support for flats. I work on my feet nearly all day but I need to look cute and professional, these have been my go to since I got them. They're holding up great thus far, I think the quality is really nice especially for the price. My son's last few pairs have lasted him until he outgrew them so I expect to get quite a long life out of these guys. My only tiny complaint is the sizing. I'm normally a 7.5 or an 8, but a lot of times with flats or heels a 7.5 ends up pinching my toes. I decided to get an 8 for that reason but these are roomy! I guess it's not really an issue as I am still able to wear them, but I have kind of stepped out of them a few times and I do wish that I had gotten a 7.5. So I would say just keep in mind that these shoes are made with your toes in mind and really run true to size while picking out which size to order. Overall I'm super happy with these! They're not the biggest statement but they're a solid comfy classic that will go with just about any outfit!",5

Trying to get a view of the shoe from every angle....even stepping on tiptoe but leaving no visible marking or creases on the top of the shoe. Since the shoes are suede it's not something that I would wear in the summer or even the spring but ideally more toward fall and winter, definitely a jeans or skirt type of compatible flat shoe. This style of loafer can go dressy or casual comfortably. There is a slight bit of ""skid proofing"" on the bottom front of each loafer flat to help when walking on wet surfaces.",7

The soles are a soft rubber that helps contribute to walking comfort. I have nothing but praise for these slip-ons. Do note that they seem to run a tad large; I consistently wear a women's size 11 and ordered these accordingly; they fit a little loose. They aren't so loose that it will prevent me from wearing them, but enough that they feel large. I think a 10.5 would fit perfectly, but since there are no half sizes, I would have to go with the 11 anyway. I love these shoes for the comfort and beauty of them (I got several compliments and comments of ""oooo, look at your shoes!"") so it's easy to give them 5 stars  and recommend them with confidence - just be sure to know your sizing.",4
