The shirt is sized just right. It is thin, but not too thin or see through. It is soft and feels really nice on. I like the cap sleeve, and the ruched sides make it pleasingly form fitting. When spring comes I think I would like a few more of these shirts.",

Trevor & Amber,True to Size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RS610U77VG2X2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHS3WRVM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Color: Cadet BlueSize: X-Large,,I ordered the cadet blue which is a soft teal. Very pretty color. This top fits true to size but is not a loose fit but more body skimming. The length hits at my hip which is perfect. The ruching adds some style to this top and helps to conceal and draw attention away from problem areas. The material is soft and silky and feels of good quality. It has a bit of stretch allowing the shirt to move with you. The cap sleeves provide some arm concealment for those who do not like full arm exposure. It washed and dried well in my home washer and dryer. Great price for a summer basic.,
Putting The Pieces Together,All Coral is All Beautiful,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UYLR76K6LZRR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHS3WRVM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Color: All CoralSize: Small,,"Material is 60% Polyester, 35% Rayon, 5% Spandex and feels like soft cotton. The coral is beautiful. Images are of a size Small. Daughter is now anxiously awaiting warm temperatures. The secure ruching and cut of a round hem make this a perfect design. Launder in a garment bag, tumble dry on low for a few minutes, then hang to complete drying with great results. The cost of $15 USD makes this a value purchase.",2
SG,"Comfortable, basic tee shirt at a fantastic price",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22729VEUZLG35/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHS3WRVM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Color: All BlackSize: Large,,"This tee shirt is surprisingly soft and comfortable, made of a 60% polyester, 35% rayon, 5% spandex blend. I always look for cap sleeves because I find them to be most comfortable and flattering, and this did not disappoint. What sets this basic tee apart from others is the ruching on the sides. This gives it a bit of a draped look which can be helpful to hide any tummy or waist issues. This shirt fits true to size in my opinion. It is not too fitted or cropped, so it could be worn out or tucked in to a skirt or pants. It is basic enough that it can be dressed up or down for virtually any occasion, either on its own or under a blazer. It's easy care-just toss it in the machine and line dry. Mine arrived wrinkled due to vacuum packing and a few minutes in the dryer had it ready to wear.",5

The color is a bright, royal blue as shown. I typically wear an 18/20 due to bust size, and the XXL fits well. It's a bit big in the back but the front is fitted. It survived the first wash without any issues or color loss. It's a well-made top that's worth the price.",
Jim W.,Very comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10E45LCFMJBPK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHS3WRVM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Color: All BlackSize: Medium,,This black shirt with ruching on the sides is very comfortable.

Jamie Reynolds,Runs maybe *slightly* small?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Y12HMXQ86LQ9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHS3WRVM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: All CoralSize: XX-Large,,"I’m not entirely sure if it fits as expected or not, the ruching makes it a bit hard to judge. I ordered my normal size and it’s a bit tight, but the only clothing I’ve ever owned with ruching are my pre-kids bodycon dresses. So in my experience, ruching is meant to be tight.  It’s still a comfy shirt though—very soft and it’s got good stretch. The sleeves aren’t as nonexistent as they appear to be before putting it on, they are definitely short short so if you have upper arm insecurities, I’d pass on this shirt.  The color is really pretty and summery. It’s actually slightly lighter than it appeared on my screen (which is weird, stuff usually ends up being darker for me), it’s almost pastely in real life.  Overall I maybe wish it fit slightly looser, but I still think it’ll be a nice vacation (which is why I ordered it) and summer shirt.",2

The shirt fits me a little  tight so I would order the next size up because now the sleeves seem too short and you can’t really notice the side detailing.

BKK Reviewer,Nice T for the price!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1517GEOLEA1KD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHS3WRVM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Color: Cadet BlueSize: Small,,"This is a surprisingly nice T for the price. The ruching detail along the two lower side seams gives it an extra touch that most Ts don't have, and that with the shorter sleeves create a slimming silhouette. My significant other loves it and particularly likes the fabric, which is a soft, comfy mix of polyester, rayon and spandex. The added details of this T mean you could dress it up or down, depending on the occasion.",
