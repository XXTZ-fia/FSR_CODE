I wear a 40 or 42 size waist and 32 inch inseam. I bought the XXXL size. They fit absolutely perfectly! They fit exactly how I was hoping they would. Only thing is as far as I can tell there isn’t much or any “spandex” material in these, so I wouldn’t reccomend running in them, you may tear them. Four pockets - two in the front two in the rear. A lot of other “jogger” brands only have one rear pocket and I personally appreciate the fact that they give you that extra pocket. When it comes to the color, it doesn’t wash out in the washing machine nor stain any other articles of clothing. They’re very breathable; if you’re buying these to keep you warm in the fall/winter, you may want some longjohns underneath. Material quality I would rate a 70. I’m wearing these to casual events and not to work in the garage if you catch my drift. When it comes to rip resistance, honestly they’re going to tear - hence the reason I said I would wear them for “knockin’ around” or to casual events; definitely not so much a work pant. I have bought so far three different pairs each with a different color, and they all look and fit great. I recommend these for a nice casual pair of tapered style jogger pants, but wouldn’t advise running or jogging in them.",6

In jeans I'll normally wear about 33/34x30 size. The first pair of these I bought were black and in XL, wasn't sure how much they'd shrink. The XL fits nice if I wanted a more baggy look. I bought a 2nd pair in black and got a large. These fit nice even after a couple washes, more of the fit I was wanting. So I got a 3rd pair in the dark purple red color and a 4th pair in the soft khaki. Super comfy and they look good. I was debating on maybe trying a medium for a more fitted/skinny pant look but I don't think they'd be too comfortable for me, so I'm sticking with the large size and probably get some more colors especially when they're on sale!",3
