The buttons on the front are small and sorta hard to button up, but he usually wears it with the bottom two fastened and the top button undone, I think snaps would have been easier, but I haven't seen as many snap fastenings the last few years, maybe they have fallen out of favor.  I washed this on warm with a load of like colored shirts and pants, then dried it on warm for 45 minutes, it came out even softer and wrinkle/crease free.  Some more thoughts; the shoulders fit well.

Quite frankly, I could buy this if I wanted it, and I am doing these reviews for fun. I am a 65 year old guy and have appreciated the very clear and detailed reviews on Amazon. I started leaving my own and was selected to give these for products that I wanted to look into. But I will call a dog a dog.  *************** Explanation of Rating System *************************  My rating system.  1 star - terrible. I wouldn't consider buying it.  2 stars - marginal at best. Doesn't meet the minimum requirements or quality to be useful. Buy it at your own risk.  3 stars - average. Meets the quality and requirements for a product of this type but is nothing out of the ordinary. If the price is good, I'd probably buy it.  4 stars - better than average. Exceeds the typical quality of a product of this type and has a few extra features not usually found on other products of this type. I'd buy it.  5 stars - exceptional - far exceeds the quality of products of this type. Hard to beat the quality and features included. Best value for the money. I wouldn't hesitate to buy it..",4

As I suspected I would and hoped that I wouldn’t, I’m less than thrilled with the aesthetic choice to make the stitching a design element—if it looked like it does in the product photos, I’d like it better, but it doesn’t. In my photo you can see the stitches are more far more widely spaced than advertised (the stitching at the top of the photo is where the arms are attached to the body).

The soft, lightweight fabric offers excellent stretch, making it super comfortable. The classic three-button design adds just the right style without feeling overdone. I love pairing it with jeans or layering it under a coat for a more polished look. It’s perfect for casual outings, and the fit is spot-on.",

He is 6’2” and has trouble finding shirts that are long enough for his torso, without having to size way up for that messy, slouchy shouldered look and this shirt is it! He is 195lbs, 6’2” and the XL fits great. Washed up nicely on cool-casual and tumble dry on low without shrinkage. The cotton feels smooth to the touch and elevates the style to look nice enough to wear out to dinner.",
