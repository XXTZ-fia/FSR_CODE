DoveSoup,I should have paid closer attention to the fabric content,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RICZSS4IV8BVT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8HSGYKW,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: OlivergreenSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"There is no cotton in this T-shirt. The lack of cotton makes it a little too slinky for my tastes. I feel like the T-shirt fits a little bit too tight and without any cotton, it just clings to and exploits every little imperfection. I never wear bra and this T-shirt makes it all too obvious. It’s nearly 100% rayon with a small amount of spandex, which requires delicate wash cycle and lay flat drying. (IMO, equals wrinkles) I purchased the olive green color, it’s OK, but a little bit more like a drab military khaki green than olive green. I like the top well enough, I considered sending it back for a large (medium being my true size) but I think that the shoulders would be too wide in a large. Unfortunately, this one just is going back, it’s too bad. I really did like the style.",
