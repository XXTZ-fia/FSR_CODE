I got the black. The material is nice and thick and good quality but it is very heavy and just too warm! My house was 68° and I had to take the suit off almost immediately. I got so hot! I have long arms and the sleeves are too long. I had a hard time closing and opening the zipper in the back, so my daughter had to help me. I decided to cut the suit into two pieces so that it’s easier to go to the bathroom. I didn’t even have to sew the edges. I also shortened the sleeves. I can wear the two pieces together or separately and not have to worry about the zipper every time I have to go to the bathroom. The top now pulls up, so I can either pin it down or just wear a belt or a sash over it to keep it down and cover any exposed skin. Runs true to size. I am a large to XL and a 16, 5’8 and 190 pounds. The XL fits great. Material is stretchy.",

I bought a medium, and I am 5’7 140lbs. However I am going to return it, the compression of the material is so tight on my arms and upper torso. It stretches but since it is such a thick material, I’m scared I would sweat in it. From the belly button up it’s seriously like a scuba suit. Also, it has a zipper on the back and it’s tight to pull and the compression from the material keeps me from reaching it. So I would always have to have someone help me when I went to the bathroom. Just not practical. Wish it would have worked but I’m literally scared I’ll be stuck in it. It was not too small, just weird material.",10
