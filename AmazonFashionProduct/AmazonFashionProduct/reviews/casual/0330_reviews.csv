I had hesitations about buying it because the manufacturer ""Coofandy"" can sometimes provides an odd fabric or odd design choices, so I'm never sure what I'm going to get despite the pictures. About half of what I order from them gets returned, but that's not a big problem because returns for their products are easy.  On the other hand, I""ve recently experimented with some other products they make and have been very pleased. This year I've been particularly happy with their linen shirts and pants.  Back to this shirt, they call it a Dress Shirt and it really is a very nice dress shirts that would look great with formal business attire. But it also looks great as a casual shirt too.  I will continue to try their products.",2
