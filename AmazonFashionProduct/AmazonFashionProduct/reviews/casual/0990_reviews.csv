The price was great, the shoes looked great, and they were comfortable. I used them for walking around the house, shopping, and walking outside, but no exercise or anything extreme at all. Unfortunately, you only get what you pay for with these shoes because they only last 3 months. I attached pictures showing the shoes falling apart.  This inside sole is coming loose causing slight discomfort on my foot. I could get past this because I can buy inserts and replace them. However, also the bottom of the shoes has lost its integrity completely, causing them not to be water-tight and allowing debris to get in. I understand these shoes were priced low, but they didn't even last a full three months without completely falling apart, and they do not perform their basic function anymore.",
