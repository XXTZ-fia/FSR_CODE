I ordered a medium. It's roomy and comfortable,  the bright pink color is pretty,  but it's misleading to call it a 'sweatshirt '. The material is thicker than a t-shirt, but it's definitely not sweatshirt material. I like the v- neck style of it. I definitely kept it and am happy with the color and fit but you should know it's not an actual sweatshirt.  It washed perfectly,  no shrinking or pilling of the material.  I would give it 5*, if they didn't call it a sweatshirt and make you think that's what you're getting.  Now that I know the type of material it is, I would definitely order more in different colors. If you want a nice, long sleeve v neck,  this is great. If you want an actual thick,  sweatshirt type shirt you'll be happy with the fit and feel of the material but know it's not a sweatshirt.",7
