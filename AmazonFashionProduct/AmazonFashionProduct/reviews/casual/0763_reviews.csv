I ordered a few in different patterns. Unfortunately the collars are a big problem. I like cotton shirts that can be washed, dried, and promptly hung up with minimal effort. These are listed as 100% cotton so I figured they would be no problem like other brands (including some from Amazon bran). Unfortunately the collars will not stay put - they tend to warp and curl out of shape which requires ironing to get them straight again. Leaving them warped is not an option if you want to look professional so be prepared to iron after every wash. Disappointing. As others have mentioned there is no way to insert collar stays either. I hope Amazon makes changes to this shirt design by adding collar stays and/or buttons to the collar. Overall nice shirt, but requires extra time and effort to keep them looking professional. Won't buy more until they change the design to help with the collar issues. Rare miss from Amazon Essentials.",
