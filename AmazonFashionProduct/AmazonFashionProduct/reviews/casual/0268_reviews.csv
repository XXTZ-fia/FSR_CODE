And this is something you can wear in any season. They can serve as a soft under garment to keep you warm, or under a blouse buttoned or open. When it's warm you can wear it on it's own. They are very reasonably priced, and you can wear them year round. I like them very much. (I haven't washed these yet, so I don't know how color-fast they are.)",

They angle up instead of coming straight across and end up much too high; I do not think I could wear this on its own for that reason, although it might be fine under a blazer or cardigan. If anyone from the company is reading this - please make clothes for a wider range of body types. Almost all Chinese-made clothes I buy on Amazon are not for curvy women.",3
