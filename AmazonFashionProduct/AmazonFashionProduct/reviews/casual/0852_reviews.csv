Right out of the package, I noticed how soft the fabric is, making it incredibly comfortable to wear for long hours. The material feels high-quality and holds up well after multiple washes without losing its shape or color.  The fit is another highlight. It has a loose, relaxed style that allows for easy movement while still looking put together. I appreciate that it's not overly baggy, so I can wear it casually or dress it up a bit with accessories. I ordered my usual size, and it fits perfectly, providing just the right amount of room without feeling frumpy.  One minor downside is that the shirt might be too warm for hot summer days, but it's perfect for layering in cooler weather or wearing on its own during spring and fall.  Overall, I highly recommend the AUTOMET Women's Long Sleeve Shirts for anyone looking for a blend of comfort and style. It’s a solid addition to my wardrobe and offers great value for the price.",4

The shirt is made out of a soft fabric that is lightweight, not see-through while you wear it, and is pretty good for layering. The color really is quite different and isn't quite brown or grey and yet it is both. All seams have been properly finished. The style is not at all fitted and is very relaxed to the point it somewhat resembles one of those tunics from an old movie. I will say that the sizing is on the generous side since I've been having to order XLs lately and this one I ordered in size L which is ever so slightly big on me. I've preferred to pair it with jeans, a long cardigan, a semi-chunky bead necklace, and it doesn't turn out too bad that way. Great for cool fall days as a matter of fact....",

I ordered up for a really loose baggy comfortable fit . Soft material , does not shrink , does not pill , nice quality , a good poly blend material . Sleeves are long enough  . If I wanted to wear it out in public with jeans I would have ordered a medium because I feel this shirt fits TTS. Color is spot on ! Not see thru ! Not thick , rather a t shirt material but so super soft . For $8 it was an excellent purchase and I love wearing it with my coffee colored lounging pants around the house ! I will probably need something a little warmer for winter but for Fall is absolutely perfect. For reference I’m 5’11” with long arms , thin body , I weigh 140 lbs and I have a very full , very large 36 D cup .  If you want it for lounging size up for comfort . If you want it to wear out in public with a  more fitted look , order your normal size . I really like it ! Great prime day deal !  I only took away one star because for me it’s a lounging top not a wear out in public shirt .",10
