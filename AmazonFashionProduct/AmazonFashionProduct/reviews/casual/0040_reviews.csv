It is rare to find casual pants that offer a 31-inch inseam, which is my size. Rear pockets are deep enough so they can be buttoned over a larger wallet which doesn't have to be placed sideways. Pants are stylish in that they are cut just below the natural waist; however, this makes them a little tight in the crotch. Negatives. Front pockets are a bit shallow; closure button and rear pocket buttons are sewn on very loosely and will likely come off soon and have to be resewn on.",
