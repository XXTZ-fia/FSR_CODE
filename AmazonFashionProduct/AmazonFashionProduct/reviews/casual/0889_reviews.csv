That fabric is 100% Polyester. Polyester is notoriously horible at wicking and breathability. If you google ""Is Polyester a good hot wether fabric?"" The answer is: ""Polyester is generally not recommended for hot weather because it's a synthetic fabric that doesn't breathe well and can trap heat and moisture against the skin. This can make you feel uncomfortable, sticky, and hot. Polyester can also retain odors and bacteria."" This is the second item ive recived from COOFANDY that I will be returning. The other was a pair of ""Linen"" pants that were 70% viscose(rayon) I will be avoiding all COOFANDY listing's in the future to avoid wasting more time shiping out returns.",8
