The Reflective Reader,Comfortable yet fashionable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TIWBBMTJU30Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJLKMBTQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 17, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I recently purchased a few Dokotoo Women's Blouses and Tops, including their Short Sleeve Chiffon Shirts and Tops, and I'm absolutely thrilled with my experience. The quality of the chiffon fabric is exceptional. It's lightweight, breathable, and drapes beautifully, perfect for warm weather or layering under a blazer for a more polished look. I love how the fabric doesn't wrinkle easily, which is a huge plus for busy days when I need to look put together without a lot of fuss. Fit-wise, the sizing is accurate, and the tops are tailored in a flattering way without being too tight or restrictive. The short sleeves are just the right length, and the overall cut is feminine without being overly girly.  Overall, I highly recommend this top for anyone looking to add versatile, stylish pieces to their wardrobe. Whether dressing for work, a casual outing, or a special occasion, this line has something that will make you look and feel fabulous.",14
David Houck,🌸 Stylish & Comfy – Dokotoo Women's Chiffon Blouses & Tops! 👚,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SJCPB72UZELG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJLKMBTQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Size: LargeColor: 5 a Purple,Verified Purchase,"The Dokotoo Women's Chiffon Blouses and Tops are an absolute must-have for any wardrobe! 😍 These tops strike the perfect balance between style and comfort, making them perfect for both casual and semi-formal occasions. The lightweight chiffon fabric is breathable and soft, keeping you cool and comfortable all day long—whether you're at the office, out with friends, or running errands. 🏃‍♀️💨 The short sleeves add a relaxed, airy vibe, while the flowy fit provides a flattering silhouette that works with any body type. 🌿✨",2
Kim T,Nice dressy top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CDN6L5LVGZ41/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJLKMBTQ,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 22, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,I ordered the blue one and it was very pretty and a flattering fit. I will say the style may not compliment every body type so don't go by height/weight of others. If you have a wide waist you may find it snug. The length just about sits at the waist so you can't pull it down if you wanted more coverage for your lower half. On the flip side if you are on the small chested skinny side you may not like how it hangs because your body type alters the look of the style. It will wrinkle so wash on delicate with Woolite and always hang.,4
B,Beautiful cut and fit but fabric isn't the best quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AIQN9CZPU3YK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJLKMBTQ,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I love everything about this except I wish the fabric was a bit higher quality, I am 5'4"", 135 lbs and the M fits perfectly. The draped neckline is beautiful and very flattering. I've worn this with jeans and with nice wide leg pants and it goes well with both being able to be dressed up and down equally well. I only wish the fabric was a little higher quality. It's a bit hard to describe, but the crepe chiffon fabric that this is made of, is very inexpensive quality. It's the same kind of chiffon that tops at Walmart and other low-end stores would carry. On the one hand, the price of this top makes this understandable. On the other hand, I'd have happily paid a little more for a more tightly woven crepe chiffon. I ordered this in black, so the difference isn't as apparent as it probably would be in other colors. If ordering this in black, you can get away with it - - - especially if wearing it at night in dimmer lighting. When I wore this with jeans during the day, I was bothered by it more because the natural lighting really called attention to the cheaper fabric quality. When I wore this to dinner with my wide leg pants, it was barely noticeable - - - and probably by only me because I was aware of it. If you are ordering this in other colors and thinking of wearing it in a professional office setting workplace, I'd think twice.",3

The bottom hem is a tad snug over jeans . Will be buying more colors but in xl. Stitching looks good and should hold up.,5

I've also traveled with the blue one several times, and it comes out of the suitcase with minimal enough wrinkling that I don't have to iron it. Love that!",

Found this one and was intrigued, so I ordered it in three different colors. It is a gorgeous blouse - very well-made and nice fabric (not see through!)... the only reason it did not receive a perfect five stars is because the seaming in front of the shoulders is a bit odd. But, overall, the colors are gorgeous (the light blue and hot pink are STUNNERS!) and it wears beautifully. It does require a clothes steamer (which I purchased at Wally World for a mere $9.00). Once steamed, it stays wrinkle-free, even after wearing! Plan to order several more in other colors. Highly recommend. Wore with a pretty moto jacket unzipped and the collar laid perfectly at the jacket opening.",4

If it helps my measurements are: 5'2"" and 36 x D3 chest and this top fit well when I am fluctuating 140-150 lbs. I bought a Medium. I seldom find this sort of information on here and find it very useful so hopefully someone else will too! It hides whatever I want it to hide 🙈 and being a curvy person myself I'd say it works for curvy people. Its very flattering, not at all sheer, and machine washable (it did not shrink for me!)

I'm 5'7"" and currently at & below the 180 lb mark. I'm halfway to my goal😁 Not easy to do in your late 60s... OMAD😐 Hopefully the shirt will still look good down 25lbs or so from now. This shirt is such a beautiful color! There were, of course, 1 or 2 wrinkles when I took it out of the bag. A couple sprays of water and some light touch ups with the iron fixed that, though I didn't really have to. Maybe just spray with water and let the breeze blow it out. It seems that not many people own irons these days. It fits well. The bottom anchors to the hip area and the drape hides a myriad of secrets😘 Very feminine! If you bend forward in front of someone, you might want to bring up your hand to your face/neck area to block the view, though there's a 50 50 chance the material will drape to the side and take care of it. The material is 95% polyester, 5% spandex. Instructions say Machine wash, ""do not tumble dry"". I'll take my chances with low setting. The fabric is thick enough to not be translucent and thin enough to drape well. I'm thinking of ordering in more colors.",178

Menopausal mom, holding my weight in my upper body and stomach area. I ordered a large, and I am glad I did. I almost always opt for the XL regardless of reviews because I do not like any type of restriction. The xl here may have been too boxy around mid section. I love this shirt. It drapes nicely to hid my stomach yet doesn’t look frumpy. Tall girls, this will be short on you! I am 5’3” and it sits right at my Jean pockets on high waist. The neck drapes nicely and it can be dressed up or down. I ironed it out of package and haven’t washed it yet, so not sure if it’ll need ironing every time. Hope this helps. I see SO many reviews where people do not put what size they bought or what size THEY are, which makes the review fairly useless, so I included it all.",218

Be aware… it is a bit high maintenance.  I got an XL and I’m 5’8,195lb. It’s long enough for me, which was great. The front of the shirt isn’t sewed to itself, which is what creates the flowy, draped look. Because of that the front fabric flaps out when you put it on and you’ll have to tuck it back down.  I also used 3 pieces of dress tape to secure it: one piece on each bra strap to hold it and one piece to hold the v shaped neck line together. If you had a seated job, this may not be necessary but I teach elementary school and move around a lot, so I didn’t want it shifting. I liked it enough to keep it.",64
