It’s exactly what I was looking for. It fits loose which I appreciate and it’s sooo soft and comfy. I also love that it’s long enough to cover my butt but not so long that it looks like a dress. I think it’s very flattering. I can wear it lazying around the house or out and about with a pair of yogas on or even with a cute shorts and flip flops. So it’s very functional. The color is a nice shade of gray with thin white stripes. It’s not too thick and not too thin so it’s breathable. The fabric quality seems very good.  I think it’s a great value for the money. I’d def recommend!,8
