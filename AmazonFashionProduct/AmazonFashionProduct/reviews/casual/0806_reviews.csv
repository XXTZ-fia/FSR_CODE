I ordered the olive green, so other colors may not have such an obvious finish. But I think it would look a little out of place in a business meeting, unless the meeting was being held over a steak dinner. The shirt itself runs true to size and is soft and comfortable. I washed it in cold water and dried it on low and it is indeed wrinkle free. It's a nice shirt, it just doesn't strike me as an everyday shirt.",

The only reason I rated it a four-star is because it is advertised as being wrinkle free, however, I cannot attest to that because it arrived full of wrinkles and required ironing. Aside from that, definitely worth purchasing.",

I really did not like the way it is manufactured. It reminds me of those shirts people used to wear in Vegas in the '70s that you can even see in some Columbo movies. I just cannot get past this. HOWEVER, I tried it on and my wife told me I really look good in it, so I am sold. No, I do not look like Columbo, and I usually do look good in button-down shirts, which may play to my advantage. There are also some very nice things about this shirt. First, it arrived vacuum packed and upon unpacking it, I see very little wrinkling, so the manufacturer is definitely truthful about this. Besides the '70s impression, the manufacturing quality is very good. I am sure this shirt is going to last. The material is very, very thick. And I mean thick! I would not wear this in summer, but it will be very comfortable for the fall/winter season. Be aware that the white (this is the color I picked) is not 100% bright. Even under strong light it appears ever so slightly off-white. Finally, I would not pair this with a suit, but I recommended for occasion when the dress code is casual as the collar is not rigid enough for a tie and the fit is quite relaxed. I would say that this is ideal for a work barbeque gathering on a fall evening.",2

Shirt sizes can vary wildly from manufacturer to manufacturer; I normally wear a 15-16 neck, 32/33 sleeve in a dress shirt so I opted for medium as I don't mind being a little over-sized for casual wear. The medium turned out to be just right, sits well on the shoulders and not too long in the sleeves. The color I chose was olive green; I would almost call this a slate green because of the dark undertones; but since pictures speak louder, I've included a picture of the shirt with a color-checker so if you have Lightroom or equivalent, you can color correct for your monitor and get a good sense of the color. Either way, I really like the color, and think it pairs well with jeans or slacks equally.  Out of the shrink wrap package, it has a few folds as expected, but after a wash I'm sure the wrinkle free-ness (is that a word?) will shine due to the material: 65% poly, 30% viscose, and 5% spandex. For all man-made material, the shirt is very soft, and the spandex gives it a little bit of stretch. I also like that the cut is such that you can wear it untucked and not look sloppy. I'm looking forward to the cooler months so I can put this shirt into my regular rotation.  Pros: soft material, great casual look/can be worn untucked, wrinkle-free, great color Cons: none noted Rating: 5 of 5",2

This is not a bad thing since it shows build quality. I am a large man and 2xl is what I normally wear. Since this is a bit stretchy, if you are, like me, preferring some relax fit options, you need to go for a size up or it will show your belly. Other than that, no complaints about the comfort and quality. It would look better on a more athletic person. Recommended for a stylish cozy less formal wear",2
