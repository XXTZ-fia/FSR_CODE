The material is soft and has just the right amount of stretch to make it super comfortable, and the relaxed fit feels perfect – not too baggy but not tight either. It’s the kind of shirt that works well for running errands, hanging out with friends, or just wearing around the house. I also love the two chest pockets; they add a nice touch without looking bulky.  What really makes these shirts stand out for me is how well they hold up. I’ve washed mine over and over, and they still look great – no shrinking, fading, or weird stretching. The fabric is a little on the thicker side, so they’re perfect for cooler weather or layering, but maybe not the best choice on a really hot day. My only minor complaint is that the buttons feel a little cheap compared to the rest of the shirt, but it hasn’t been a big issue for me.  All in all, this is a solid, reliable shirt that looks good and feels great. I’ve stocked up on multiple colors and wear them all the time. If you’re looking for something comfortable, durable, and easy to throw on for just about anything, you can’t go wrong with this one.",

These will work well in cool to cold weather. I don't recommend them for 90° heat that I first wore them in.  I have since ordered a proper one that is the Wrangler riggs long sleeve 100% polyester and is essentially rip stop. These are very nice, breath, and dry out quickly. Never put in drier.

I wash them in cold water and dry for 10 minutes to fluff them up and line dry.  If you are really into it, I suppose they probably need ironing but I don’t mind a few wrinkles when more are going to appear after wearing for a bit anyway.  Make sure you get the 100% cotton shirts because some offered on this listing are heavily polyester.  If you like less ironing that may be for you but I prefer the cool cotton chambray shirts.  I have both the light and dark chambray colors.  The dark chambray is slightly more heavier weight cotton.",3

The fabric feels durable and well-made, with a nice texture that adds a bit of character to the shirt. It's clear that Wrangler has put a lot of thought into the construction, as the stitching is strong, and the buttons are securely attached. This shirt seems built to last, making it a great addition to any wardrobe.  However, I found that the sizing runs larger than expected. While I appreciate a relaxed fit, this shirt feels a bit too oversized (I’m 6’0” and 185lbs — ordered a Large) especially in the sleeves and shoulders. If you're someone who prefers a more tailored or true-to-size fit, you might want to consider sizing down. Despite this, the quality and design are excellent, so with a little adjustment, it can still be a great piece to wear.  I will keep the Large I ordered, as I might be able to layer it in the Fall/Winter. But I will be ordering and sizing down to a Medium for a better fit.",5

Actually while I'm here,  the shirts are OKAY,  I like the sunglasses cleaner that is on the bottom of the shirt, although I don't believe the material to be high quality- think swimming trunks. But not bad honestly. What they call brown is a slate dark gray. The Off white has a slight yellow hue. The blue jeans colored one will only look that color right under a light and looks more of a bluish-Heather grey. I like that they're not too long so you can wear them untucked and it will still land on your waist line,  it's a somewhat tight fit but still true to size.  (Ie order your normal sizes) I wish the price was less, and they were better at describing the colors.  These do not have snaps, which would really make them awesome (imo) I'd be weary of the rip possibilities under the arms, (mine are all new) no issues really,  just colors are not like the pictures .
