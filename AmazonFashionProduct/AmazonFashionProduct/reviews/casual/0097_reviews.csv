The material is completely different, instead of being more of a cotton/polyester blend which it claims to be (which is what my orange/pink sweater is) it's a shiny, spandex material. Not only did they cheap out on the material but the cut and style is completely different as well. I was hoping this was a one off, and sent it back, and ordered a different color (green) and it was exactly the same as the cheap looking black sweater that was returned. It's just a huge disappointment that corners are obviously being cut to make an extra buck. I would've continued to buy these sweaters for myself and others if the quality had remained the same.
