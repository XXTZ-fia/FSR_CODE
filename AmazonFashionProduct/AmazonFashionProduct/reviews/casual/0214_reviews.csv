The vibrant coral pink shade is eye-catching and perfect for the season, adding a splash of color to any outfit. The blouse features a loose, casual fit which makes it extremely comfortable, especially on warmer days. The V-neck cut adds a subtle elegance, making it versatile enough to pair with jeans for a casual look or with a skirt for a more dressed-up occasion. The fabric is soft and breathable, making this top a favorite for everyday wear. Overall, it's a great buy for anyone looking for a comfortable, stylish, and easy-to-wear summer tee.",

I wear between a large and X-Large in tops.  I bought a large and it fits the way I like but if I were intending to wear this as a tunic top I would need to have gotten an xl.  The cut is cute, it’s not too low.  The fabric is a mid weight.  The color is beautiful and has sort of a heather pattern which I like.  Sleeves are plenty long for covering arm fat.  There is nothing to dislike about this top.",12

It feels like an extra soft T-shirt, so it is very comfortable. However, the details make it look a little dressier and nicer than a plain T-shirt. I am looking forward to using this as part of my summer wardrobe.  I purchased an XL after reading the sizing and measuring myself and I am very happy with the fit. It has a nice drape and doesn't cling to me.",

I like loose-fitting shirts that are comfortable to wear around the house or while running errands (since I work from home with the kids). This shirt checks all the boxes.  It’s made of t-shirt material, so I probably wouldn’t wear it into the office, but it looks nice enough that I can wear at home while on Zoom calls, and not look like I’m a mess…but still comfy. I ordered a medium (currently 145lbs, 5’3”) and it’s perfect for what I want. That said - if you want a more fitted shirt, I’d size down. I was either a small or medium BEFORE kids, and this medium is still loose on me when I’m heavier than usual. But this is cute, love the color - I’d order again in different colors.",3

The stitching seems decent. There is one area on the neckline that seems sketchy so I'll keep an eye on it to see if the threads pull loose but for right now, it's all good. I can see myself wearing this shirt a lot. It's very cool and comfortable. I like it and will recommend it.",
