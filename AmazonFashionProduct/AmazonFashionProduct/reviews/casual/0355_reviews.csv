It’s the cut of the pants that’s off. I tried to make them work but will be returning them. I am 5’7” and usually wear a size 14. I ordered an XL after reading the reviews. The crotch hangs too low, if I pull them wayp up past my belly button a few inches below my bra, they are too short. No one is going to wear them that way. They just fit in the thigh and they pull in an odd way when I bend my leg. The pattern is made for someone who is of a shorter stature with thin thighs and no backside.",
