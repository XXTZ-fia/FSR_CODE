Jennifer Berardi,So Cute!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O4D9FD8ASUVS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNPRQ7TQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: Army GreenSize: X-Large,,"I absolutely love the army green color of this top, and the lace sleeves give it a little extra touch of style. It fits true to size and the cut is flattering. The material is soft, thin-ish but not too thin, and a good weight for spring & summer, though it could easily be worn indoors in cold weather. It would look cute with a different color king-sleeve underneath so the lacey sleeves stand out more. It is soft and comfortable, and definitely worth the price! I might buy it again in other colors. Totally adorbs!",
A Vine Reviewer,Love this Top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26A6GQV215KG1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNPRQ7TQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Color: Wine RedSize: Medium,,"I purchased this for a nice, easy top to wear to the office.  It is very flattering on.  The ribs on the neckline are flattering.  The shirts sit just right on my body - hiding imperfections and love handles, but no looking frumpy at all.  The lace sleeves elevate it so I can wear a t-shirt to work but look like I'm not.  Hello comfort and functionality.  I purchased mine in the plummy purple color.  SO FLATTERING!  I am delighted.",
Dr. R,Summer versatility,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RS1F7CWMW7M7J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNPRQ7TQ,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Color: Army GreenSize: Large,,"Soft, thin material Great for summer Comfortable Pretty Versatile I can wear it with many different bottoms to dress up or down.  Because of material is clingy, if your bra has any raised patterns, like embroidery, they will show through the shirt. I had a change bras to wear the shirt.",

Amazon Customer,Very cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R233NF3OWK3CTY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNPRQ7TQ,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: KhakiSize: Small,,I love the way this fits! It's loose enough to be comfortable but is fitted in the right places. It does have some small white threads that are large and out of place so I'm not sure what to make of that. The fabric is soft and stretchy. The color is very pretty. It looks just like the listing other than those white threads that are randomly placed.,

I ordered the olive green and it’s really pretty. I normally wear a large but this fits a little tighter in my abdomen area than I’d like, but covered with a shawl or cardigan it won’t be an issue.",

Denver303,Unique and versatile,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R399KDZQD1BVUQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNPRQ7TQ,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 3, 2025",Color: Wine RedSize: Medium,,"I really like the unique sleeves on this top. They are pretty, feminine and make this a shirt I can wear both professionally and casually. The fabric is soft with a little bit of stretch that lays nicely without being too snug or binding. I ordered a medium and it fits great across the bust and arms, although it’s a little long making it tunic length. Unfortunately, that means I will have to tuck it in for work which can cause bunching at my waist, which I’m not a fan of. Overall, it’s a comfortable and versatile top. I just wish it wasn’t so long.",

jmedhay,Form Fitting,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34BPJINVGWHX4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNPRQ7TQ,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 30, 2024",Color: Army GreenSize: Large,,This khaki green shirt is cute but is more clingy/fitted than I prefer.  I do like the lace sleeves and pleated top so that it doesn’t look like a T-shirt.  You could definitely wear this to work dressed up or with jeans for a more causal look.  The material is soft I just wish it was more blousey.  I do think it also runs a little small so would suggest sizing up.,2
