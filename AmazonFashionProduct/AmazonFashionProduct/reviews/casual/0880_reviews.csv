I have washed and dried it (in my dryer on ""light"") and it held up well, didn't shrink and came out of the dryer still a bit damp, but with no wrinkles.  It is true to size....fits me well, but loose....sleeves are long enough and the colors are pretty.  The 4-star review is because the fit is pretty loose and looks a straight and  boxy if you don't turn it under or tuck it in anywhere, but it is really comfortable.  For the $35 price tag, I feel it should have more shape.Side note: I have been a Vine member for almost a year and I give totally honest reviews. To earn 5 stars, the products I review have to be really well made, perform extremely well, and have a decent price point. I have no qualms coming back to revise my reviews if products fail to perform or turn out to be junk.",3

There is some slight bunching of the fabric near my arm pit (hence 4 stars, not 5), but it is not enough for me to want to return.  I am considering ordering this in another color, and will try a medium.  I ordered the dark green, and the color is absolutely beautiful.  It looks more army green in the picture but in reality is a dark moss green.  It can be dressed up or down, and is a nice mid-weight. ribbed-knit sweater - perfect for our mild South Texas winters.
