A little thin but not shear and good quality with nice stitching. The length I can’t love enough! I do dislike all these women clothes with super short waist and sleeves. Not this shirt it is long in the sleeves and would fit even a long torso person nicely! The v neck is a deep v but it’s perfect for me.

For bigger girls, I'd recommend a size up if you don't like it conforming too much. It is lightweight and the sleeves are just the right length to me. I haven't washed it yet, but it doesn't seem like it would shrink, but again, I've never seen a material like this so that's still to be determined if it will shrink or stay the same. Overall, for this price, it was worth the gamble for me.",

An XL is too big in the neckline and if I put my shoulder seams where they belong the V neck dips waaay far below and shows most of my chest. Yet the arms are tight and it clings and bunches up. A Large still exposes an excessive amount of my “girls” and highlights muffin top and my slight but ever-present rolls from my inexpensive bra. I returned both L and XL and will  be looking for a long sleeved v-neck T with a more substantial cotton/polyester material and holds its shape and doesn’t cling.,
