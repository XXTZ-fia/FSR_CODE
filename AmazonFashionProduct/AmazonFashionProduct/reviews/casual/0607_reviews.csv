It’s cold right now even in Florida! I loved the colors in this particular V-neck shirt.  I purchased a large and it fits nicely. I have not washed it yet or worn it, but I will make sure I will not put this in the dryer for several reasons. If you want anything looser, you might want to size up, but it is true to size with no room to give  The material of this is kind of I would say funky. It’s a thinner material that’s a little shiny. I’m hoping that it is a shirt that will hold up as long as I wash it carefully and hang it to dry. The other glitch is as you see from the picture, there is no drying instructions. That makes me very cautious, which I usually am for my shirts and I hang them all to drive but once in a while one does get stuck in the dryer. I don’t like when there is no drying instructions not just for me, but for anybody that buys this shirt.  Once I wear this a few times, if it holds up, I would probably purchase another one since it was such a variety of color overall, it was a good purchase.",2
