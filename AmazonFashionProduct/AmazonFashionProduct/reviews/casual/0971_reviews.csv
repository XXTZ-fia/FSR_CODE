Customer Review,Nice feminine top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OKYCV73IFMGP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP427LLN,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",,,I am a 36C petite - so I selected a small. The top looks nice/feminine and fits my body perfectly. The waffle material is a nice soft texture. I just love the shoulder caps - gives the top an expensive appearance.  Flattering and well made - I recommend!,
C Barrera,Soft but a tiny bit sheer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C3UQW6KV85WP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP427LLN,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Pink,,"I am obsessed with the vintage look of this incredibly soft top. The shell is an incredibly soft knit fabric that is the tiniest bit sheer due to the waffle knit style, and the cotton eyelet sleeves are almost a tulip or flutter sleeve but are all one piece. The cutouts give some fin flair an the top hits right at the hip bone so I can wear untucked if I choose. I will have to wear a camisole or slip underneath but this is not a big deal since I love the top so much. It's a loose fit and the pink is a beautiful ballet pink color. I am very happy with this and can't wait to wear it!",
Mimi W,A good choice for the upcoming heat in the summer- stays fresh looking,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TXZVQTDDA8E2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP427LLN,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Rose Red,,This waffle knit top has short sleeves of eyelet in matching Rose Red and decorative trim around the crew neck.  I usually wear a 14-16 but I order my tops in XX size to allow for shrinkage in washing/drying and different sizing.  This fits loosely and feels very soft against the skin.  The waffle knit is stretchy- another plus.  The top isn't bulky and looks nice under a shirt  and the color is really lovely.  No smell to fabric when I unpacked it.,
Irene Grimes,Very happy with this top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3A54B4RWGRZJT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP427LLN,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Blue,,"I was very pleasantly surprised when I received this - the material is soft and drapy without being flimsy. The workmanship appears to be really good, and it fits better than expected. The color is as it appeared on my monitor (which was also somewhat of a surprise) - I have not washed it yet, so the jury is out on how it will come out of the sash (will update this review if needed). I can see wearing this for business meetings, lunches out in town and many other occasions. I think it can be dressed up or down very easily. I would definitely order this again!",
D_Doll,Elevated summer t-shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19IF0I2C5PLIP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP427LLN,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Khaki,,"This is a really nice, elevated t shirt for summer, or for layering. The texture of the fabric itself, paired with the detailing on the neckline and the eyelet style sleeves really make it easy to pull together outfits that are just a bit dressier than a regular t shirt. The fit is true to size, and the fabric itself is very soft. It is easy care, machine washable, although due to the detailing around the neck I washed mine in a mesh laundry bag and dried on low still in the bag to keep it from getting caught on any buttons. It turned out perfectly, and seems like it will travel well. This is definitely a very versatile piece, and will definitely work with a lot of different styling options.",

It is very comfortable and runs true to size. The color is beautiful.  It washes very well.  I love the sleeves and how they accent the top.,
CRD,soft and cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HZDOGWQZRUE9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP427LLN,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Green,,"I love this top. It's soft, true to size and color and very cute. I love layering with tops like this to keep me from getting too hot or too cold. I washed on cold and dried flat, and it's perfect so far.",
Sandy T,This is a great top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KAQPL81QUQR9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP427LLN,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Size: LargeColor: White,,"The shirt is cute and comfortable.

SaraM,Womens Frenchy Summer Tops Crewneck Short Sleeve T Shirts Casual Waffle Knit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YEEPB45KMGZ7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP427LLN,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 2, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Khaki,,"This is the perfect Lightweight, Spring/Summer/Fall knit top in an a soft creamish-pink color.

594 Tuff,My Frenchy summer shirt.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LUFOAXYVVUAC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP427LLN,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 30, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: White,,"I saw this beautiful Frenchy, summery, short-sleeved, T-shirt and knew that this could look really special, or could be casual, or anywhere in between.  The fabric is a waffle knit jacquard that I chose in white so that it will be that much more special for me. The sleeves are gorgeous with their own personality as a cap sleeve. I also love the neckline since it has its own special look to it. The white shirt is really nice and special. The price is perfectly matched with the style of the shirt at $21.99.  I can also machine wash this shirt since it is made of mostly polyester, which is super soft against skin, and very easy to take care of. I am in awe of the soft waffle knit fabric. It can go with anything and any season. I personally can’t wait to wear this shirt with summer Linen shirts and flat sandals. Such a cute outfit.",
