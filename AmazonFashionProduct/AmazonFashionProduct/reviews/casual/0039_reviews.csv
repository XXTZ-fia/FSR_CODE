I normally wear an XL but if I reordered another color I’d probably size up to an XXL.

I came home from shopping and realized it was colder out than I thought, so I opened this up and put it on.  I love it!  I needed a classier casual jacket to wear when I was going out to dinner or going out with friends, so I ordered this one because of the black with the gold zipper.  It did not disappoint.  The gold with the black really makes it a dressier jacket even though it has sweatshirt like cuffs and waistband.  It is super soft and comfortable.  It is made of a material mix of polyester, rayon and spandex and feels so good against your skin.  I think it's meant to be a shorter jacket, but it fits a little longer on me.  I'm 5'1"" and weigh 135 lbs., so everything is a little longer on me :) I usually wear a small and that's what I ordered.  It fit as expected, even when zipped up.  You can never rely on the size charts, and their size chart is way off. I would go with the size you normally wear.  I am currently wearing it with shorts, but it would also look great with jeans or even some dressier khakis or black pants.  Another great feature is the pockets.  The are square pockets with flaps at the top.  Since they're not angled, you don't need a zipper to make sure your things don't fall out.  You just slip your phone, credit cards, money, keys, etc. in the pocket and make sure the flap is down and your things will stay put.  My only complaint is the zipper operation.  It works great until you get to the waistband.  It seems to catch at the waistband, so I have to pull it out a little to get past the inside material.  Then it slides right past.  Not a huge problem, but it is a little bit of a pain if you're trying to get out of the jacket quickly.  The zipper does work both ways (both up and down), so you could have it unzipped at the top and unzipped at the bottom to give it a little different look.  It's really cute, even for this 58-year-old, and I highly recommend it.",3
