The white showed up first and was very Large and it was just too sloppy looking on.  That Large measured 22” across from pit to pit when laying flat and 24” from shoulder to bottom hem.  The beige Large arrived and it measured 21 inches frompit to pit and 23 inches in length.  Clearly you just don’t know what will arrive.  Fortunately the beige Large fit fine now.Very pretty blouse.  I liked it more than I thought I would  LOL  Good length in the front so not necessary to tuck or do the front tuck.  For sizing, I am 5-2, 145 pounds and 36 bust.  I ordered the medium and it was still a bit snug at the top.  Like if you move your arms forward, very tight and also tight in the armpit area.  Shoulder seams are where they should be but I will try the next size up.  The medium did measure 20-1/4"" from pit to pit and my other blouses that measure the same aren't tight.  I can't figure it out.  They are currently sold out in the Large/Beige, so I will wait for it to come back and then update my review for sizing.",

I bought it in the M and the L because of bust fit uncertainty. The medium fits perfectly everywhere with the right bra (a minimizer bra). Any other bra & its maybe 1/8 in snug through the boobs. But I'm losing weight so itll fit perfectly in another week or two. I am glad I ordered the large for a looser boob fit so I will have two white blouses if I stain one.
