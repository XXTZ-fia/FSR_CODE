The colors stayed bright and withstood many washings, allowing for the fact that I have multiple flannels and didn't wear and wash this shirt every week. For colder days, when the temperature is in the 30s, 20s I recommend heavier, ""Canadian"" style flannel, but for nicer winter days, this was my favorite flannel shirt, and I will be buying the exact same shirt again.",

Not all sizes run true, and all too many brands will shrink. This shirt beats all expectations.  Great colors that appear colorfast,  true to size and no shrinking after two washes. I actually waited to wash and wear twice, so as to give a more informed opinion.All that said, at this price, buy several. This is a product that could easily be from carhartt or Dickies in terms of quality,  but at a fraction of the price.",
