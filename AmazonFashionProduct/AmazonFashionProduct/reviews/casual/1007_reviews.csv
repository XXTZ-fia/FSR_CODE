However it is thinner than most t-shirts. The thumb holes are perfect for germaphobe’s like myself when opening public doors.  Now the con’s…  With the top being as thin as it is, it’s not going to keep me as warm as I had hoped for. I mean it will be nice for warm (70°-75°) fall nights in Texas but for someone who’s always cold like myself this one isn’t going to work. The listing does not mention anything about it being an oversized shirt and yes I seen how it looks on the model. However, we all know it’s hard to trust the photos when online shopping so we tend to size up. DON’T do it with this one lol. I am 5’4”, 175, and heavy up top so I ordered an XL. As soon as I pulled it out of the package I had to double check the size they sent me. This thing is freaking big and looks huge on me lol. It covers the booty like I wanted, covers the fupa like I wanted, but it also hangs to mid thigh lol. It has zero shape making me look even shorter and rounder. Seriously I could just add a belt wear as a dress or even wear it as a night shirt. All in all if you like the big and baggy look then this IS your top, but if you’re going for a more faltering look, order your normal size or maybe even try a size smaller lol. It may look good half tucked but I haven’t done that since the early 2000’s lol.",
