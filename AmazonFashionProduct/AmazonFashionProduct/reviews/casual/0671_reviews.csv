I'm pretty broke and spent money on a few pairs of Amazon Basics pants which were cheap but sort of a lot to me. The tan colored ones, after wearing them once, were exhibiting weird stains all over the front and back, blackish and brownish. I was really annoyed that these pants that I bought to wear to work were ruined after so little time and wear.  It then dawned on me: it's the belts. Whatever dye is being used on these belts runs off and stains your pants. Permanently. I didn't wear either belt in the rain, spill anything on them, or swear excessively. I just wore them. Now 3 pairs of pants are ruined and no question it's because of these belts. I don't know if anyone else has experienced this, but trust me this is truly my experience. Caveat emptor.",

I have purchased better Leather belts on Amazon. This is the first time that I have purchased a belt made by Dickies. I was looking for a new belt to eventfully replace 1 belt out of 2 I purchased from Amazon a pretty good while ago. I Would of liked to buy the same brand again but I was shocked to see that brand of belt that I purchased previously more then doubled in price and I wasn't going to pay double so I looked around Amazon and found the Dickies belt above. I tried it on today. Glad I purchased it one size bigger because it was one size smaller then what was listed on the belt. The belt size actually matched the last 2 belts I purchased on Amazon my true size but was listed as the next size belt up. Time will tell how long the Dickies belt lasts. The leather is a little thinner then the others I purchased on Amazon and the leather doesn't feel as flexible like the others I had purchased. Time will tell that I know for sure.,

I have a 36 waste. So I bought a 36. Most belts that I've bought have a couple notches in each direction.  This one is 36 at the very last notch almost to the very end and even then it's questionable. So the size you order is the very last notch in the belt with no room to make more.  My advice go up a couple sizes..,3

If you are someone like me who has fluctuating weight and sometimes can be two sizes or more at varying times of the year, this belt is not the most accommodating. There are only two holes for you to use and I suppose if you enjoy a short belt with a minimal amount of flap to tuck into the loop, this is not an issue then really. I probably will just get a belt twice the price next time that is not a major manufacturer, frugality is a cruse at times.",3

Right out of the box, I was impressed by the high-quality craftsmanship. The leather feels premium—soft yet durable, with just the right amount of flexibility for all-day comfort.  The design is sleek and timeless, making it versatile enough to wear with both casual jeans and formal dress pants. The buckle has a polished, understated look and operates smoothly without any annoying sticking or stiffness. Plus, the adjustment holes are spaced perfectly, allowing for a snug, custom fit.  What really stood out to me was how sturdy this belt is. After months of daily use, there’s no fraying, cracking, or stretching, which I’ve experienced with cheaper options. It holds up beautifully, even after long days of wear, and still looks as good as new.  If you’re looking for a reliable, stylish belt that you can count on for any occasion, this one’s a no-brainer. It’s a quality investment that elevates your wardrobe and provides outstanding durability. Highly recommend!",
