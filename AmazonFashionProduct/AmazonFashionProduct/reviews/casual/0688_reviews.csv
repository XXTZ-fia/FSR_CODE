I bought a similar version of this last year and wanted a replacement for that one as I loved it and get so many compliments on it whenever I wear it but it did get quite pilled after so much wear.

It’s not too tight but still gives a nice, flattering shape.  Stylish Design: The quilted pattern adds a nice touch of style, and the zipper detail makes it feel a little more elevated than your basic sweater.  Comfortable: It’s lightweight, so it’s perfect for layering, and it's not too heavy or bulky. Great for casual outings or just lounging around.  Cons: Limited Room for Layering: If you want to wear something loose underneath, like a t-shirt, it doesn’t allow for much extra room. It’s best suited for wearing with something fitted under it.  Not as Warm as Heavier Sweaters: It’s more of a lightweight sweater, so it’s not the best for super cold weather.  This sweater is great if you're looking for something stylish yet comfy. The fit is true to size, and it’s perfect for casual wear. Just keep in mind, it’s not meant for layering bulky items underneath. I’d definitely recommend it for anyone who wants a cute and comfortable sweater for everyday wear!",6

So much so I am contemplating getting another color 😅 They wash well, don’t shrink, don’t stretch out or fade over time. I have had 0 issues with the zipper. The gray one I have had for a couple of years now and it’s still going strong! These are easy to throw on and pack well for traveling. You won’t regret this purchase!",2
