These look like they’re shorts from early 2000s: loose and sits right above the knee (i got my usual size in small so i guess they come a bit on the larger/longer aide). The material is still though it feels unfinished in the interior. Like it’s supposed to be lined but isn’t. Pockets are deep enough. Drawstring feels cheap honestly. And the eyelet if the drawsteing is so short.,

I like that they're mostly made of cotton and you can really feel the quality. It's really difficult these days to find clothes that aren't made of polyester, so I was delighted to see these being 97% cotton. They are a bit stiff, but still stretchy and comfortable. The fabric feels soft. They have 2 side pockets, 1 pocket on the back and a drawstring. The stitching looks very good. Overall I'm very pleased with these shorts and would highly recommend them.",

These casual mostly cotton (97%, 3%) shorts are perfect for that. He prefers his shorts on the longer side so these are a great length for him.  The light khaki color matches the stock photos. It's thin but not see-through. The cotton feels good and crisp. After washing (normal cycle and drying in medium-high heat) the solid cotton material still feels crisp and no ironing required. I also did not notice any shrinkage after machine washing/drying.  Size small fits his waist is 29"" well.  I hope you find this information helpful with your purchasing decision.",

These Men's Casual Shorts Cotton Elastic Waist Drawstring Shorts Lightweight Summer Beach Shorts are just great.  The fit is spot-on perfect.  The 2 side pockets are perfectly positioned and they are nice and deep.  Best of all, the drawstring is really long. (It drives me crazy when shorts have a drawstring that's just a couple of inches long, not long enough to tie, and the drawstring retracts into the elastic band, never to be found again.) This drawstring is really long, and you can tie a nice bow (like with shoes) and still have a couple inches of drawstring left over.  The fabric of these shorts feels great. It's very sturdy without being thick or bulky. These shorts seem like they would wear forever.  These shorts are really nice, and I definitely recommend them.",
tlb,Comfortable and lightweight,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38WJGIZYJOA9G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHBZMFFF,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 6, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Denim Blue,,"I like Coofandy clothing because of the quality, cost and being true to size and these men's casual shorts are no exception.  I am 155 - 160 lbs., 5' 10"" tall and 34"" waist.  I ordered a large based on the sizing chart recommendations and the shorts fit very comfortably.  I ordered denim blue and would say the color is true with what is shown in the advertising.  I also like the blend of material, 93% cotton/3% spandex, because the shorts have more of a quality feel and have the look of casual shorts versus fitness shorts.  There are 2 side pockets and one in the back and they are not zippered.  The pockets are fairly deep and will easily hold my 6.5"" cellphone in the front without showing.  The back pocket is a bit more shallow and the top of my phone can be seen in the attached picture.  The waist has a drawstring for tightening so there are no belt loops.  The only thing I would changed on these shorts would be to have the drawstring tie on the inside of the waistband instead of the outside.  I feel the shorts would have a much nicer look that way because you wouldn't see the drawstring.Based on the quality, pricing, comfort and variety of color options I would not hesitate to recommend these shorts and I hope this review was helpful.",

Nice elastic waist band, ties are there when you need them.  Length is nice and lands just above the knee.  Pockets too!  They're like pants, that were shortened into shorts!  Nicely done! They are indeed comfortable and are easy enough to just toss in the washer with your regular clothes.  Can't beat that.  Overall, 8 out of 10 because the material is a little crispy out of the package.  After a few more washes I bet they soften up though.  Could be a 9 out of 10 at that point.  Worth the buy for sure.",

I can't speak to the colors, but this one matches the website. The pockets are nice and deep. You can wear these all day for regular wear, for something athletic, or whatever.
