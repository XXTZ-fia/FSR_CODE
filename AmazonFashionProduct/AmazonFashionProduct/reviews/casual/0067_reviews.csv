I didn't and so ended up sending the ""fleece"" back.  By the way, this is in no way fleece.  It is light weight and feels more like a synthetic blend that sticks to your body.  All those videos must be of very, very skinny men.  I am not fat and after reading a number of reviews that said the shirt was huge, I ordered a large as I planned to wear a heavy sweater or fleece under it to do barn work.  Well it is huge, but in weird places like the length of the arms and the overall length - halfway down my thigh.  Whatever this is supposed to be, I assure you it is not.",
