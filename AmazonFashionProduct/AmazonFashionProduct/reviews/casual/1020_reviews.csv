When they arrived, he was surprised to find that the material they are made from is thin enough to be used in a handkerchief. Hold them up to the light and you can just about see thru them. The material also feels like it's made of Nylon, fit in only the most generic fashion and the normal 2 front pockets per side are just one with stitching to indicate another. Lastly, he said they just feel cheap. All that said, if you're looking for bargain basement clothing that covers you up and you don't care how it looks or feels, then these short pants are for you.",

Inevitable White Man,Off Kilter Sizing (note that this review is NOT written by a professional reviewer or AI.),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LN2XXZ9A8J5W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09QT6H6NQ,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",Size: 38Color: Petrified Oak,Verified Purchase,"Size Matters.  I have a 43 inch waist and 43 inch hips, so whatever I wear naturally drops to hip-level, then I cinch it tight with a belt.  But these shorts make you feel like a winner, because the size 38 waist that I ordered fits good - maybe I am looking thinner.  However... they stretch (says they are stretchy in the description).  If you wear them for a half hour, they stretch to max capacity and become too loose, and won't reset until washed and dried again.  So I'm going to order a size 36 to properly fit my 43 inch hips.  I have no idea who holds the measuring tape at the factory, but I think they are trying to boost our self esteem.  Other than sizing, they are not wrinkle free, and the weight of the fabric is kind of light and will probably wear out quicker than most.  Overall, when you get the right size, they are a pretty good pair of shorts for knocking around the house, garage, yard, boat, or whatever doesn't require you to look like a super  star.",

It did, however, take me a few tries to get the right size. I have a 42"" waist, so I first bought a size 42, because a lot of reviewers reported that these shorts are true to size. That was not my experience. So I ordered a size 40, and they were still falling off me. I tried one more time, ordering a size 38, and this is the size that fits my 42"" waist. Go figure.  They are great for the summer. The fabric is not too thick to be comfortable, and not too thin to be durable. The pockets are what really sold me on these, though, especially the phone pocket. It provides perfect access to my phone at all times, while keeping it out of the way during most activities.  The front pockets are large, and deep, certainly large enough for any wallet you don't want to put in a back pocket or cargo pocket, as long as you don't mind the bulge it would make. The cargo pockets are great for wallets, as long as you don't need to access it much, because it takes two hands to open the Velcro opening and keep it from closing while you retrieve your wallet. Or at least it does, for me. A bit of a hassle.  TL:DR - These are great shorts once you figure out their sizes relative to your measurements. They fit well after that, seem sturdy, and the pockets are great. Go for it, but be prepared to return for wrong size, or buy a few sizes and return what doesn't work.",

From the very first wear, I could tell that these shorts were designed with both comfort and practicality in mind. The fit is perfect, thanks to the stretch fabric that moves with you rather than against you, making these shorts ideal for all-day wear.  One of the standout features of these cargo shorts is the material. The fabric blend provides just the right amount of stretch, allowing for a comfortable fit without feeling restrictive. Whether I'm out for a hike, running errands, or just lounging around, these shorts offer incredible flexibility and comfort. The material is also durable and stands up well to frequent washing without losing its shape or color.  The design of the Wrangler Authentics Men's Classic Cargo Stretch Shorts is both functional and stylish. The multiple pockets are a game-changer, offering ample storage space for my essentials. The cargo pockets are spacious and easily hold my phone, wallet, keys, and even a small notebook. The added convenience of having secure places to store my items without needing a bag is fantastic, especially when I'm on the go.  The craftsmanship of these shorts is top-notch. The stitching is strong and sturdy, ensuring that the shorts will last for years to come. The zipper and button closures are robust and reliable, adding to the overall quality of the product. The classic cargo style is timeless and versatile, making these shorts easy to pair with a variety of tops and footwear for different looks.  One aspect I particularly appreciate is the attention to detail in the design. The waistband is comfortable and sits just right, without digging in or slipping down. The length of the shorts is perfect, hitting just above the knee, which gives a modern yet classic look. The color options are also great, allowing me to choose a shade that fits my personal style.  These shorts have exceeded my expectations in every way. They offer a perfect blend of comfort, durability, and functionality, making them an essential addition to any wardrobe. Whether you're tackling outdoor adventures or just enjoying a casual day out, these shorts have you covered.",4
