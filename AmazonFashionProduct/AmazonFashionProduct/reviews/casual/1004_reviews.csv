Leather and buckle quality seems to be good for the cost. Sits great on all my pants and jeans. Over the past year, I have purchased multiple belts as my weight has dropped. Started with 38"" Timberland belt as I lost weight having previously used another brand's 42"" belt.  Then to 36"" and now to 34"" belt. Each belt and variety of colors I've purchased have provided me comfort and security holding up my pants. I was also able to drill additional holes to the larger belts to allow for tightening as my waist size reduced. Size suggestions tend to be to order 2"" greater than pants waist size. I have been down to 34"" pants for a while using 36"" Timberland belts for a while. I found that I was having to use the final hole of the 36"" belt and have now purchased 34"" belt. I am on the 2nd and sometimes 3rd hole of the 34"" belt. Therefore, I'd suggest considering it may be best to order same size belt as pants waist size for some people. But if you prefer to be safe, go with the 2"" larger size than pants size method and be willing to drill holes at some point if you need to tighten.",2

I guess this is a matter of what you had before.  This belt replaces one I got at some mall store 25 years ago (and wore nearly every day since).  I measured the thickness of that belt at about 0.150"".  The Timberland belt is roughly 0.125"" (1/8"").  Seems a small difference but I can definitely feel the difference.  And let's face it, that's about 30% thicker.Also, the product image depicts a cast prong - the belt I got has a stamped prong.  Again, not a huge difference but the stamped prong is thinner and has sharper edges.  It doesn't have quite the quality feel of a cast part.  It also can cause issues if the sharper edges begin tearing into the leather.It's hard to tell but it does seem like full grain leather which should help with longevity - so that's nice.Overall, not too bad for the price but I'm not expecting 25 years out of it.",6
