I wanted something casual and this fit the bill.  It fits true to size and is on the longer side, which I prefer.  This can be dressed up or kept very casual.  The material has a quality feel about it and the stitching is professional.  I have had other blouses where the stitching is uneven and sometimes loose, but this top is not like that at all.  I would definitely recommend this and will probably look at buying another one in a different color.",5

The fabric is soft but substantial and the cut hangs loose enough to cover any problem areas. It is a fairly inexpensive top but I have some JJill tops that are very similar that cost me a lot of money. I washed it in gentle cycle and hung it to dry and it came out perfect. No wrinkles. I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a high quality summer top.,2

The material is thin and soft to touch making it comfortable to wear.,

I could have gotten away with a Large. The fit is “boxy” but not in an unflattering way- it actually helps elevate the look of the shirt making it more dressy. It has a deep v-neck. The sleeves are cuffed and a bit short because of my broad shoulders but not too bad. The length is moderate but the shirt also has some stretch to it. The color is an eggplant purple and very beautiful.,2
