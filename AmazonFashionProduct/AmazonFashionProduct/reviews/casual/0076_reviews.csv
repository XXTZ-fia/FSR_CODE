I have the black, green and brown.  If you want warm, this is not it.  It is a thinner, silky feeling material that washes and dries well and does not pill.  Pretty tough to wrinkle unless you really ball it up and then put some weight on it.  They do run large.  First one was an XXL.  Lost 70 pounds so I got another in large.  That still was a bit large.  So went for the medium when I bought the brown one.  Still loose but not overly so.  I'm 5'5"" and weigh 170 pounds, 40C.  The XXL fit loosely when I weighed 247.",

The black color goes with everything, making it super versatile for both casual and more dressed-up outfits.  The material is soft and lightweight, yet cozy enough to keep me warm during cooler days. The long sleeves provide extra coverage, and the overall fit is flattering without being too tight or restrictive.

Perhaps a small would have been a better choice. It did have an overall nice cut and felt like a decent quality, but I just couldn't make this work. The fabric was lighter weight and comfortable so no complaints there. But I couldn't get over the color and over-size of this shirt and ended up returning it. Unless you're going for an oversized look, I would suggest sizing down. The stripped pattern is very prominent so be sure to order in a color you really like as it's not subtle.",

The color really stands out and adds a nice touch to any casual outfit.  I absolutely love this sweater! It’s lightweight, so it’s easy to wear without feeling too warm, but still cozy enough for cooler days. Overall, I’m really happy with it and would definitely recommend it!",2

It’s oversized so it would fit easily over other shirts. The ribbed waist and the ribbed wrist pieces are not out of the same material and more like a normal sweatshirt would have. The hood is a single layer of fabric with the seam exposed on the inside of the hood. I ordered the Rose Red, which is a nice bright/hot pink, in a size Small. If you prefer a more fitted look, you may want to size down.",

This pullover hoodie does have the front pouch pocket to keep your hands warm (or for storage). The waist is banded, it does not hang down or drape. This pullover hoodie does attract string and pet hair (both of which brush right off).",2
