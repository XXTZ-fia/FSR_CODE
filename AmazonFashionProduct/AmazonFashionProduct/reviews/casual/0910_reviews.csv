Jessica Alyce,So Beautiful! My new FAV!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32BMZ9PW2RCQ8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CC21XJBD,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 7, 2024",Size: MediumColor: A1 Green,Verified Purchase,"Y'all, this dress is so beautiful and so soft! 🤩Words won't do justice, but I will try. First of all it came out of the package with zero wrinkles due to the amazing fabric texture and the color is EXACTLY what is in the picture. You will immediately feel the weight and quality. It's almost silky while having a sweater type look (thread-wise, not thickness) I got the size amazon suggested for me and it fit PERFECTLY! I am shaped similar to the model in the picture and the dress looked just like the picture when on. (I say this for length, waist and neck.) The fabric is almost as thin as a silk dress. You may want a slip, as it is very form fitting, it shows every little curve yet not see though (I tried on the light blue/grey, I think they called it green, with biege bra and black underwear) I have always had a fantastic experience with Dookatoo dresses and I always get compliments when I wear this brand. You can trust that you are going to fall in love with this dress and even the brand. *PLEASE NOTE* I wouldn't suggest hanging this dress as it is weighted, I wouldn't want it to stretch itself out. Being that it came from the package with no wrinkles,I will probably fold it only. I hope you have the same lovely experience! 🥰",14

To work, out to lunch, to a party, outdoor event with some cute tights, I can very easily be dressed up or dressed down. I found this dress to be very well-made and I love the color in green. I’ve gotten so many compliments on this. I have not had any problems with wrinkling. I washed this on the delicate cold cycle and air dry. This is what it looks like after air drying with no ironing or steaming. No problems with the stitching. The dress is warm, but it won’t make you sweat. Very worth it, especially for the price.

It is indeed pretty big/not tight, but it hugs my body all the wrong ways and shows all the bumps in the hip area. I already washed it and cut the tags off, so I can't return it, but thought others should beware that it may not be as flattering as it is for others!",7
