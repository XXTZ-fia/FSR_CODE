The ivory white is pretty close to a true white.  Loved them so much, in fact, that I then ordered red, black & beige.  The simple ruffle is flattering for a small-busted person like me.  I ordered a medium (I'm 5.4"", 133 lbs).  And it fits really well.  I'd prefer the width at the bottom to be maybe a smidge bigger as I'm not especially slim in the hips, but really it looks and feels just fine.  I like wearing it not tucked in.  The first washing removed most of the wrinkles.  The second washing removed them all.  I've been drying them on a rack - where they dry very quickly.  I get lots of compliments.  I wear them to work and also to dress up slightly for social events.",
