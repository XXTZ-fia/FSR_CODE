They're easy to pull on/off, they're not confining and the high waist doesn't dig in or roll down.  I am 5'6 and I love the length. They're longer than most, and with a platform sneaker, these almost touch the ground, but I prefer that. Because they're longer than most, they can be work with a higher heeled shoe. The flare stars just below the knee but isn't such a bell bottom flare that it's goofy looking. It's a nice simple flare that looks great with any kind of shoe, and they're not too thin like some yoga pants can be. They're truly opaque.  Love the quality and fit! Definitely recommend.",

Generally a standard inseam is about right for me (at 5'7"" with proportionate measurements), and I think that's usually 31-32"" depending on brand. These leggings were like 2"" too long, so they dragged on the ground when I didn't have shoes on. That's nice for wearing larger heels or taller platforms but annoying when you're lounging at home. Otherwise, these are exceptionally comfortable and seem well made. The pockets fit my phone and the waistband is comfortable and not too tight, but does not slide down either. I may try to hem them a bit so I can wear them with sandals or just slippers around the house without them dragging on the ground.",

I really love both the high waistband, it's comfortable and not tight and how the seaming details and faux fly front make these leggings look more stylish. The side pockets are designed well because even though they're placed in the thigh area, they don't add any bulk and are actually functional enough to hold small items.

Plus, their inseam is actually long enough for me; no more high water pants or showing sock! They do run a little small. I typically order XL for these types of pants, but I’m glad I went up to the XXL, because they would have been stretched a bit too thin and we don’t want to be popping any seams.

Functional Pockets: The addition of pockets is a huge plus—they’re practical and don’t add bulk to the sleek design.  At 5'4"", I found the pants a little long, so they work best with heeled shoes or boots. If you’re on the shorter side, you might need to hem them or pair them with taller footwear.

Once they arrived, I could tell I should've ordered the size recommended by the size chart because the pants are unfortunately too big, which is such a bummer because they are cute! It's definitely my fault, so no stars deducted. I think the bottom half of the size chart is most helpful, where it lists height and weight recommendations, that's the one that said I should order a small. About the fit, they do come up very high on your waist, like above the belly button, but not uncomfortable. And they are plenty long enough, like too long on a shorter girl like me. The fabric is definitely stretchy, and feels like it will be cooling if you are warm, it's not thick at all. These would be great for work, school, running errands, probably even exercising.

I’m 5’6” and they reach the floor without shoes but don’t drag. Long enough that I could wear heels if I wanted to. Seriously, don’t hesitate to order a pair of these. They’re unbelievably comfortable. You won’t regret it.",
Linda S,Great Fabric,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DPAZ4YPXXVAS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLW78W38,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 11, 2023",,,"The best thing about these pants is the fabric.  It is soft and stretchy and feels very upscale.  The cut is comfortable and loose, if not terribly flattering.  I love the deep pockets.  They are ideal for lounging, which is one of my favorite activities.They are quite short on me, though.  I am taller than average, 5'8"", and this is often an issue, but I ordered a Medium instead of a Small hoping that would help!  The model in the image I am thinking is maybe 5'4"" as the length on her is great.",2
