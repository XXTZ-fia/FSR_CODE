Jill Ingenito,HONEST review of this affordable yet fall fashion find for my husband,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1D9RJO5IB2RS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C2D3BMC8,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 17, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Navy Heather,Verified Purchase,"Great Quality & Affordable Fashion Find!  My husband has always had a hard time finding affordable yet stylish clothing online, but this Hanes Men’s Beefy-T Henley Shirt in navy really impressed us! The fabric is soft, thick, and feels like it’s built to last, which is exactly what he needed. The fit is true to size, and the cotton material makes it super comfortable for everyday wear.  He loves the Henley style because it’s a step up from a basic tee without feeling too formal. The long sleeves are perfect for cooler days, and the color is rich and classic. It’s a great staple piece that works well for casual outfits or even for layering.  The best part? It’s budget-friendly! It’s hard to find affordable fashion online that doesn’t compromise on quality, but this shirt checks all the boxes. We’ll definitely be purchasing more colors in the future.  Highly recommend for anyone looking for a quality, affordable shirt for their wardrobe!",39

They were truly heavy weights, or beefy you could say, which I enjoy in the winter.  They are wearing out now.  The first replacement I found online was light weight and that put me on a long 'unfulfilled' search.  Probably my fault, but I came across these guys marketed as ""Beefy"" and bought one.  Nice shirt, but it belongs in the lighter weight category.  ""Beefy"", it is not.  This is the reason I gave it four stars instead of five.  Just know it is marketed as something it isn't.  It's half way close to the description, though, and I like it well enough to buy more, especially at the good price they offer..",

Ordering a small is usually never a problem in any company purchased but I'm going to probably order a large in replacement for this Small because of shrinkage when washed and dried.  That's how small it is.  I'm surprised because Hanes is a good brand.  Order at least one size bigger than normal and keep your fingers crossed.  If you need width then this shirt is not for you. The length is 27 inches from the back of the collar to hem. The sleeve length from the top of the shoulder is 25.5 inches. The armpit to armpit is 17.25 inches. Across the bottom hem is 17.5 inches.  Normal t shirt type material, not a soft blend. Maybe after laundry and  fabric softener that will change.  Overall nice shirt but again runs very small and slim.",43
