The body length is quite long which I absolutely love, as I usually struggle to find shirts I feel are long enough (I'm 5'8"" with a longer torso, so I hate shirts that are too short.)  If you're a shorter person it may seem dress-like though, just as a warning if that's a problem for you.  I absolutely love this shirt and will probably get a couple more colors.  I ordered a Medium since that is my normal size, and I knew it was supposed to be an oversized shirt.  I may order another one in a Small just to see how it compares, but I like the oversized nature of my ""normal"" size.  For reference ,I'm 5'8"", 165 pounds, ~39"" bust.

Texas Shopper,"Soft, comfy, stretchy. Pretty pale pink!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19OAHJ0PW7IJD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5RDN86D,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 27, 2024",Color: PinkSize: XX-Large,,"I chose this shirt in pale pink and the color is so soft and pretty! Unfortunately, I had trouble accurately capturing the color with my camera; in two of my photos it looks almost white but the shot with the white door in the background shows the pink color a little better. In the seller's photos, the fabric looks heathered, like it has some other color of threads mixed in with the pink, but the shirt I received is not heathered, the color is a solid pastel pink, a very clear, pretty, and feminine color. The fabric is lightweight and soft. The 60% polyester gives it strength and helps it resist shrinking or fading, while the 35% rayon gives it a natural, cottony texture and a nice drape. The 5% spandex is for stretch.  This shirt would be a good choice for you tall ladies out there because it is very long with very long sleeves. I am short (5'1"") and the sleeves are very long on me, and with the shirt's extra length, I could wear it as a night shirt. Despite the overly long sleeves, I really love the oversized design of this shirt; it's long enough that it totally covers my derriere so I can feel confident when wearing leggings that I don't look inappropriate. At my age and fitness level, I don't need to be showing off my backside. I did go up a size because I wanted it to fit good and loose around my chubby tummy. That probably contributed to it being extra long, but it's a good trade in my case. I really like the raglan sleeves; they have a subtle but cute stitching detail. The thumb holes are a nice extra as well. Another feature I like is the hem that curves slightly higher on the sides and dips down lower in the front and back; in my opinion, this is much more flattering than a shirt cut straight across the bottom.  Overall, this shirt is soft, oversized, comfortable -- a great shirt for working out, hanging out, lounging, etc. It is perfect for cool weather and can be layered under a jacket or sweats when the weather turns colder.",5

I have average length legs and longer-than-average arms and torso. Because of this, many shirts fall shorter than I like on the waist, and most long sleeve shirts end up being about an inch shy of where the sleeves should fall on my arms. I frequently end up ordering an XL for that extra bit of length in the sleeves, though it’s an awkward competition between getting sleeves that are long enough without looking like I’m swimming in the bagginess of larger sizes.  I took a risk with this shirt based on the model picture and ordered a Large. It fits. The sleeves aren’t as long on me as they are on the model, but they’re still definitely not too short. The shirt’s length is also plenty to cover my waist easily. It’s a huge relief to the length I need without sizing up to get it.  On top of that, I get to shove my thumbs into the thumb-holes without feeling like I’m stretching the shirt out. Win!  It’s a fairly simple, plain long sleeve shirt, but it’s pretty, and it’s exactly what I wanted for my closet.  As an additional note, this is the 3rd Automet long-sleeved shirt for women I’ve reviewed, and I loved all 3. All of them had sleeves that were long enough, and the prices are very reasonable.
