Stacy Alexander,"Quality skirt for colder weather, but not quite as flattering as I’d hoped",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RW7VZQTP1S1NZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BCWZYRW7,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Wine,Verified Purchase,"I’m 5’ 5”, 145 lbs, and curvy, and I almost always wear a medium or sometimes even a large, but based on reviews, I sized down and ordered a small in this skirt and I was happy with that decision. I don’t like the boxy bell-type look with short skirts, and wanted it to be fitted without being too tight and this checked most of those boxes, but still wasn’t as flattering as I’d hoped it would be from all angles. It has a great thick outer material with a slip lining on the inside & a side zipper. Since I wore mine with tights, I did struggle with it slipping and rising up, so I had to pull it down after walking, but that’s the price I paid for getting a more fitted look. I’d recommend wearing a leotard-style top for a more tucked look, because my tucked in shirt under the skirt’s thicker material gave the illusion of extra belly that I don’t actually have from certain angles. Would still recommend!",

It still has the tag on the inside but it WREAKS of perfume and had white cat (maybe dog) hair all over it! Tbh i wouldn’t even care that much but the smell of the perfume is so horrible i can’t keep it. Yes i could wash it but why did i pay full price for an item that is second hand technically? And yes the other person could have tried it on and decided not to wear if but they definitely 100% doused it in horrible perfume first! Size was too but anyways, I am 5’4 and 178 pounds, i got the XL but definitely need to size down to a LARGE, i am curvier but it was still way too big at the waist. I could pull it off but it just doesn’t look fitting like i wanted so i will definitely be returning and i hope they don’t send it out again! The skirt itself is really cute tho, decent material and i like the length. There’s a zipper side closure, no stretch tho. It’s a wool blend. Has thin lining inside but the skirt itself is thinner too but the wool blend makes it feel thicker. I needed this for Christmas and it’s tomorrow but i will probably re order it in a smaller size of LARGE, because it’s still cute for the winter season! Its giving Abercrombie but without the little shorts, which would be nice. I’m giving three stars because i am angry it smells so bad and i know it was used. Do better amazon.",19
