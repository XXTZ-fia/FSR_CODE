alj5,Really nice light cardigan sweater,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23O6ESMSPC55K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07QF66388,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Size: 6XColor: Burgundy,Verified Purchase,"It is exactly what I was looking for. I bought the 6X. I usually wear a 30W/32W in plus size brands like Lane Bryant or Catherine’s, and it fits well. The shoulder seam actually sits at my shoulder instead of falling onto the arm because many manufacturers assume plus size women have insanely broad shoulders. The sleeves could be a hair longer to suit my preferences (I’m 5’8”) but it’s not so short that it looks funny. The color is on the darker range of burgundy.",
