Kelly Szalanski,What I was looking for!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTFZT2WMEI4Z6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0829R9M5G,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: Large LongColor: Dark Wash,Verified Purchase,"Purchased 3 different styles of Amazon essentials “jeggings” and these were kept after returning a XL long for a large long. XL created too much bag at my thighs and was a little too loose at top. I don’t have a large butt so finding the right fit around my thighs can be difficult when it comes to leggings.  The Large long hit me at the ankle with no ride up when sitting. The waist did not create a muffin because the elastic band wasn’t too tight and was pretty wide. Plus i think it helps to have no functioning pockets, zippers, etc. that create pouching in front.  The color was as described even though the fabric is lighter weight with more stretch like leggings…they looked like denim.  Happy with purchase. Hope this helps others!",
