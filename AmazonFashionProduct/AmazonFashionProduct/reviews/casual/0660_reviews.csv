The top is very much the same, it is small but feels a bit ""oversized"" in nature. It has a collared neckline which is nice for going out of the house in it, it gives more of a ""im not in sweat clothes"" type of feel. It has pockets on both sides but no back ones. The material is nice and thick and will not shrink or fade much when washed or dried.  The color is good but a bit of a faded black and nothing seems to stick to this material, as in liquid beads right off which is fantastic!! For me its just ok, remember order true to size if not a size smaller for a nicer fit.",10

Now originally I knew I could fit the bottoms better and not the top because I'm heavy but I know my mother could fit the top so we're trading off but I did try it on fully and it fits very well, it's perfect for fall and some chilly ❄ seasons and I love the pockets as well as the whole fit of the outfit itself because you can tell that the material was taken care of in the process, very hard to find the office like this and this will keep you good for at least three seasons out the year, very nice and stylish, we are loving it 😂, thank you!",

A total dream! I do feel for more versatility though, the top could’ve been a wee bit more whimsical in its engineering (shape)- because that would’ve given the wearer more style options & interchangeability for styling & fashion. Nonetheless, this is an incredible duo; the pants & shirt alike are buttery, velvety soft making for a cozy effortless look & feel you can dress up or keep as is. The pants do pay mind, are for me a perfect length (I’m 5’5)- my only stance here & not to be persnickety but I almost feel as though there are perhaps several elastic bands within the waist of the pants. And on the thick side- it’s a bit heavy while wearing but not uncomfortable ( I just felt it worthy to note in case that will make a difference in your mind on what size you wish to choose for yourself). These pants are on the forgiving side but I overall get the feel this is a style conceit for beautiful ladies of all sizes, but lends greatly to our sisters out there on the taller/slender side; I am no fashion expert but I am an average almost considered “short” gal so I am not particularly too keen on fashions that may make me look wider/squatty because trust me… I’ve been a victim in the fashion world to that lol. Ladies, you do what you makes you most comfortable & makes you feel cute - I have no doubts this is something anyone can wear with ease & SUPER CUTENESS!",

The flared legs and v-neck are the trendy flourishes needed to elevate this beyond the basic sweatpants and shirt. The drawstring is functional and the waist is very forgiving. This set is great for hanging out with friends or family and running errands.  This works well with casual glam accessories or minimalist looks.,

Top lays nicely and is very similar to the pictures in the listing. The pants are comfy, the fabric has very little give, so size accordingly. What's not so comfy is while the images on the pants show the waist at the model's waist - on me they are totaly Urkel pants - as in Steve Urkel. Not something I find very comfy and I'm not short waisted. If I put the waist band at my natural waist, the crotch of the pants hovers just about mid-thigh. The measurements in the listing are accurate for what I received. If the top were sold separately, I'd get it in another color. The pants will become true house lounge pants. Nice set, just not for me. However, this would absolutely not stop me from looking at Evaless products in the future - that's how much I like the top!",

The waist just fits, the remainder of the pants are large and flowy.  The waist is very high, coming up to within 2 inches of my bra.  The top fits perfect, but is not on the larger side.  I think that it's a nice contrast to the flowy bottoms, otherwise could have looked sloppy.  The coffee color was a bit lighter than I expected, more like a latte and is so pretty.  I have blond hair and light skin and it's very attractive against my coloring.  I'm happy with it.",

I was disappointed by this because that's not great--I wanted them to be much closer to the images. It's almost comical how wide these legs are--it makes the outfit look sloppy, unfortunately, so it's not the elevated look I would normally choose.",4

The brown is as portrayed on the website.  I like the color very much.  I am a 2x five foot five woman.  The bottoms absolutely swim on me.  The pants are very very wide and very long.  If I were to wear 5 inch heels the length would work.  The top on the other hand is great except a little tighter than I like through the middle.  I like the cut, though casual it looks less casual with the collar.  The fabric is not cotton and does not breath well.  So do not plan to do any exercise in this outfit.  This type of fabric knit tends to make me overheated.  The three stars are for the poor fit on the bottoms.  The rest is just personal preference.",
