Two things I didn't like.  First the inseam was off, too long. I fixed this by turning them from uncuffed pants to cuffed pants and now they really good. I think the inseam was off by one inch.  Second when you first put them on the buttons are really hard to get though the buttonholes, if you keep your wallet in your back pocket it is hard to open the back pocket.  So when the pants arrive put the buttons through the buttonholes a few times before you wear them, this will loosen them up.  Overall review: Not quite as good as a certain company whose initials are L.E., but half the price.",

And getting my keys out of my pocket means I inevitably pull my pocket inside out when they get stuck in that little pocket. Both of these things are infuriating.

It allows enough room for movement without feeling baggy. The fabric is soft against the skin, making it suitable for all-day wear, whether at the office or out for dinner.  **Wrinkle Resistance:** True to its name, this shirt is remarkably wrinkle-resistant. I often travel for work, and it's great to know that I can pull it out of my suitcase and look sharp without needing to iron. It maintains a crisp appearance throughout the day, even after sitting in meetings or commuting.  **Versatility:** This shirt is incredibly versatile and can be dressed up with slacks for formal occasions or paired with jeans for a more casual look. The variety of colors available also allows me to mix and match easily with different outfits.  **Quality:** I was pleasantly surprised by the quality for such an affordable price. The stitching is solid, and the buttons feel secure. It’s clear that this shirt is made to last, even with regular washing.  I highly recommend the Amazon Essentials Men's Classic-Fit Wrinkle-Resistant Dress Shirt to anyone looking for a reliable and stylish addition to their wardrobe.

Traditionally, when you order 38 x 32 pants, the pants are actually a 38 inch waist and 32 inches in length.  The waist seemed correct; however, the pants were more than 3 inches longer than they should be when compared to other 32 inch long pants.  Decided to return rather than spend more money having them hemmed.  Even though this is a defective product, I've just learned there is no longer a free option for me to make returns.  I can drive 30 minutes away, pay to have a label mailed to me, or print out a label and pack in a box at my expense.  I chose the latter, but my label didn't meet standards so I had to buy a label from the UPS store to get it mailed.  If Amazon is going to change the way they accept returns, they should let customers know so we can decide if we are going to roll the dice when purchasing their products.",2

I'm stuck at a 2.5 for them teetering been 2-3, i waited to received all 7 pairs i ordered(2,2,3) before reviewing as a pair in the second two had a missing button and I'm totally 3 different pairs had problems or defects some messed up sewing a couple broken or unconnected belt loops a front button that's near falling off.  I wish i could at least give 3 stars, if it has only been the one pair I'd have went with 4 stars and considered 5, the pants themselves are off good quality, the pairs fully made are a bit long but i expected that , pockets are small but bigger than you might think but that could be a deal breaker, over all though my experience is mixed i would say they could be with a try, if they improve quality control some these could be a solid 10 out of 10 every time in my opinion but currently it's a bit of a gamble.  (May lower or raise later after I've had some time to wear and test them more to see how comfortable and durable they are, but first impressions werent bad, just been cold weather)",
