The material is pretty thin so the wind will go straight through. I’d say they’re a bit tight in the butt snd thighs for me but I am a little curvier so i wasn’t too shocked. They have a nice high rise with a comfortable waist band. Id say it’s worth a buy to see how it works for your body type!",2
