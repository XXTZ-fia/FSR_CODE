In black, it's subtle but stands out enough to give the top some style. The loose fit is great for medium body types, but might be a little baggy if you're very thin.",

I got the green and really love the color. Unfortunately although I usually wear an xl this one is too big on me. So I would order a size smaller. I will use it as a gift for one of my friends. I would order again if I see it on vine.,

The neckline is really unique and isn't itchy like I was honestly expecting it to be.  The sleeves are the perfect ""oversized"" fit but aren't restricting in anyway.  It's long enough to wear tucked out or tucked in -- however you prefer to style your shirts.  Material quality is great and it fits true to size!",

It’s a sweet blouse, composed of a waffle knit combined with “lace” decoration on top.  I chose the Size Small navy blue model, and it fit well (5'8""/145/36B).  It will be an attractive and fashionable addition to a summer wardrobe.  In my case, the sleeveless nature of this blouse will be perfect for the desert setting when the temperature hits 110F next year.  It can be worn with jeans, dressier slacks, leggings, boho skirts, and capris. The fabrication is flawless. Finally, my laundering protocol will be cold/delicate/laundry bag/line- or hang-dry.",

I chose the green color, and it is a lovely, soft shade of green. The material is incredibly soft and feels light and airy against the skin. The top features beautiful trim along the neckline, adding a touch of contrast and elegance. The overall fit is quite roomy, so if you prefer a more fitted look, I would recommend sizing down. Overall, it is a gorgeous and well-fitting top that I look forward to wearing throughout the year. It is lightweight enough for summer but can easily be layered for cooler seasons.",5
kj,Love the blue color!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FHH5OOCJJ8BL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHKSYPWZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 9, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Blue,,"I like the flattering shape of this cute top - the shorter length, the straight cut of the hem, and the way the sleeves lay on the arms. I also love the deep, rich blue color. However, I was surprised to find that the design on the top is more see-through than it appears in the pictures, so I have to wear my shirt with a nude colored tank top in order to hide my bra straps. Most of the time this won't be a problem, except when it's too hot for an undershirt. As far as the fit, I ordered a size smaller than usual because of the measurements on the size chart and they turned out to be accurate. Overall, this is a pretty, feminine top for a very reasonable price.",

It's made of 67%polyester,  30% viscose, and 3% elastane, and made in China. With a price tag of $16.99 I would say it's well worth every cent! It is a relatively comfortable shirt (meaning, you don't really notice it on in any positive or negative way), and it has easy care instructions (machine wash and air dry). You can kind of see it in the picture, but it is slightly see-through, though not enough to be noticeable. The lace portion at the top is not too low, so it keeps your modesty. I really can't find anything bad with this shirt! It's well made, fits well, comfortable, and adorable! You can dress it up, or down. You can wear it in most occasions, anything from work, to a date. I want to get one in every color!",7

Their sizing chart is accurate, based on the size I got & how this top fit, which it was an accurate fit.  It is a loose fitting top, so the size large I chose does fit loose & is flattering.  I really like the fabric, as it's comfortable against my skin & the material is a bit stretchy too.  The only thing I wished was the scoop neck to be a bit lower & more giving, as there isn't any stretch to the neck area.  Aside from that, it's a very pretty lightweight top that could be worn to dress up or go casual.",

It makes my curves look smooth. The lacy bodice is suggestive but not revealing. The pattern draws attention away from my neck, which is not my best feature.

It is also easy fitting, with a relaxed fit. I ordered in large size, and it fits as expected, and I feel the size chart is correct. The design is pretty with the lace look of crochet on the neck area and shoulders. It is a breath of fresh air design on a relaxed fit top. The current price of $17 makes this a good value at Amazon.",
