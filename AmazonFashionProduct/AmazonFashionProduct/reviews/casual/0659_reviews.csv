Alena Cooper,Unique and Pretty!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LM82QP0VJK7F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5M34XFQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 24, 2024",Color: GreenSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"This is such a unique top! I love the texture and the material almost has a hint of shimmer so it feels both dressy/elegant and casually comfortable at the same time. The length is great to pair with jeans or a skirt and even though the material seems thinner it doesn’t show a bra or bra lines. It’s stretchy so could probably fit a wide variety of sizes. I’m smaller with a flat chest (30A-32AA) so it is just slightly big in the underarm area for me but not so much that it’ll show my bra or really gape. I’m used to size small being pretty big on me and usually have to return them but this one fits well enough that the unique style makes me not only keep it but purchase other colors. On me it isn’t super form fitting and I do like that because I feel like it makes it a bit more modest with a skirt and with jeans it dresses them up and looks classy but also flirty. I have not washed it yet but I think it’ll do ok especially with being hung to dry. All in all for the price I really recommend this top, it’s different and fun and I think it would look great on a wide variety of body types!",
