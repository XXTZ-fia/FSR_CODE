Alexis McGuire,The Perfect Versatile Shirt with Fun Flair,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTN5J3BWYEB2X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4ZLG9H6,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 28, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I recently purchased a shirt that has quickly become one of my favorites, and I just had to share my thoughts on it. This shirt features fun sleeves that add the perfect amount of flair without overwhelming the overall look. They strike an excellent balance between stylish and practical, making it a standout piece in my wardrobe.  One of the first things I noticed about this shirt is its lightweight fabric. While it’s thin, it doesn't feel flimsy or poorly made. In fact, it has a nice quality to it that suggests it will hold up well over time, even with regular wear. The fit is fantastic; it hugs my body in all the right places while still allowing enough room for comfort. Whether I’m dressing it down for a casual outing or dressing it up for a night out, it adapts beautifully to whatever style I’m going for.  What I love most about this shirt is its versatility. On a casual day, I can pair it with jeans and sneakers for a laid-back look, and it feels effortlessly chic. On the flip side, when I want to elevate my outfit for a more dressy occasion, I can easily tuck it into a skirt or dress pants, and it instantly transforms into a polished ensemble. This adaptability makes it a staple in my wardrobe, and I can already see it becoming my go-to top for various occasions.  In conclusion, this shirt is a delightful blend of style, quality, and versatility. With its fun sleeves, comfortable fit, and lightweight feel, it’s perfect for anyone looking to add a little flair to their outfits. Whether you’re aiming for casual or dressy, this shirt delivers on all fronts. Highly recommended!",13

I would definitely order another one, different color. Well made, not cheap.",2

Love the lace sleeves. At 5’8”, it is a good length right about hip level. The sleeves are a little short for my preference but not too short. Not super form fitting but also fits in a flattering way. It is lightweight and very comfortable. I was wearing this shirt out for a few hours, went to the bathroom and noticed a hole on the side seam! I usually inspect a shirt before I wear it but failed to do so with this one. Super disappointed because I know I did not cause this hole. I love the shirt so much that I wanted a replacement, so I was sent one. I inspected it and it seems to be flaw/hole free, so we shall see how it holds up! I got it on sale for 12 bucks so you may get what you pay for! I will update if shirt fails me again.",42

I also like the fit. The only reason it doesn't get five stars from me, is because the sleeves are a little short and I'm probably going to have to push them up and make them 3/4 length. I haven't washed it yet, so I'm not sure what it's washability is, but straight out of the package when I tried it on it felt nice. It's a little on the thin side, which I like being that I have hot flashes a lot. I also like the airflow I get from the sleeves. For reference, I am about 5'9"" and about 155 lbs. I purchased the medium, and it fits very nicely. It might be a little baggier than I expected, but I think it looks nice on me. Depending on how it washes, I might purchase another one in a different color.",52

I expected it to be a little more form fitting but it just isn’t. It basically hangs off of me. I normally wear an XL so that’s what I bought and it’s honestly too big for me. It’s very lightweight but is very nice looking if you dress it up. I just don’t feel the all around cut and fit of the shirt is great. I feel it runs large. It does wash fairly well with no washer wear if you wash it on the gentle cycle.,

The shirt is very stretchy and lightweight.  I would’ve liked for it to be a little bigger so it wouldn’t have shown me looking like a busted can of biscuits. 😝 No fault of the shirt, It’s just my body type.

The stitching across the top of the bodice is very attractive, and definitely takes the style up a notch or two.  The lacy sleeves are a really nice touch, and as a person who is usually warmer than everyone else in the room, they help me stay comfortable when the heat is blasting during the winter months.

Itchy/scratchy sleeves? The lacy fabric is soft. No irritation at all. The lace does continue to the neck, so a bra with nude straps is recommended. 2. High neckline feeling constrictive? Not at all. The neckline (like the rest of the shirt) is extremely soft. The neckline did not feel restrictive at all. Top is very comfortable and flattering. Living in Houston, TX, there are seasons & occasions that call for a long sleeve, but temperatures are still too warm for for long sleeves. Enter this top with lacy sleeves. I was not disappointed. I wasn’t cool by any means in late October, but I believe this top was more comfortable for 90-95 degree temps than a regular 3/4 or long sleeve option. It runs pretty true to size, but if you like a loose fit, size up. I like the detail stitching from the neck; I think it makes a flattering visual line. I’ve already bought two more in different colors, because autumn temps will still not arrive for at least a couple of months.",21
