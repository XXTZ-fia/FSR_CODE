Reviewers seemed to think they were really comfortable but I should have known better than to expect much at this price. I've since swapped out the soles for some Dr Scholls but even those have their own issues.  On the pro side, the shoe fits really well around the ankle, it looks really good, it breathes well- and after a month and a half it isn't falling apart just yet. So there's that! I get a lot of compliments on them.  I usually have trouble with shoe comfort, and I almost wish I could walk barefoot everywhere because that feels fine but the default sole in these caused pain in my arches where the Dr. Scholls don't. I'm going to have to shop around for some inlays that work better- but I wonder how much is the inlay and how much is the shoes design, with the Scholls, the ball of my foot near my pinky toe kind of gets sore and worn.  I also had to return the size I got originally because it was too small, and even with the size up I wonder if I should have went one size larger. The tags at the back bug me sometimes depending on the socks im wearing, wish those were less pressed up against my heel.",

I walk around a lot, and I have not had any back pain wearing these shoes for over four months now. In fact, it led me to purchase two more varieties so I can wear them more often.  That said, the pattern does make it difficult to clean sometimes, and they don't have amazing traction.

The material is thin and mesh though, so FORGET about wearing these outside while it’s raining unless you avoid every puddle and come to terms with having wet socks all day.  They were true to size, so I didn’t have to play the return game. The only complaint is that you will need to wear socks with these, preferably taller socks.
