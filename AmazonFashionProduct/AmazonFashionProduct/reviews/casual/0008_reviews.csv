They’re listed as 3/4 & in the pictures they look like full lantern sleeves, but in person they’re pretty short…above the elbow short. When worn it’s possible to make them look a bit longer by using the oversized fit of the bust but they shorten right up if you lift your arms or move in certain ways. Otherwise the top is exactly as pictured & really cute. The oversized fit is comfortable but not sloppy looking bc of the attention to the detail in the design.  I think the neckline & pleat in the front add style to something that may otherwise look sloppy & make it possible to dress it up or down easily. It’s made from a lightweight breezy material that reminds a lot of linen & like linen it doesn’t really have stretch to it, but the oversized fit more than makes up for the lack of stretch. The top is well made as I haven’t found any flaws or loose threads & is made by a company that tends to have nice & unique clothing. The sizing is spot on but if you want a less oversized fit I’d say to size down. I also find the price point to be fair & would definitely recommend this top.",
