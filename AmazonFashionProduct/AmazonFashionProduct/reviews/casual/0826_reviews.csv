The fabric is nice and soft, and it fits an American large. The only issue I have is that the buttons are somewhat difficult to button since the fabric is thick, so it's much easier to wear as a jacket than a dress shirt.

The burgundy color looks very nice. The size charts can sometimes be confusing. My normal size is XXL so that is what I purchased. This XXL shirt fit exactly as expected. The shirt is a very lightweight jacket or a very heavyweight shirt. It is particularly comfortable on cooler days that are still to warm for a real jacket. The shirt is heavyweight 100% cotton so it does wrinkle quite easily. Hanging it immediately after washing and drying helps a lot. I did find that the bottom hem rolled up a little and might need ironing to flatten it back out. Although the shirt doesn't require ironing I do think it would look best when ironed. The shirt is well made and should last a long time.,

It’s not for hot weather wear but ideal for those cool lakeside evenings. It is surprisingly versatile and it works as a shirt in cooler weather and as a light weight jacket for those times when it’s chilly. I found I really liked the ease of maintenance – I tossed the shacket into the washer, then ran it through the dryer and it came out without wrinkles or shrinkage. I wore it almost every day on a recent trip to Alaska – the weather was cool and rainy and this fit the bill perfectly. I wore it over a long sleeve T-shirt which gave me a style I like. I normally wear a medium (5’9”, 150 lbs) and the medium fits me perfectly. Highly recommended – I’m going to get more in other colors for the fall and winter in the lower 48.",

Straight out of the packaging, the first thing that I noticed about this shirt is its weight. I ordered size Large, and this shirt weighs over one pound — about 20 ounces. This fabric feels like a light, supple canvas. During cooler months of the year it could be layered over a t-shirt and serve to some extent as a windbreaker. For me it is too heavy for temps over 75, but it’s fine for temps in the 60’s.  I’m very pleased with the shirt’s color. I ordered it in “wine red,” and the color is rich, deep, and true to what I see on its Amazon page. I can’t speak to how well this color will age, but right out of the box it is gorgeous.  The only negative criticism I have is it doesn’t fit well, though to be honest, I did not expect it to fit my frame perfectly. I’m 6’4” but slender, so I wear a size Large. The XL would fit me around the chest and middle like a bathrobe. This size L is fine in the body, but, when I extend my arm as in the photo I’ve attached here, the shirt’s cuff rides half-way up my forearm. In addition to relatively short sleeves, the shirt isn’t quite long enough in the body to stay neatly tucked in to pants, but it is cut such that it looks good untucked.  With the cuffs rolled up and the shirt worn untucked, it’s a keeper for kicking around home or over a t-shirt for a hike. If the manufacturer will someday make sizes to fit tall folks, I'll certainly buy another.",6
