I wear them to work and the lightweight fabric definitely make a big difference, as I'm on my feet during shifts and don't need to carry extra weight. They keep me both warm in the winter and cool in the summertime. Makes them a versatile part of my wardrobe. I would recommend these because they are light, comfortable and fashion forward. They also have genuinely useful pockets, just don't load with them with too much or with anything too heavy. One good thing I must mention, though, is that they're versatile enough to wear to work or to a night out on the town. They're definitely worth the investment. I highly recommend them.",4
