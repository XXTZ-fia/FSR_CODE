Based on other reviews I sized up and probably shouldn’t have.  Here’s what I didn’t like: it leaves fuzz on your chair and the fabric balled up where anything touches or rubs. It’s a longer sweater so you can tell where you sit on it or where your lanyard rubs. Those areas are more worn after wearing it once. It’s not what I was expecting as far as fabric. It’s almost like a velvet kind of material on the raised portions. I don’t see this sweater lasting for the long haul, maybe one season at best.",
