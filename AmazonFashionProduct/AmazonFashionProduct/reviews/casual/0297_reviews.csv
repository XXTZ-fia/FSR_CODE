It's got the feel of a good long-sleeved t-shirt.  I typically wear an XL, or an XXL for a slightly oversized fit.  This shirt is bought an XL and it is a bit larger than most XLs.  It is a nice oversized fit though, and is comfy.  It is long enough in back to cover my tush.  I'd wear with leggings.  The quality seems ok.  The seams on the arms and sides are a bit odd, but not terrible.  The color is nice.  Matches how it looked online.",6

Amazing quality, style and fit. Absolutely love them. So comfy. I get more compliments on their clothing than anything I’ve ever worn. I do wait for sales as pricing is high, but worth it.

It looks lovely, soft and flowie. It is soft but not as flowie and has tattered edges, by design. I didn't notice that in the images. The top is light enough that she doesn't feel too hot, and the garment us very soft to the touch.  The seams are on the outside, not the inside which to me, takes away from the type of top it was meant to be. So on that note, I do not believe it is a great price for the item it actually is, IMHO",

I would like just a little more length on it. Anyone tall at all would probably find it a bit short.  Very comfy and cute overall with some tweaks.",5
