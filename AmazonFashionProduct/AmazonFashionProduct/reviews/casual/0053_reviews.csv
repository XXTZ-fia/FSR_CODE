Alexa bridges,The zipper is terrible.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNC533WYBZLD0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09DPGWGFZ,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,I almost love this hoodie… except the zipper catches and is difficult to zip up every time and there is a flap of unnecessary fabric on the inside with a surged edge that constantly flips outwards instead of staying in like it should.,
uncbrooke00,"Warm but only ""oversized"" in width",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12I4NTTIPU3OG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09DPGWGFZ,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,"It's super warm and comfy, but for a sweatshirt that claims to be ""oversized"", the sleeves are short and the overall length is short. Width qualifies as oversized, so the overall shape/fit is a bit odd. Also, if you don't have it zipped up, the odd bit of extra fabric on the inside (on both sides of the zipper) constantly gets in the way and/or turned inside out. I'm definitely glad I didn't pay full price, but I'll use it at my office when it gets chilly.",

KCole,"Very Thick - Think Coat, Not Hoodie",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E0K6TCAFH137/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09DPGWGFZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Nutmeg,Verified Purchase,"Very thick, very warm but feels like I'm wearing a coat, if I'm honest. Also, the sizing is a bit large. I normally wear an XL (to be comfy and not snug), but I could have gotten an L instead. If you need something to wear on cold days, this will do the job. You can layer it under a larger coat on really cold days, but if the temperature hovers around 50 or 60 degrees then THIS is your coat. Full stop. Also, I hear people comment on the zipper and they're not wrong, the zipper is a little difficult but after wearing it for awhile it seems to have become easier. I also hang it in the closet with the zipper all the way up, which helps.",

I actually started wearing the jacket towards the end of October, it is a very thick material for a hoodie , beautiful color, I loved it!

I’m past the return window according to what I read. So buyer beware, you may purchase a jacket that will fail a few months into its use and be stuck with something unwearable.",
