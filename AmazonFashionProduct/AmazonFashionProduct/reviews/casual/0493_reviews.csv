Trust me when I say that it’s so versatile! Throw it together with a pair of jeans, leggings, sweats and it dresses up your outfit! I ordered a large because I wanted it to be a bit roomy. The quality of the material is really really nice!! It’s a waffle design and not thin material. It wears nicely and hangs over areas that you might want to cover up. The sleeves have a little cap at the end so if you needed to pull them up, the will stay up. It’s really a darling top and I can’t say enough about it. I don’t put mine in the dryer but it’s a preferred choice. It’s somewhat a heavier lifting top, meaning…it’s not cheaply made which is why it feels a bit heavier material than others. I ordered the apricot which came in a more of a creamy look than what the photo shows. All in all, the top is good quality material and I love it and so will you!",8
