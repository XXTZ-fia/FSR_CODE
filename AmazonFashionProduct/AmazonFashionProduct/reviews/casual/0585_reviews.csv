It almost looks like a pajama top to me.",

It did not fit loose but more of a body skimming fit. I will pair it wish a cardigan or shacket. Great price for a basic wardrobe piece,

I’m 5’8”, 132 lbs., and typically wear a Medium. However, according to the size chart, the measurements on the medium seemed a bit small, so I opted for the large. It fits perfectly in the shoulders and bust area, but it’s a bit big through the waist and hips. It doesn’t look too baggy, just definitely a front tuck shirt. The color is gorgeous, and is heathered. It’s extremely soft and will be so comfy to wear. It’s a poly/rayon/spandex blend so it should wash well with minimal shrinkage. The length of 26” will be perfect to wear with leggings and the sleeves are plenty long for my long arms.  The lace is beautiful and is stretchy around the wrists, so I can push up my sleeves. The v-neck is perfect. The workmanship is excellent and I appreciate the lovely way it was packaged, without shrink wrap. This is really a pretty shirt, with the lace trim accenting an already great long sleeve top. Just be aware of the sizing..the medium would have been too small, and the large is just a tad big. Can’t wait to wear it.",

I ordered black, which online looks like a lighter heather black. In person this is straight up flat black, which loses some of the interest. The fit is also strange. It is supposed to be a loose fit. I ordered a size medium, which is normally a loose fit for me. The shirt is tighter in the bust and arms but loose everywhere else. If you are bigger busted or have any muscle in your arms, this isn't going to fit quite right.",2

The color is as it is in the advertisement.  There were no odd odors or discolorations to the shirt I received.  The lace gives it a cuteness and adds femininity to it.  The sleeves seem a little long but I think that's the lace and that the shirt is supposed to fit loose.  It's easy to fix the length so no big deal just felt it needed to be mentioned.  I really like that this shirt is casual but can be dressed up with the right accessories like a belt, maybe a silky scarf, or an antique looking brooch.  Overall very happy with this shirt that is comfortable and easy to wear in the fall and spring seasons.",
