Wilma H.,Be careful and stay on top of your orders,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AG3ULTWCXYYI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9KMDHZX,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 31, 2025",Color: Black FloralSize: Large,Verified Purchase,Material and fabric softness was right. Sleeves length was off a slightly compared to the other side. I liked the colors. Got email that said a few times that my order was being sent. Got another email that said delay in shipment so they weren’t going to charge until I got my order. I sent them email stating accordingly to my bank they already asked for their money without me getting merchandise. I know my bank very well and would take care of me. It was a little unprofessional to keep getting emails stating that I was getting delivered again only to get another one next saying delayed again . That’s why I only gave three stars on this shirt,

I think I would call it peach, rather than pink. It is a pretty top, with just a bit of detail at the top. It is long, which I do like for cooler weather. I would say it is less roomy in the midriff than some other shirts, but it is not fitted. It is a soft knit which I think will look good even after multiple washings.",

CONS: None at this time.",4

I typically buy a size or two larger than most normally would, simply because I like my tops to fit a bit more loosely. This blouse works great in the size that I ordered. The scooped hemline helps with the easier fit. The puff at the shoulder of the sleeves is small (thank goodness), so no worries about fashion ""donts"" with this one. I like the ribbed design on the front from the neckline. As soon as I tried it on, I thought how nice this blouse would be for any dressing up occasion. (Or dress up some jeans for a day of shopping.) I'm not a fan of the long, ruffled cuffs - they feel weird on my wrists and arms. They are not tight and restrictive but do seem tight enough that they will hold at the spot near my elbows where I inevitably manage to push all my long sleeves. Lol The material is lightweight and will be perfect once the temps finally cool down into Autumn.",2

It's a soft, comfortable cotton/polyester fabric with super cute detailing. I normally wear a medium and this fit me just as I would expect a medium to. It isn't really quite as long as most tunic tops, but the length is sufficient and it's got a relaxed flow. I have very tiny wrists so the cute elastic detailing at the wrists doesn't bother me, but I could see that possibly being tight, and maybe annoying or uncomfortable, if you have a larger wrist. It went through the wash great and I just hung it to dry, because there wasn't a wrinkle on it. It's a very cute print, really comfy, stylish, and a great value. Winner!",2

The tag says machine wash but then shows dry clean for best results. That is kind of a joke. I don't know anyone who would dry clean a $15 top like this. I washed and dried without any issue or shrinkage. I usually order large and large fit well. I don't care for the smocked sleeves but I may like them better as the weather is colder. I usually push up sleeves and these work well for that. One star off for lack of fabric ID.",3

I especially like the long sleeves with smocked cuff which ends just at my wrist. It is hard to find long sleeve tops where the sleeves are the right length, and I am glad these sleeves are perfect for me.  The tunic length is modest and the crew neck detailing with pleats adds a special touch. I also like the curved hemline.  The fabric is light and comfortable against the skin. It is slightly stretchy. I could not find any information on the exact fabric composition, either on the Amazon product page or product tag; this information would be really good and useful for customers to know.  The workmanship and finishing details on this garment are good. I'd recommend this tunic based on the quality and price.",
