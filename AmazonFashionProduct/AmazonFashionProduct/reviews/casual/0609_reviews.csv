We searched the entire package to see if it had fallen off in there. Nope, no button. Obviously your products are not quality inspected prior to shipping to a customer? Apparently they are not. Anyway, thankfully I was able to find a button on the iner shirt tag, and thankfully I know how to sew one on. There should be no reason for this. Otherwise.... The shirt is definitely not wrinkle free by any means, size is great, material thickness is normal to most dress shirts, casual. Warmth.. none. Comfort, TBD.
