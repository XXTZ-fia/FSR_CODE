I ordered a small and I weigh 140lbs and I’m 5’2 I would have liked it to be a little smaller. The fabric is also not what I was expecting and is a bit weird.  I will still wear it but definitely don’t love it as much as I thought I would.,

The shirt is oversized and comfortable, and the softness and drape of the fabric contributes to that. The ribbing gives it more visual texture and interest, and the color combination is nice and adds to the shirt’s versatility. I like the way it is pieced together—the darker blocks on the sides have a slimming effect, and who doesn’t want that? The fabric is a good weight, too—warm enough for cooler days but not so heavy that I’m melting if someone turns up the heat. Very happy with this shirt.",

Also love the button detail on the front. I decided on the Green color, but they do offer this shirt in a plethora of different colors and variations. In terms of maintenance and care, this can be machine washed. For reference, the material is made with 75% Polyester, 20% VIscose and 5% Elastane. Based on a positive experience wearing this sweater, I would recommend this to other consumers. :)",3

It fits pretty true to size, although the sleeves were quite long on me.  However, it just hung.  Despite the colors providing an illusion of shape, there was no shape.  It hung and was just... there.  Since I got an XL and it was a little long, the length just exacerbated the shapelessness.  I was hoping to wear loose over leggings, but I'm going to have to tuck this in to get any sort of shape out of it.",
