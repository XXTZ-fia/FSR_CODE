curmudgeon,"Classic and comfy, good value",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K1FKAYXRZ2ML/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHX8G1ZH,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Size: 10 ShortColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"These pants are SO good. I am trying to level up my style from mostly jeans or casual dresses. I have sensitive skin and tummy and am very picky about fabric, fit, construction. Have tried many, many brands and styles including flowy, full pants. These more structured trousers are actually just as comfy, and hold up in the wash. Light beige shows wrinkles a little more than the black and indigo, but not bad. Good for travel. Great price. Decent pocket depth. The belt loops are pretty wide, a 1"" belt looked too thin so I found 1.5 better. I am just super happy to have found these and now have a classy type of pants (3 colors) that I wear now 1 or 2 times per week.",

I have to dress like an adult but my work entails a lot of movement. THESE PANTS ARE THE BEST. They’re more comfortable than jeans, flattering (no muffin top, no butt-flattening), easy (normal wash and dry, sometimes even hang them up afterwards instead of leaving them in the basket; they’ll probably last longer if you treat them better). After A YEAR of wearing one pair 1-2 times per week and generally being tough on them, they’re still ready to go from my dryer (likely after two days of sitting there) to a meeting with heels and a tailored jacket to boots and a hoodie in the field, yet still be comfy enough for a tee and sneakers on the weekend.
