The material exceeded my expectations in terms of quality as it is soft and comfortable. It is formfitting (with long sleeves), but it isn't overly tight. I would say that the fit is true-to-size or that this runs slightly large. I would suggest sizing down if you're between sizes and would like this to be form-fitting.I ordered this in a small.

Most things these days are oversized or cropped. It’s one extreme to the other. This is perfectly in the middle. The material is soft and has the perfect amount of stretch. It has a nice fitted look without being too tight. It’s also true to size and washes/dries well. Quality matches the price point! I’d recommend to anyone in need!,

The quality, fit and material reminds me of what was worn back in the day",

I’m usually an extra small so I got this with the intention of shrinking it in the dryer lol, since it’s supposedly made out of cotton & spandex. It did shrink a little, which is great, but it’s still loose under my armpits. I feel that if I was an actual small, it would still be loose under my armpits…I deducted a star for that. I also feel like the shirt might have some polyester in it (even though the tag says cotton & spandex) because it’s rough even after washing & drying. I’m probably not going to be wearing this out in public because of the aforementioned loose fabric under the armpits, so will just wear around the house.",

Star Sweeper,"Soft, Pretty, But Size Chart Might be Off",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZK27KARH4IRW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8VZ2F59,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 22, 2024",Color: BluepinkSize: X-Large,,"This top has some good features, but it fell short for me in sizing and the fit. The fabric is a nice, lightweight blend that feels comfortable and breathes well, making it suitable for layering or wearing on its own. The colors are true to the online pictures. I love the pink and blue scheme.  However, the fit in the chest is quite off for me. It’s noticeably loose across the chest and armpits, which is unusual for a shirt that’s supposed to be fitted. It’s a shame because the overall design and quality are decent. I followed the size chart when ordering, but it may be the case that I need a smaller size. I’d recommend trying on more than one size and returning the one that doesn’t fit. You may need a size smaller than what’s written on the chart.",

The colors were nice, though I’d say the “pink” is more orange-y/peach than a true pink when it comes to the pink&blue shirt. I do like the texture of the shirt though. Very comfy to wear! It’s something different than all the neutrals I have in my closet. I also made the mistake of ordering a size larger, thinking it was super form fitting and it isn’t that kind of fit. I wish I would’ve gotten my true size (medium) vs the large that I got, BUT it still fits and looks nice. It just has more fabric in the underarm part of the shirt, but I can make it work. I do like that this shirt has more length than most these days and the sleeves were plenty long. All in all, a great fun add to my wardrobe!",5

I'm into stripes and Breton lately and I love this top. It's a nice weave that stretches but doesn't get all wonky after wearing it a day. I man, elbows aren't all baggy, stuff like that. It's breathable, which is great because it's long sleeved and I'm wearing this in summer. I've gotten compliments on it, too, which is nice. It's literally a long sleeve T, but it reads as elevated. Literally no price difference, but way better perception. Good investment in a wardrobe.",
