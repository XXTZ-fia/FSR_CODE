Pablo,Durable! Hard quality to find nowadays,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WINYHGU0YQH9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3Q34YKJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 25, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,"I've worn a variety of button-up shirts over the years, from Prada to Carhartt, for different occasions – from operas to blue-collar work. Let me tell you this right now: this shirt can work for just about any occasion.  What I love about it: the fit, feel, and durability. I lost a good amount of weight and needed to size down, I tried a few Amazon brands, and one black shirt really stood out. It's this model. I've had it for about a year, machine-washed and dried it regularly, and it still looks as good as new. I bought another one a couple months later. It's 100% cotton, which I love for its breathability, but it does wrinkle a bit. Usually it's a trade off in shirts, but again; AMAZING FEEL. It's fairly light so definitely layer up if it's cold; I wore a merino wool base layer underneath and holy guacamole was I comfortable! Although it is long sleeve, it might not keep you the warmest alone, but if you use it in the spring/summer, you're going to love it. When I used it for working on my dad's farm, I honestly didn't care about the wrinkles, but it was never terrible wrinkling. In fact, I got the sleeves hemmed and noticed the wringling on the sleeves is minimal compared to how it was prior, so be prepared to stop by the tailor if you're on the shorter side for that perfect fit (def worth it though). If you ever want to use it for an interview or something, this might not be ideal, but definitely can pass if you hang it in the shower to steam and can impress if you take the time to iron and starche it. I'm on the shorter side, so I usually rolled up the sleeves to avoid wrinkling prior to getting them altered.  I'm 5'6"", and am just got the sleeves hemmed. I love this shirt so much I bought multiple. So it'll be nice having more colors in my wardrobe that are good quality and fit well. I'm a fan of the pocket too, even though I don't use it much.  Now, here's the thing I don't like, and it's not what you'd expect. Have you ever heard of an expression, something along the lines of ""if you're not paying for it, someone else is"" in regards to fast fashion like Shein and such...It's the ethical aspect – I don't know who made this shirt or the conditions they worked in. I'm hoping the quality speaks for itself as this is far from the ""fast fashion"" quality you see in modern clothes nowadays. The price isn't terribly cheap...but still, it could be made by kids in the same environment as those old Nike documentaries. I've shifted to buying from countries where I know workers aren't exploited (such as in the USA or Japan). As one working man trying to build a better life for himself, I don't want to shop at the expense of someone else. I had a difficult time finding information, but I'm kind of in a tricky spot as I lost some weight and need something in my closet. But if you're looking for quality that lasts and looks good, this shirt delivers. Try one or two first, and if it feels great, go for it.  I'm graduating university soon and hope to make more money where I can buy stuff 100% ethically, so don't think I'll be buying this again unless they make it very transparent where it's coming from. But for interviews or hardworking days when you need something sturdy, I highly recommend this; nothing comes close to bang for buck. If I find out it's ethically made, this will be my first choice for life indefinitely. This is the type of standard quality clothes that were originally held to decades ago.  [update: all of my shirts say they're made in Vietnam. I feel it's a step above China and Bangladesh, and the fact that Amazon is putting its name on it, I'm hoping it's at least following stricter labor standards, as there are some good trends in Vietnam humanity speaking. Feel pretty good about buying from them :) Again, typically, I try to buy from the US or Japan, but since I'm on a budget, I am perfectly happy with this and can recommend it to anyone else! changing review to 5/5 stars!]",66
toys for thought,Good shirt for the price.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM1292J13K3PJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3Q34YKJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 16, 2024",Size: MediumColor: White,Verified Purchase,Got it for a great price.

Squirrel,"Very, very comfortable in hot weather",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39UVFTBYI9EPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3Q34YKJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 30, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Blue Gingham,Verified Purchase,"These shirts are high-quality, 100% cotton, made of a thin, but durable, poplin weave. If you want a super comfortable, soft, very breathable, durable, and classy shirt, this is it. But because it is a comfortable 100% cotton material it will wrinkle slightly after washing, but I think it looks kind of classy with a slight patina of wrinkles, unlike the scratchy, stiff, hot and stuffy feeling polyester shirts that don’t breathe but don’t need ironing. If you need a stiff, perfectly unwrinkled looking office shirt, you should probably buy something else that has a lot of uncomfortable polyester in it. This shirt could be worn in a formal office setting, but you may need to touch it up with an iron after each wash. I normally wear size large shirt, but since this is 100% cotton, I decided to get size extra large to allow for shrinkage for a fit, and I’m glad I did, but I have bought these shirts before in size large and they fit with a more tailored look, but I prefer a roomier fit. I have not used an electric clothes dryers on them, but instead, just hang them on a clothes hangar to save energy and prevent them from shrinking, just like I do with my Levi’s. Excellent shirt—I bought a half dozen of them already.",6

Some shirts if you hang it right after the dryer you don’t but not with this material. Also, a weird crease pops up after each wash in an odd spot, maybe end of material roll? I don’t wear it as much cause I don’t feel like ironing. Overall, shirt is ok. Cost is cheap and colors and patterns looks decent.",

I did, however, have the reverse problem. For me, the arms were too long. I normally wear a 15.5/32-33 shirt and medium shirts normally fit me just fine. For these shirts, though, the arms were more like a 34-35 so really too long on me.",2
