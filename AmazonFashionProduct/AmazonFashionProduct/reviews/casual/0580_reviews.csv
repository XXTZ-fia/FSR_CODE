This shirt is another awesome addition to their unique line of men's clothing. As a big fan of corduroy, I found this shirt quite appealing due to its design. Imagine a corduroy shirt, with the cords usually going in a vertical pattern. Now imagine that someone decided to also arrange the cords horizontally, creating a waffle-like pattern, and there's your shirt!  It's thick, but not oppressively so, and would be great as a ""shacket"" (shirt jacket, LOL), or as an extra layer (those in colder areas know what I mean, LOL).  Another great garment from Coofandy!",

The quality seems consistent, and they maintain a standard level of manufacturing. This “shacket” (I learned the term recently and yes, I like saying that) works very nicely. It is thicker than a standard shirt, serving as a light jacket while still being fashionable. Even in summer, whether on cooler evenings or in a freezing subway car, it comes to the rescue while still giving a playful summery vibe. The texture is waffle, which gives it substance and helps it maintain shape. However, you still need to iron it; it is not exactly wrinkle-free.  My main issue with it is the fabric: it wasn’t clear in the listing, and I could only see on the tag that it is 100% polyester. I personally prefer cotton, as it is more breathable and natural, but since I will be wearing this more as an outer layer rather than something directly against my skin, I’m okay with that. (However, it was listed on Amazon under the category of “Cotton” in the breadcrumbs, which was not accurate). The disappointing thing is, for something synthetic, I hoped it would come wrinkle-free out of the washing machine and after hanging it to dry, but it didn’t; it had some wrinkles that could use some ironing.  Other than that, I like the overall cut. You can use it as an open shacket or buttoned down like a thick shirt, and it works well either way. I wear medium, and this was supposedly my size, but it was a bit larger than expected. If you are of a slim build, I wonder if small would work better for you. In all cases, double-check the measurements. As a shacket, though, the size works since I will always wear something underneath it.  It comes in 15 different colors, so you are bound to find one that fits within your wardrobe. The price is about average, maybe even above average, since the same brand also offers shackets made out of cotton for the same price (besides discounts), so go figure! (www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4XZRD6Z)  It is a good item for your wardrobe, but I would have preferred it to be cotton since I’m not getting the edge of the synthetic as being wrinkle-free. 4 stars from me!",3

Just a little cotton in this fabric would have made it much more comfortable to wear in warmer climates, but even wearing it indoors in an air-conditioned house was warm. I'll put this to the back of my closet until winter :-).",5

Nizel A.,Superb waffle knit shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLQXLNIH139YM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXZDDT9,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 25, 2024",Color: BlackSize: XX-Large,,"A deep rich black compliments the perfect stitching of the waffle texture. It is a somewhat heavy shirt, but that is offset by the thin mesh of the fabric. If you hold it up to the light and look closely you can see through it. This makes it extremely breathable to the point where you can wear it in warmer weather. An overall great looking shirt that can pair with lots of items.",

The material of the shirt is thick and warm, and fits nicely over my shirt. It's like a corduroy material except instead of straight lines it has a tiled pattern to it. I think it looks great in the brown color I received, especially with a black shirt. Recommended.",

I wouldn’t have ordered this has the listing shown what this was made out of.  I can not recommend this product.,9
