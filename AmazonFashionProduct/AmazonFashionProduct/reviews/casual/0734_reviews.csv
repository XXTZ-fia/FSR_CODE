The navy fitted ribbed long sleeve shirt with ruffles at the shoulder is both chic and versatile, making it a fantastic update to the classic basic top. The standout feature is how the ruffles lay perfectly on the shoulders, adding a touch of elegance and interest without creating bulk. Instead of feeling frumpy, the ruffles provide a flattering frame for the shoulders and neckline, elevating the overall look. I opted to size up for a more relaxed fit and I am glad I did. The shirt maintains a fitted appearance while providing enough room to move comfortably. The ribbed texture adds an additional layer of sophistication, making it suitable for both casual and dressier occasions. The shirt would look great with a statement necklace and tailored trousers for a polished office look or with jeans for a laid-back weekend outing. The combination of style and comfort makes it a step up from a basic top. If you are looking to add some flair to your everyday wear, this shirt is a top recommendation. I can already tell I will be reaching for this often in the upcoming months.",15

The shoulder ruffles are the main event, and they do attract attention. The cut of the top is simple, like any long sleeve tee you have.  Except this is much more fitted. I am more of a XS, about 5' tall and 95 lbs. This top clings mightily. You can feel every percentage of spandex content, sucking the air out of you.

I chose the navy blue color shown in the product video, and it looks really nice. I've already paired it with dressy pants, jeans, and even under a jacket, and it worked well with each outfit, speaking to its versatility. One thing to note is that the sleeves in the first picture appear stiffer and more prominent than they actually are in real life. In actuality, the sleeves lay flatter like they do in the product video. I wish they had the more pronounced look shown in the advertised picture, but again, that's not the case, and the sleeve ruffles lay more flat over the shoulder. This is something to keep in mind if you were hoping for a more tapered and distinct shoulder look. Despite that, I recommend this top as a beautiful and versatile addition to your wardrobe.",8

Ordering up to medium did make the sleeves a little long for me. But that’s not really a problem for a casual top in the cooler months.    I decided to launder the blouse to get wrinkles out before wearing. The black blouse did well with no color loss. It washes and dries very well, with no ironing required. The instruction said lie flat to dry. Instead, I tossed the blouse in the dryer on low setting for several minutes to get the wrinkles out and hung it up to dry the rest of the way.  Great results with no wrinkles or shrinking.    This blouse is a good value for a casual comfy fitted long sleeve blouse.",15

The red trim against the navy blue is such a cute combo. The fabric is a nice medium weight with some stretch and it's not too long on my short frame. My only complaint is that the ruffled sleeves don't lie the same. The inside seams where they attach to the shirt are kind of wide. I noticed one was angled towards my neck and the other outward. When I flipped them to both lie the same way, it helped, but the sleeves still weren't fully symmetrical. Not sure most people would even notice, but I am crazy picky when it comes to fit. I am hoping it will resolve once washed. However, even if it doesn't, I will still wear this shirt because it's so cute.  For reference, I'm 5'3"", 135lbs, 32DD, 27"" waist, 39"" hips (hourglass). I normally wear a S or M in tops and a 6-8/M in bottoms. I ordered a small and it fits perfect. If you are between sizes, I recommend sizing down.",5
