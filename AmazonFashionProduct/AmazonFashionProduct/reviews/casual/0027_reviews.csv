Depending on your intended wear – dress or casual – and what you are comfortable wearing, you may need to touch it up with a light ironing.  The shirt comes out with some slight wrinkles.  I wear it without ironing, but I am wearing it for casual and the wrinkles are very slight.  If I were wearing it for dress, I’d probably touch it up with the iron.My main complaint with this shirt is it fits just a little tight around the chest/waist.
