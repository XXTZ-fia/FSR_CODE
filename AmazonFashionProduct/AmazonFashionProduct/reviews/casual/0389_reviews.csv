That Woman in the Forest,"Super comfortable, can shrink",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZIHV4CDXEXH4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYPS5XVY,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Wine Red,Verified Purchase,I bought these because of the great price and will be buying more because of the great fit and feel. I bought a large because I like my shirts baggy. I am 5 ft 7 and 129 lb. I use this underneath other shirts on a chilly winter day in Oregon and it feels so smooth against the skin and has just a little bit more warmth. I don't know if I'll actually use it by itself because it is a little revealing of my belly but as a first layer it is super comfortable and attractive. The neckline looks great under other sweaters or shirts. Definitely a great buy and fit. NOTE: I usually always wash in cool water and either hang dry or dry on cool setting. I unintentionally dried one on hot setting and it did shrink from large to a medium size. It still looks okay but I definitely like it baggier so I'm making sure not to dry on hot.,4

The color is solid black. The fabric is thin but not flimsy. I am usually a medium - 5’8” 150 lbs and the medium fits perfectly. It’s a straight fit - without a vest or half tuck it will be boxy. This was the fit I was looking for. The sleeves are a good length - down to the tops of my palms. Sleeves have good stretch for rolling up arms when warm. Buying in more colors.  I liked the black so much I ordered in white also. The white is a little see through, not too bad. Will be perfect for layering under a vest, which is what I was hoping for. I also like the length as it falls at my hips.",3

I usually wear a large or extra large. I wanted a loose fit for lounging around so ordered XL. The shirt fits more snugly than I wanted and isn’t as long as I like. The sleeve length is fine but my fit isn’t like what is shown in the photos. It’s a lightweight fabric so good for layering but not as warm as a sweatshirt. One shirt I ordered was the red purple and it’s more of a hot pink so exercise caution. Haven’t laundered yet but doubt I’ll put it in the dryer because if it shrinks I won’t be able to wear it. Probably won’t order more.,
