So I jumped on this one when I saw it. I normally wear a medium (140lbs, 39"" bust) and this fits accurately. The sleeves are long enough (I hate when sleeves are too short), and the length is good. It's not fitted at all, it's a bit wide, but the adequate length prevents it from looking boxy on me. For a more fitted look, I could maybe have sized down to a small, but then the length and sleeves would be too short. This is a very casual shirt. Not a fabric that can be dressed up and particularly soft. It's not rough or anything and is perfectly comfortable. Just not buttery soft (I'm setting expectations here, not complaining). But it's well made. I have no complaints about it. The color combo is my favorite thing, along with the contrasting collar and cuffs. Looks as advertised. I've ordered quite a bit from Anrabess and have been happy with every item so far.",
