It fit my lower half but not upper half well, but that is likely due to my own body shape. There was a lot of extra fabric around the armpit. Overall, I think it is a standard sweatshirt with cute details like the dark colored snaps and inside out stitching. I don’t think it’s worth keeping though, I will likely return.",
