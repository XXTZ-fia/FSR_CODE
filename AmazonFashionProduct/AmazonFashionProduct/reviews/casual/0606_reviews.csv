I've only work them 12 times since purchased and they didn't hold up. Kinda disappointed and hoping the other pairs don't occur as well.  Update*** Jun 14, 2024 I bought khaki, grey, and olive green colors. First thing I noticed is that the sizing for all are very different and do not fit well. Khaki 3xl runs smaller and tighter vs a 3xl black. Olive green 3xl is a correct size and fit. 3xl grey runs a bit long, like about 3 inches longer then the other joggers.  Jun 5, 2024 So the joggers are definitely a size up, I got a 3xl and it fits well. My only issue is the back of the pants by the butt beacsue it has more lenght or its just extra material. But its left over that is not sitting well with my butt that it just makes noises when you walk. However it is a bit loose at the bottom which is okay for me, but the thigh part is not so loose but is also not so snug. I am 6'2 so the length of the pants are okay with me. The joggers feel very cheap and the stitching is somewhat questionable. But they are doing well for the prise. I also purchased 3xl Tall but they where just to baggy for me that I returned them.",10
