The sleeves are purposefully cut long for comfort. The neckline is wide and definitely comfortable. The front pocket is a nice detail. The fit is loose so there is no need for sizing up.

The shirt features a crewneck, long sleeves, and a charming front bust patch pocket, along with dropped shoulders and a seam running down the back that adds a modern touch. The color purple is vibrant and beautiful, and the medium-thick fabric is not see-through. This is ideal for both warm spring days and cooler fall and winter.

The dropped shoulders, loose fit, and crewneck style make it perfect for casual outings or lounging at home. However, the fit runs larger than expected, so sizing down is recommended if you're between sizes.  While the top is stylish and the material soft, it's quite thin, making it less ideal for colder weather unless layered. Additionally, there are some quality concerns: the patch pocket is slightly crooked, the mid-back seam has raw edges that might fray over time, and the sleeves are baggy. The manufacturer's ""no tumble dry"" instruction seems impractical for a 100% cotton shirt, and the top is considered overpriced for what it offers, especially given these flaws.

There are some nice design details lie the inset rolled edge inset design down the back, the slightly puffy sleeves at the cuffs, the sturdy 2.75 inch cuffs, the front pocket with the rolled edge hem at the top, and the extra long length. All these details make this a big step up from a regular crew neck shirt. The quality of the shirt is excellent. The cotton is very soft and thick. All the seams are surged with tight even stitching. The crew neck is folded over fabric, not an inexpensive knit. The cuffs also are folded over fabric. These are nice detail touches. The bottom hem is double stitched. This top is definitely quality. Washing instructions say machine wash and hang to dry. I put mine in with my regular wash and then into the dryer. It shrank about half a size. With the oversized cut of this shirt, the shrinkage probably made it fit better for me. For reference , I’m 5’4” and 138 lbs. I didn’t iron the top. The photo is the unironed top straight from the dryer. It’s fine for casual wear around the house, grocery shopping, and running errands. If I want to wear it for work or going out to dinner, I would iron it for a more crisp, formal look. I like the extra length of this top as it will be great with leggings. This is so soft I know I’ll be wearing it a lot this fall. The only drawback I see is this is too bulky in the sleeves to fit well under a sweater. Knowing this is meant to be oversized, it’s a great top by itself. I’m really happy with it as part of my fall wardrobe.",3

The crewneck style is also quite flattering, and it is not too tight or too loose around the neck  While I love this top, I would say that it is not perfect. The fit runs a bit bigger than I expected, so I would recommend sizing down if you are between sizes. Additionally, the material is quite thin, so it may not provide enough warmth during the colder months. However, layering it with a jacket or sweater can solve this issue.  Overall, I would highly recommend this Women's Casual Fall Top to anyone looking for a comfortable and stylish top for the cooler months. Its soft material, dropped shoulder, and front pocket make it a great addition to any wardrobe. Despite its few shortcomings, it is still a solid 4-star product.",
Pamela Ballantyne,Nice Top - fun!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KOBTIJHJEXF1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7VXNHR3,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 29, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Red,,"This is a nice top, perfect for casual wear. I like the loose fit and the pocket. I ordered my usual size, and it's perfect.  I'm not crazy about the sewing details on the back, but I don't have to look at that when I wear it.  $26 is OK - maybe a little high for what you get, but not bad.",

Just Another Person,Good Quality Casual Crew,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8AIDYL8CGJI5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7VXNHR3,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 26, 2024",Size: MediumColor: White,,"I ordered a size down from what’s recommended in the sizing chart and it’s a good fit - still loose and slightly oversized, but very comfortable. A sewn block detail and vertical center seam on the back side along with a front patch pocket add interest and sets this crew apart from the average long sleeve crew. This shirt is a good, medium weight and a good length which falls to the top of my thighs. Overall an excellent, casual top with a relaxed fit which will be great for cool weather.",
