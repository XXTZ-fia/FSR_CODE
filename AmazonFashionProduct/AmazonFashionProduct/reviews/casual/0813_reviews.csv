Pirate,"Cute sweater, but it’s not a soft sweater",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Z1HRVT22ZINJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPSTJ5ZH,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 2, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Pink,,"Dokotoo Flowers Sweater is a pretty, fun sweater, but it is not soft.  I had a sweater that felt like this long ago and I found that I didn’t want to wear it.  It’s like it is made of hard, slightly rubbery feeling yarn, that will hurt your elbow and make an imprint of the weave pattern on your arm if you lean on your desk or a table.  I’m funny about sweaters feeling soft, snuggly and warm.  It is a thin sweater too.  I tried it on with a thin lavender t-shirt under it and the sweater is thin enough that the lavender t-shirt changed the color of the white flowers on the sweater.  It made them look dingy.I like the pink, it is a nice pink and the fit is nice and the flowers are a fun change up from a plain colored sweater.  The medium is about 23” across the bust, double for all the way around.  And the sweater is about 23” long from middle of back neckline to bottom.  The tag says it is 100% polyester.I’m not sure I will keep the sweater since I don’t care for the feel of the yarn. I wish it was made from a softer feeling yarn because it is cute.It is made to be a big loose sweater and will look best worn that way.",4
S.

The pink is has some depth and is a clear pink. The flower print is darling. The fabric has a nub in it that elevates the look. It's comfortable. It's warm without being too hot.  The length is a bit longer than I anticipated, the sleeves are very long - and I have quite long arms. The size is TTS. I got my usual medium, and even though I have some tummy, this still fits well without being tight at all.",
Linda R,Soft and comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15IV5L56MP1A1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPSTJ5ZH,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 27, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Grapefruit Orange,,"It is a little oversized for me, which is exactly how I like for my tops to fit. The best part is that I can push the sleeves up and they actually stay there until I push them down. I like wearing long sleeves but when it comes time to do some washing or cleaning, they need to be out of the way! Most of my other tops drop right back down as soon as I move. I like how the orange pops with the white flowers and the simplicity means I can wear this sweater with all kinds of bottoms, including patterned ones.",3
Tony and Melissa ATL,Cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34GYXLWAA72I1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPSTJ5ZH,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 27, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"So the positives of this sweater are that the pattern is striking and pretty, and that the cut hangs very nicely and flatteringly. I did not love that the solid black part was less solid black and more of a black that had white flecks in it. I think it would have been prettier if it were a starker contrast. The fabric itself was also much less soft than I was anticipating. It was definitely not scratchy or uncomfortable, but I was disappointed in how soft it was. It caught a little bit throughout the day, but never pulled out to make a terrible snag. I like this top, but I think that it could have been better.",
Barb Reinhold,Very pretty and comfortable to wear,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKYUGBVHOL6SB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPSTJ5ZH,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Sea Green,,"I really love this sweater. The floral pattern is reminiscent of fashions from my younger days in the 1970s but still appropriate for someone my current age. I debated whether or not to order it, fearing that it might look gaudy or unflattering with the flowers being comparatively large, but I needn’t have worried. The sweater I received is beautiful. It’s very well made and has a slightly nubby -  but soft - texture. This is a lightweight sweater that’s not meant to keep you warm. It’s lightweight and not at all bulky. It definitely has an oversize fit. I ordered my usual size and it fits exactly as I like  my sweaters to fit, which is to say loosely. It’s very comfortable and not at all scratchy.",

Keep in mind it’s very slightly see through, but I just wore a tank top underneath and it was fine. It has a slightly oversized fit, and the sleeves are just a tiny bit long on me, which I like. I love the print, and it’s a very bright color. My students loved it!",
S. J. (Arcelia),SO soft. New favorite.

But honestly the more I've continued to wear it, the more I don't want to leave anything under 5 stars.  Guys, it's SO soft. It keeps me warm. The sleeves are an adorable length that comes to my fingertips but also the wrists are tight *enough* to keep it from slipping down that far when I don't intend it to.  Buy it. F'real.",
Kim P,Very stylish,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SAPKBKESI6IC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPSTJ5ZH,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Grapefruit Orange,,"This sweater reminds me of the boutique name brands and are very similar in touch, feel, and design. This 100% polyester sweater is not as scratchy as the name brand one and is softer and more pleasing to the touch, I like the orange color and the large white floral pattern. The sweater has some good stretch to it, and seems true to size and even a tiny bit oversized due to that stretch. I am 201#, 38D bra, and wear size 14-16, and ordered a Large in this sweater, which is true to size. This is a great stylish sweater to wear year around. I did wash, dry this in the dryer and it did not shrink.",21

It has the trendy big flower pattern that we’re seeing everywhere. I love the oversize slouchy fit of it. I went with a size Large, the sleeves are long enough for me and the torso length is long enough for leggings or you can tuck the front into your jeans, and the best part is it is not too boxy. For reference I’m 5’10”, 135 lbs, 36D. This is not a heavy sweater so if you’re looking for warmth layer it under a vest or jacket. Overall cute piece, good value.",3
CJJponderings,"Beautifully textured, lightweight sweater",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FT72QIBQAS0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPSTJ5ZH,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Brown,,"It’s hard to tell from the online pictures but this sweater is made with a nubby yarn giving the blouse a beautiful texture.  Even though the yarn is nubby it’s still soft and I didn’t need a camisole between it and my skin.What really impressed me was how preciously the floral pattern lined up.  On both the front and back the first flower started right at the neckline, the side and underarm seams had the flowers lined up and perfectly sewn and then each sleeve had a flower centered just above each cuff in the front.  I don’t like it when a pattern looks askew and leaves the brain circling.  Instead the floral pattern on this blouse was very symmetrical, easy and calming to look at.I didn’t use the sizing chart to determine size since I prefer my clothing a little looser.  Instead I ordered my regular size, which is one size up from most charts, and the fit was exactly what I was looking for.  The blouse also washes up beautifully.  The blouse has a very casual fit with the drop shoulders and sleeves resulting in no binding across the back shoulders.The only confusion for me was the headline specifies the blouse is suitable for winter but down in the description it states it’s suitable for fall and spring.  This blouse is lightweight so for me it’s definitely for fall and spring.  If I want to wear during the summer it will be with liner type of shirt underneath.This is an easy wearing and easy care blouse.",3
raverson,A great casual sweater...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T6GACWZIWXGT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPSTJ5ZH,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Brown,,"I ordered this for the Mrs. to wear in the office. She loves the soft feel and natty texture of the sweater. The flower pattern give this sweater a cheerful look and are perfectly centered and symmetrical to the garment. Sizing runs true on this garment and a large was a perfect fit for her, without a bulky, oversized look. The material is a medium weight, so it can be worn in 3 seasons, with and without layering.",
Asteur,SUPER CUTE!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MKPUCHHCM79J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPSTJ5ZH,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Pink,,"Ordered this because I thought it was cute,  totally didn't need it but I wanted it. Was pleasantly surprise that it is a quality made item.  Material isn't super heavy, not sheer but I wouldn't choose it for its ability to keep me warm either.  Regardless though it's adorable.  No issues with any stitching and no frays.  I ordered a large thinking I could use it to be a bit oversized but I should have gotten a medium as it runs large. Overall though I love this sweater!!!Highly recommend.",
Sabreezy Aint Easy,Has an over-sized fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QO1K0DU3T1HI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPSTJ5ZH,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2024",,,"I am 5’3, 135 lbs and my measurements are 36D-27-36. I am wearing a size small in the picture so you can see it has an oversized fit. I would recommend that you order your normal size. Also, this sweater looks cropped in the picture but it isn’t. I tucked the front of the sweater into my bra because the material was thin enough to do so but it is long enough to hang over your belt. As I said earlier, the material is on the thinner side so this isn’t meant to keep you warm because I froze wearing it without a jacket. So layer it up. I really loved it and thought it was the perfect sweater for the Spring or even Valentine’s Day. It is well made and you can’t see through it at all. It was also very comfortable to wear. I would recommend it.",2
