Love the slight mock turtleneck, the fitted cuffs, and the overall cut and drape. I will definitely order more colors!  EDIT: I got two more a month later, also mediums. They're all slightly different sizing, so be aware. All three were washed, then air dried, so there might be inconsistencies. I still like these b/c the sweater is good quality, and warm. I'll probably still add one more color to the collection!",15
