I didn't zoom in enough on the photo.  For quite a while I couldn't figure out which way was supposed to be the right side.  For a while I thought it was put together incorrectly as some seams are finished seams and some are the finish that is usually inside the shirt.  I finally figured it out after going back to zoom into the photo.  I wouldn't have purchased it had I known this but I am not really disappointed now.  I wear it often but I am not sure what people think when they see me in it.  Some have to think I have it on inside out.  LOL,
