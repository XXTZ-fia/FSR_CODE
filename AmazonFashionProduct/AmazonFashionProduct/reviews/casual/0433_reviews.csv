I usually wear a size small, and these fit perfectly at the waist and hips without feeling too snug. They’re incredibly relaxing to wear, and the legs flow beautifully as you walk.  The pink color is lovely—feminine yet subtle enough to pair with a variety of tops. I love how flattering these pants are, combining style with comfort. The wide leg trend is perfectly captured in this design. I’m really happy to have added these to my wardrobe!",8
Vadersdad,Not sure about these pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIZRMG23SEV0U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBQ9K4NK,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Dark Blue,,"These pants are true to size and the style is cute. They are definitely not for winter, very light weight.  These have not been washed and dried yet so I cannot speak to the durability of them.",

They look dressy but they have an elastic waist band (no zippers but with the look of a zipper front).  Not bad to wear to work.  I was concerned about the ""waffle knit"" but it actually looks and feels quite nice.  The length is a bit long for my 5'3"" though.  However the small size fit well and true to size for me.",

I love the button detail in the front -- it's amazing how much a single button can change the look of pull-on pants. The waffle-texture fabric is lightweight, yet substantial enough to drape/fall well.  I'm 5' 4"", and the length comes almost to the floor.  Shorter women may find the length a problem, and taller women will have some wiggle room.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",
