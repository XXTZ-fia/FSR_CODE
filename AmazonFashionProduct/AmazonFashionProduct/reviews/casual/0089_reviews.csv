Joey Jett,"Good shirt for price, but thin and not soft",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DYOP403JSMUV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXWG187,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 13, 2024",Color: BeigeSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"The shirt looks and wears well. I was hoping  the shirt would be a little softer, but as the item description says it is almost completely polyester. I did not, however, expect it to be so thin. I suspect you would be able to see your chest through the shirt in certain lighting. Overall, I expected a cheap shirt so I am happy with the look of the shirt. I am glad the stitching was good and not falling apart as has been the case with some shirts off Amazon.",
