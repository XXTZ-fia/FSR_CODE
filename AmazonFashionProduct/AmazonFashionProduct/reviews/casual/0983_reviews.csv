(No holes, no fraying, no signs of elastic “stretch out”).  However there are two differences I immediately noticed. 1)These ride about 2 inches higher on the calf. Almost to the top quarter of it.  2)The elastic banding seems to be a wider area and is certainly much more aggressive/tighter.

William Stevens,"Good color options, OK socks, but really pointless plastic string packaging",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EH2QVT5HGLGW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YYY136C,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 13, 2022",Size: 7-12Color: Tan Solid,Verified Purchase,"The socks are OK, nice enough. They are a little rough. Marc Anthony brand is a bit softer--at least that is what my wife observed. For me, I don't care that much. The socks fit, are not too thick.  The packaging is a bit annoying, that super-thin piece of plastic poked through all the socks so tightly it is difficult to cut the plastic without damaging the sock.  Calvin Klein: why do you even need that plastic? It serves no good purpose. The refuse left after cutting is way too small to put in recycle with any expectation of it actually being seen and processed. It will end up being another piece of micro-plastic out there poisoning some seabed or lakebed. Really, just put a piece of cardboard or paper around the socks. I would have given 4 stars, but I deducted 1 for the really stupid packaging.",3
