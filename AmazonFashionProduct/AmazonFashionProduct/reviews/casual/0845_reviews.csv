I purchased three different colors. They look very nice on, drape well and the colors are good, but not a deep color. They are comfortable, the quality is good for casual wear, but the material is not my favorite blend. The material is thin, but not super thin--so not a hot garment--soft enough, but not cozy soft. The sizing and fit are good, but if you want a relaxed fit, size up. Moreover, the flared stitching on the chest and slightly puffed sleeve at the cuff is really complimentary. Nice. Lastly, I have warn and washed them without issues. They did not wrinkle, or shrink, nor did any quality stitching problems arise. I recommend these long sleeve shirts for casual wear. I hope I helped you in making your next casual, long sleeve shirt purchase. Happy shopping.",3
