I guess this is a matter of what you had before.  This belt replaces one I got at some mall store 25 years ago (and wore nearly every day since).  I measured the thickness of that belt at about 0.150"".  The Timberland belt is roughly 0.125"" (1/8"").  Seems a small difference but I can definitely feel the difference.  And let's face it, that's about 30% thicker.Also, the product image depicts a cast prong - the belt I got has a stamped prong.  Again, not a huge difference but the stamped prong is thinner and has sharper edges.  It doesn't have quite the quality feel of a cast part.  It also can cause issues if the sharper edges begin tearing into the leather.It's hard to tell but it does seem like full grain leather which should help with longevity - so that's nice.Overall, not too bad for the price but I'm not expecting 25 years out of it.",5
