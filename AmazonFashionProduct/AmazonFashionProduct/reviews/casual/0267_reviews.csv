They seem to stretch out a bit without retaining shape. But the white is not see-through at all, which is a huge plus for me. They’re very comfortable. I’m five months pregnant right now and they they’ve been growing with me really well, but I think that if I try to wear them post pregnancy, they may be too stretched out.  Overall, I think these are worth the money, but if you do want something that’s going to retain its shape and maybe do some compression, you may have to spend a little more money.",
