teacher,Like print fabric but solid color is different fabric,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19PG7LAXFS9JC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8KHP4ZV,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: Patterned-brown PrintedSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I love the style, weight, and of the prints; and ordered several.  I finally ordered one solid color (red).  The color is lovely but the Material really is different. Solid Color Shirts--60%Polyester,35%Rayon,5%Spandex  but the print and Floral Blouses--95%polyester 5%Spandex is Soft and breathable.  The red / solid fabric is too heavy for my preference but suitable for a cooler season, so I will keep it but NOT order any more solid colors.  Those who like the weight of the solid colors may not like the fabric of the prints.  All washed well and dried (low, still damp then hang to dry) without wrinkles. These will be my everyday tops for the next year.",7
