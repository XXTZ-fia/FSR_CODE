I originally bought this because the model wears it in a way that looks a little more styled than I received.  In fact, I am reviewing it because I wasn't sure it was the same shirt I thought I ordered.  It is.  The G Blue is a really pretty color on me (I am winter skin tone)  The fabric has a slightly distressed look to it to give it some ""style"" and make it feel less utilitarian.  But it's a long sleeved t-shirt.  It has a standard neckline, and I am slight in frame so I didn't have any issues with the sleeves being tight.  I thought it fit fine for me (5'1"", 120 lbs) but it is really a basic.  You can't really ""dress"" it up.  It just gives off a casual feel.  I will keep it because I got it for relatively cheap, but it's a really standard basic shape and cut.  A shirt for jeans, and that's okay.",
