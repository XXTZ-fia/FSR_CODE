It's been in my work rotation for the last three months and I really don't have any complaints, but I do want to flag a couple things about the fit/sizing. I went with my usual ""US size"" instead of following their 'body measurement' chart and am glad I did because it would have been too big if I trusted the body measurement chart instead of my usual size. If you have a similar disparity between the two, I'd size down. It's definitely a boxy cut-- wider shoulders, straight through the hips-- but it drapes nicely when open to still sort of acknowledge your curves. I'm a 32DD with wider hips and don't really like how this blazer looks on me when buttoned up. It fits, but it looses the flattering easy draping (if I'd sized up, it would just hang off me). I'm very happy to just wear it open. It gets 5 stars from me that way. If it pops up on sale, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another color.",

Do not iron this coat, steam it only! I purchased the royal blue and there was white marks on it, and I know that was from someone who tried to iron it and burnt it. The material does not withstand a basic iron. So I returned it for replacement to have one that is not damaged. I will keep in mind on how to care for it because it matches a pair of loafers that I bought and I have been having a hard time matching those loafers. It is a different type of blue kind of a turquoise royal blue, but matches perfectly to loafers so I’m keeping it.
