They're long enough, but I think if I ordered XXL they may fit better, but I think they'd be too long. The material is very thin and flimsy, though comfortable and soft. They're more casual pants then work or business pants unless your work setting is more casual where you can wear casual shoes. Unfortunately, I'll have to return them.",

I can wear it to work (McDonalds) which I love. The material is like that of leggings but it feels stronger, not sure how to describe it. They feel like they will last a long time. Definitely longer than jeans with me (I get the dreaded threads that pop out and eventually thin out the material because I have big thighs) jeans last about 2-3 months for me. These will probably last a year or two if treated well  Edit: if they rub against metal they will fuzz up and eventually fray, the metal was not even sharp. Still really comfy though",10

However, these pants are much more casual than the description suggests, and I wouldn’t wear them to work. The pictures make the fabric seem thicker, but in reality, they’re more like thin yoga or exercise pants. Also, the buttons are purely decorative—they don’t actually fasten. You just pull the pants on. That said, the material is very soft, comfortable, and has a nice stretch. For $14.99, I would recommend them, just be aware that they’re quite thin and very casual.",26
