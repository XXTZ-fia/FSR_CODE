They are EXACTLY what I was hoping for- I bought 6 with the intent to buy more in other colors. The only issue I have, as others have commented. . . .it runs large. Very large.  I am 5'6"" and 198lbs, and bought these shirts because they are cute, but they don't necessarily scream juniors or young adult. I am currently losing weight so I bought these as an inspiration  garment- I can't wear them until I lose weight and fit into them.  Wrong!! I fit into a medium, and the medium is on the large side of medium. ALL my current clothes are xl, so I thought medium would be about right. I think the future sizes I will purchase will be xs or small. I will decide that when I lose weight and see what I think, then.",
Amazon Customer,Teenage Daughter LOVES This Sweater,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R592BO5OJY3HQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CFLTLR5T,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Color: A-blue GreenSize: Large,Verified Purchase,Bought this for my teenage daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves the softness of this sweater and we were slightly concerned that it wouldn't work for her because she has tactile issues... It was a hit. We will likely buy more in the different colors and probably a size down because she has a petite frame even though she likes the looseness.  I think it will still be to her satisfaction a size smaller. It is great quality too.,

It's very soft but in the way stretchy athletic wear feels (synthetic). Yet I think it'll still be warm enough for indoors in poorly insulated old buildings during great lakes winters.  Cons: I know it's meant to be oversized, but it still feels a little too big, especially in the arms. It's a (very) dropped shoulder. I got the 2x based on my size chart and I'm usually a 2x/US size 20 and probably could've gotten an XL. I think if I tuck the band at the bottom into jeans it'll be more flattering. The colors are also off. I got the pink/blue/yellowish colorway. In the pictures, the sleeves look like a golden, slightly muted yellow. In reality they are darker and more of a tan or camel color. The pink is also a hotter pink that leans more. But in the pictures it looks like a softer pink that leans a little purple. The colors are still fun and work together but I was initially disappointed. It's growing on me.  All that said I like it, and I'll probably order another color way or the short sleeve version in a different color.",13
