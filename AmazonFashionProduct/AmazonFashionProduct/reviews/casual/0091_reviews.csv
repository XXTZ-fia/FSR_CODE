It is labeled a ""Pullover T-Shirt"" by the seller, but in my opinion this shirt has almost no relation to any t-shirt I have ever owned. It is shockingly heavier than expected. This heaviness feels rather weird at first because to the eyes the fabric looks thinner, as if it should feel lighter when worn. In this regard, it feels more like a heavy sweater than a light t-shirt. It is also quite warm after wearing for only a few minutes. This shirt would be much better worn during a rather cool or cold evening.  Sizing is larger than expected. I've been wearing a size medium in shirts lately, but this medium feels like a large on me. The seller says this shirt is a ""stretch textured knit,"" and I believe that to be true, but since it's larger than expected there is no need for it to stretch on me. I would have preferred a smaller fit. In a similar vein, the tail extends a little lower than I would like, making this feel oversized.
