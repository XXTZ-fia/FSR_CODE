The one negative I found is that the sleeves are just hemmed; they do not have the snug ribbed cuffs that many other long sleeve tees have (that's why I gave it a 4-star).",

I gave it to my taller buddy and ordered a small. The sleeves and torso length are now perfect, but the chest and shoulders are way too tight. For reference I am 5’8”, 170 lbs (172cm, 77kg). I don’t know who designed the pattern for these shirts but it must have been their first attempt. It’s a shame too, because the fabric is nice and soft and a little heavier than a tshirt. I would have enjoyed wearing this if they had the dimensions correct. I will be returning the small I just ordered.
