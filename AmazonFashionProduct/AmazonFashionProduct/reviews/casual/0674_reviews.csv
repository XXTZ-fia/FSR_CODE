The draped neckline is beautiful and very flattering. I've worn this with jeans and with nice wide leg pants and it goes well with both being able to be dressed up and down equally well. I only wish the fabric was a little higher quality. It's a bit hard to describe, but the crepe chiffon fabric that this is made of, is very inexpensive quality. It's the same kind of chiffon that tops at Walmart and other low-end stores would carry. On the one hand, the price of this top makes this understandable. On the other hand, I'd have happily paid a little more for a more tightly woven crepe chiffon. I ordered this in black, so the difference isn't as apparent as it probably would be in other colors. If ordering this in black, you can get away with it - - - especially if wearing it at night in dimmer lighting. When I wore this with jeans during the day, I was bothered by it more because the natural lighting really called attention to the cheaper fabric quality. When I wore this to dinner with my wide leg pants, it was barely noticeable - - - and probably by only me because I was aware of it. If you are ordering this in other colors and thinking of wearing it in a professional office setting workplace, I'd think twice.",3

I will say the style may not compliment every body type so don't go by height/weight of others. If you have a wide waist you may find it snug. The length just about sits at the waist so you can't pull it down if you wanted more coverage for your lower half. On the flip side if you are on the small chested skinny side you may not like how it hangs because your body type alters the look of the style. It will wrinkle so wash on delicate with Woolite and always hang.,4
