However, I decided to up by sleeping comfort game by trying to find something softer and stretchy. You never know if a company’s view of “super soft” is going to align with your view, but these hit the mark. They are buttery soft, and if you slapped an Athleta or Lululemon label on them, I would have believed it; they’re so comfortable and high-quality. They’re tagless, lightweight, and with a smooth, stretchy waistband. I think science will have to develop a totally new material for me to ever switch to different PJ bottoms.",
