The fabric of this shirt is very soft and thick and fits well. I normally wear a size small and am a 32D and the small that I ordered fits perfectly! There is a good amount of stretch but it really forms to your body and disguises any lumps or bumps. It's also thick enough to be worn with or without a bra - without a bra it isn't see-through, but if you do wear a bra it doesn't show any bra lines!  I'm planning to order more of these tops in the future. They are such good quality, much better than the more expensive alternatives on the market. This is much better than a dupe of any of those brands! I highly recommend these shirts, they can be worn day-to-day and while going out!",

I'm 5'7"" and 130lbs and I got a small, and it's pretty snug; I use it as a shell. (It looks exactly like it does in the pictures.) My only complaint would be that there's no tag, so for a while, every time I put the shirt on, I had a 50/50 chance of putting it on backwards. However, if you hold it up to see where the collar lines up, the back is higher than the front, so it just takes a bit of eyeballing. Overall, it's a really great shirt and I'd highly recommend.",6
