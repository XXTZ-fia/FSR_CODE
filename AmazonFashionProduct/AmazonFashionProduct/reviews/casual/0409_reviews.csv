I am a size S on my lower body and XS on my upper body (5’7” and 125 lbs), so the dress size S fit about as I expected sadly - really flattering from the waist down, but a little too wide through the chest and shoulders, and the sleeves looked a little oversized on my arms. I also really wanted cotton, but for some reason all the Amazon retailers only use synthetic fabrics. This was about half rayon which I didn’t realize - I usually avoid rayon since it doesn’t wash or wear well. The dress didn’t look cheap or poor quality from the initial try-on, but I’m not sure how it would’ve held up long-term had I not decided to return it. Price-wise, it’s ok; I did get it marked down, but probably wouldn’t have paid full price considering the materials. That said, it’s designed and cut well, so I think it’s a decent value if you’re not able to invest in something more substantial and need something quick.",
