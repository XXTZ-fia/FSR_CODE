I purchased them hoping they would look like the picture. They did not on me. I am 5”7 so maybe the pants did not fit on me as it would someone that is shorter. I don’t know whether to say, go ahead and buy them or not, but I don’t feel they were a waste of my money. They just did not meet my expectation based off of the picture. I will continue to wear them because they are comfy. I just think the versatility of dressing it up and dressing it down isn’t there. Also, if you are my height or taller, they may not fall below your ankles. In addition, if you are plus size that may make them  stop at the ankles too.",4
