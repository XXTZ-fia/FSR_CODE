I haven't looked into the clothing type, but it feels like there's spandex (which I normally like) because if I bend over to pick something up, I have to pull it back down over my jeans and pull the sleeves back down to my wrists. I hate constantly adjusting my tops. I'm glad I waited and didn't order this in every color, as many other customers said they had done. I'm not as impressed as the other reviews stated.",

I did get a size medium because I was concerned about it being one of those shirts that ends up super tight and thus uncomfortable, however, I found out that I didn’t really need to size up because these shirts run very true to size so I probably would’ve been quite happy with a size small. As you can see, the medium is just a little big on me, but I really don’t mind it that much.  For reference, I am 5 foot five, 128 pounds and 34D – 28–38. And I’ve gained quite a bit of weight over the past year as I’ve gone through cancer treatment so it’s been a little confusing trying to figure out what size clothes are fitting me right now while I’m trying to get back into shape. So when I do get back down to my usual size of 110 pounds and I am more like a 32 DD – 25–34 this shirt may be a bit baggy on me at that point. But hopefully that should give you some idea when choosing a size for yourself.  I do have quite a few of these shirts in different colors, but of similar style, and I would say this is probably one of my favorites because the fabric of it is really soft and light and pleasant, but obviously a little see-through as you can probably tell in the photos and the fabric is also quite thin. You can even see the mole I have in the middle of my belly very clearly, lol. So you may want to wear a bra that has a little bit of density to it so to speak, unless you’re going for that 90’s “FRIENDS” look, haha!  But the shirt just feels so nice on the skin and I love where the buttons are and how far they unbutton so that they aren’t exposing too much but you can also make the shirt modest and you can tuck it in or leave it out, it has a great neck line, I love that the sleeves are a little longer and come down onto my hands a bit which I’m always a fan of because it just looks more stylish than if they cut off right at the wrist. And I really like the fact that you get a choice of so many different colors, and the color I chose I find particularly flattering. I’m definitely happy with it!  And perhaps, when I lose some weight, I might be able to shrink this just a little bit? Or it might still look nice with it being slightly baggy. Either way, I think this is going to be one of my number one go to comfy shirts that still looks attractive. I’m always an enormous fan of being both very comfortable yet looking great, stylish, and put together at the same time! Nothing better.  Totally worth it and I’d absolutely recommend it, and again I don’t say that much. I’m a tough critic, ha ha!  I do hope this review was helpful and you have a fabulous day!",5
