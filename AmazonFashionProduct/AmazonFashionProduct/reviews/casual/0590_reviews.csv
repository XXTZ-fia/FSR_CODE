I bought the XL Tall size shirts.  The first thing I do before trying on a shirt or purchasing them in a store is measure-I carry a tape measure when shopping.  I need a shirt with a length from the bottom of the collar (hem) to the center of the tail to be at least 35 inches...most ""true"" tall size shirts are 35-1/2 to 36 which is typically 3"" longer than the standard sizes.  These measure 33-1/2"".  I'm 6'-5"" with extra long torso and when I tried the shirt on and raised my arms, it popped out from the tuck on both sides.  I don't know what the length of their standard size measures but if they are shorter than the tall sizes they may be too short for taller men who can usually wear standard size.  It seems that a lot of shirt makers are following this trend in the last couple of years but my height has not followed the same trend!  Further, the overall weight of the shirts is very light...probably OK as a dressier casual shirt but not for actual dress situations.  I cannot recommend these for business attire.""",
