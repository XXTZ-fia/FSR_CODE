I got the size S and was happy I did so because my bust is only size B bra cup and a larger size dress I probably would not fill out the bodice cups sufficiently, but in the size small everything fit well across my smaller size bust without being too tight on my chest.  The A-line skirt is simply wonderfully comfortable, floating away and creating a very flattering look.  I'm very pleased!",
