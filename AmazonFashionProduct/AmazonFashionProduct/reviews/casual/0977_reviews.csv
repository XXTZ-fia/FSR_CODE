Slightly thicker but not overly sporty/casual. I have longer legs but wear these higher waisted and they hold my pooch in and camouflage it. I generally wear them with a basic black bodysuit, a fitted crop top, or a boxy tee. I get compliments every time I wear them. They’re comfort and casual but elevated. I do feel they are a little longer length. I’ve worn them with simple casual sneakers and also platform rubber sandals and the bottoms aren’t worn or ragged. The front seam draws your eyes up and down which I love. And the pockets are deep and functional. They wash so nicely and have absolutely been a staple for the transition of fall to winter but I’m naturally cold-so I anticipate these to be great year round!",

Wide-legged like *real* palazzo pants, they can easily be worn outside the home, and not just as uber-casual wear for quick trips to the store...they actually look like they can be dressed up significantly.  I'm 5'10"", and these pool slightly on the tops of my feet, when standing with no shoes on. Perfect length for my height, especially when wearing footwear. And because I order up one size, and the style, cut and fabric are so forgiving, I got the loose drape like the model is wearing.

They're comfortable for lounging, but still stylish for wearing around. Really cute wide legs and I love that it looks like there's a pleat down the front center. The pockets and the drawstring are great as well.  Got these in black, but really considering getting the gray and maybe others. These are so cute.  Hope this was helpful.",

A little shorter than I was hoping but great for lounge wear in the cooler days and months. Super soft and comfy material.  Has pockets. I really love the thick band as that prevents rolling and digging. Would love these in other colors. Great to wear casually or can be dressed up with a tunic. I love the versatility. The color is exactly as described in the listing.,7
