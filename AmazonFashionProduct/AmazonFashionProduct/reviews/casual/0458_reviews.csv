Unfortunately, I just placed two separate orders for their long sleeve untuckit shirts and both came to me a different color than was advertised on the website. This made me disappointed since all my previous orders came in correctly to the color exactly as the site presented. I have one more shirt coming in and I hope this one will match the site more correctly. The good news is that the shirts are made very well, colors(when correct to the website) are very contemporary, they fit great to size and are very comfortable. I expect to continue purchasing more merchandise from this supplier.",

It went through the washer/dryer cycles fine. No shrinkage or deformation. It is not wrinkle-free. Even using the permanent press setting on the dryer it still required a steam iron to get the wrinkles out. (see picture of shirt hanging for after dryer, before iron) There was a stain on the sleeve of the shirt when I opened the package. It did not come out in the wash. I don't know what it was, but it looks like an ink or wine blotch or something. I am not a fan of this shirt untucked. It doesn't have the side slits I like to see for a shirt that was meant to be untucked. It does look nice tucked in. However, it wasn't meant to be worn with a tie. The collar is not wide enough in the back. The sizing is a little odd. The shoulders are narrower than normal in proportion to the chest. My dress shirts are 44"" chest, 20"" shoulder, 25.25"" sleeve. The advertised sizes for this shirt are: Medium is 44.9"" chest, 18.9"" shoulder, 25.6"" sleeve. Large is 47.9"" chest, 19.6"" shoulder, 26"" sleeve. I ordered large because I was worried about the narrow shoulder measurements. The shoulder on the Large is still less than my other dress shirts, but if I went larger I knew the shirt would be way too big in the other measurements. As it is, the large is very relaxed in the chest and the sleeves are pretty long. I don't know if I should've done with the Medium or not.",

And he normally wears a 2XL and that is what I ordered in this dress shirt and I could have ordered and XL and it would have fit him much better. So, you may want to go down a size. This dress shirt is made out of high quality material and the stitching is on par. This shirt is pretty soft but it is the kind of shirt that I would not use fabric softener on due to the possibility it may stain the fabric.
