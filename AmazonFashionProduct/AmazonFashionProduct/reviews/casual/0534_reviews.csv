One- black, one black islet, one white with flowers.  All 3 were size medium (I am 5'6'' 155)  They were all very different fabric.  The islet fit best, but is intended to be a cover up, (which I neglected to read before purchasing) so I returned it.  The white was thinnest and lightest fabric, which was not great when wearing anything underneath as it's see through.  The black had just one pocket and only on the left- which was unusual.  It also had the thickest fabric.  It was more like a heavy tshirt so it doesn't lay the same as the other two fabrics.  It does hide the lumps and bumps, but I'm a little concerned about how it will wash.  Overall- the syle is great, and fits well under the armpits so no peak a boo bra.",

The neckline is different enough that it loses the little bit of sundress-type strap feel, and the stress goes pretty straight down like an oversized tshirt as opposed to a dress that swings when you walk. Additionally, the material is not soft, it has a very tshirt feel to it. It's an OK dress for what it is, but it's a big disappointment compared to the way it is advertised, and as I don't find the shape flattering, I would not order this dress again.",

The material is a stretchy jersey type fabric, i think it's a poly/rayon blend, but it feels like cotton. It's rather thin and breathes well, making it a great dress for summer and the beach especially. The fit is true to size and the cut is slightly generous, so it's a great choice for any body type. Stitching is fine, seams are even and there are no flaws i can see. My only complaint is the dress is a lot shorter than pictured. I get it, we all don't have the same body types-- proportions are different and all that-- but this dress comes up pretty high on my thigh and my body isn't THAT different than the model's. I wound up having to add a little bit of fabric to the shoulder straps to lower the dress a bit.
