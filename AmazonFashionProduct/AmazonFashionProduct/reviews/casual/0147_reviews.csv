It feels incredibly cheap. So cheap I didn’t even mess with trying it on. It has a cute look, but the holes are so large you’d have to wear something under it. The pink was vibrant and fun, I just couldn’t deal with the cheap feeling and knowing I’d have to wear a shirt under this. Immediately returned.",3

Kindle Customer,Warm Fall-Winter Sweater,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OUHWNDG24SWG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GS24BP,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 25, 2024",Color: Bright GreenSize: Small,,"Even with all the holes, this is quite warm. That being said, the holes are a lot more like a sweater mesh than how it appears on the model. You will be able to see what is worn underneath. I like the style and coloring, it looks flattering on. It fits true to size although I have longer arms and find that the sleeves fall a smidge short and hit at about the wrist area. It is a little longer like lower hip length. It's not overly tight or loose. The ""green"" color is more of a blue, like pictured.",
Deborah C.,Nice sweater.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FLBIYJA8N8IM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GS24BP,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 22, 2024",Color: Navy BlueSize: Small,,"This is a very nice sweater. It looks pretty close to the pictures. I will have to wear some underneath which I normally would anyway. I am petite, 5' maybe 98lbs and I would say this is a generous small. Not cropped or short in any way it is definitely generous in the length and arm width. It is acrylic and feels acrylic,  however it is soft. The color is not a dark navy. The first two picture are accurate of the color. It probably won't be my favorite sweater but I will get wear out of it. I steamed it and that worked pretty good to remove the wrinkles from shipping.",4
T. D. Green,Pretty sweater for Fall,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R397PJPTBTFD5K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GS24BP,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 18, 2024",Color: Bright GreenSize: XX-Large,,This is a really pretty sweater with a cute design. It's a lighter weight sweater that fits a wee bit snug for my taste. I ordered a size up and it's perfect. The length of the sweater and the sleeves are both right on. (I'm 5'9.) You will definitely want to wear a cami under this as the design is see through.,
Edmhutch,Cute - lovely blue,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1T9FEYSXMVXYR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GS24BP,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 14, 2024",Color: Navy BlueSize: XX-Large,,"I like this sweater a lot.  It fits well, be mindful that you will need to wear a cami or light t-shirt underneath since the dot pattern runs throughout the item.  Another reviewer noted how long the item is, but I didn't find it excessively long.  It is definitely not cropped, which I appreciate!",2
Vine voice from Florida,Pretty color and design,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ISNO8JTUGZAA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GS24BP,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 13, 2024",Color: ApricotSize: Medium,,"The sweater is a pretty colour and design, and is true to size.

FN,"Cute sweater, but it is acrylic!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GQICFJATN7VD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GS24BP,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 13, 2024",,,"For anyone wondering about the material used to make this sweater it is 100% acrylic.  I was truly hoping it would be more of a cotton or wool mix, unfortunately, the product description doesn’t mention the fabric type so I took a leap of faith.  I’m not a huge fan of sweaters made of acrylic, this one is no exception.  The sweater is lightweight and doesn't have that cozy feeling like wool or cotton.  Like most acrylic garments it does have loose fuzz.  It isn’t overly stretchy which is nice.  I ordered the pink in a size small and it fits really well, true fit (I am a size 6).  The pink is definitely louder than the pink in the photos, really bright.  The pattern is cute, I like the square boxes accented by vertical & horizontal see through lines.  It is a sweater that will layer nicely with a collared shirt. It is very comfortable, and even though it is acrylic, the sweater is soft.  It does make a nice everyday casual garment if you don’t mind acrylic, at a nice price too!",7
Rebecca,Too long,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1538YVVVCJHUR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GS24BP,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 12, 2024",Color: Navy BlueSize: Small,,"The only unexpected thing about this thin sweater is that it’s exceptionally long in the body. So much so that I’m going to have to wear it much differently than I had anticipated. Otherwise, it’s exactly as pictured and is a very nice style with a little hole details.",
