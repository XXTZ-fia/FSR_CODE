Very soft and comfortable. I hope it shrinks a bit as the sleeves are very long -- and I have long arms. Otherwise fits as I would expect a US XL to.

Noagenda,Sizing conundrum,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TLPO4FD8YWIN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3Q6D9LP,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Based on other reviewers, the sizing is a puzzle. I generally wear an XL in shirts that are S, M, L, XL, XXL and so on. As others will appreciate, when purchasing generic sized garments, you know you may have to buy a size larger due to inconsistencies of how these are measured and also, how much 100% cotton may shrink.  I purchased an XXL and the sleeves are 38"" long before washing/drying. The torso is huge but oddly, the garment is short. On the plus side, the cotton is very soft and thinner than most T shirts. Bottom line, it will likely end up being a sleeping shirt but for the price, my expectations were low.  FYI I am  6'3"""", 200lb, and stuck forever trying on L, XL, and XXL depending on the garment. :-)",

This works for me, I roll up the sleeves anyway, this allows one additional roll. As the pics clearly represent, this shirt has no cuffs. Which is what I prefer (again cause I roll up the sleeves). I washed the first one two times since purchase, and did not notice any shrinking, or very minimal perhaps. However, I never completely dry the shirts, I leave them just slightly damp and hang to finish drying. If you dry it to death in the machine, I would imagine it will shrink, it is cotton after all.",6
