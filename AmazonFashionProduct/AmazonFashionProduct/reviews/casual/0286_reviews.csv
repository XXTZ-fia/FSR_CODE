My name is Catherine Calamary,3-pack wide leg pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1T9TBKRWUF9U9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D496NMK4,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025","Size: MediumColor: Black,navy Blue,dark Grey",Verified Purchase,"The pants were very nice….quality, color, material…..and the price was great! It took too long to receive them, and that was disappointing!!  The other disappointing factor is that they did not come in petite length (shorter). I knew this when I ordered them, but thought perhaps they might still work……but when I tried them on, they were about 4 inches too long, and not being a good enough seamstress, I was not able to alter them.  I can’t blame the vendor for this, because I knew they were not petite length when I ordered them……so, my review is probably a suggestion; it would be great to offer this bargain for us “shorties”…..these bargains never seem to come in petite length.  One bright side is that I was able to “gift” them to the mother of a friend who is taller than I…..she loves them!!",

I had no idea what to expect, but this was going to be delivered quickly so worth a try. The pants are very stretchy and I have no trouble getting them over my cast. I put on the light/tan colored pair after they were delivered; I wouldn’t wear these out of the house because the fabric is so thin you see everything. Even the pockets on the front, which are nice to have, are very visible as you wear the pants, at least for me. This problem may not be as severe with the darker colors.Also, there is a very narrow band of elastic at the top of the high waist. It’s just tight enough on me that if I left it where it normally falls, it might become uncomfortable after a while because it’s so narrow. But since I’ll be wearing them at home and don’t care what the waist looks like, I folded the elastic down and it didn’t bother me. Overall, pretty comfy and very economical, given my specific needs right now. If I hadn’t had this cast, I would probably return them or just wear them at home.",5

That being said, heads up, I am 4’11” and 140ish (a little thick for my height). These pants at a large size has an inseam of 31” and I need a 28-29. I believe this cut would be ideal for individuals 5’1”-5’-8” and not petite individuals under 5’. Fortunately, (like every short person I know) I have a seamstress that will alleviate this issue.
