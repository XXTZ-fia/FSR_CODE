And most yoga pants make that apparent. I dare say, not these!!  These pants hug the booty, and then drape gracefully from there, giving a more professional, mature feel. Plays down wide hips that are accentuated in most yoga pants.  I am very picky about waistbands. I can’t stand when they cut into my stomach. These do not do that. It’s very comfortable and smoothing. The back, however, has a stiff elastic in the waistband, preventing them from slipping down when doing a squat. (Elastic is 1/2” wide and terminates at side seams.) No elastic band in front.  While looking so classy, these have GREAT flexibility, so no resistance or slipping down as you move into melasana squat, tree pose, or crow pose.  I am about 5’5” and 120-130lbs. I got a small, with a 29” inseam. The back of the waistband is snug, and the length is as short as I would buy. They almost touch the ground when barefoot.  The material is so soft, and somewhere between thick and thin. Flattering yet hopefully will be alright for outdoor practice in India…  Seams are of good quality. *Doesn’t give a frontal wedgie!! Hallelujah!* Green color is accurate.  I am returning every other yoga pants I tried (I’m picky), but I am keeping these. <3  May get a second pair… May try a medium.",9
