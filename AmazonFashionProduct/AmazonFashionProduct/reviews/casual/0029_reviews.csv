I am going to buy another one.  It washes great and is pretty much wrinkle free after washing.  My only comment is that the sleeves are very long.  I am a pretty tall person so they recommended size XL for size 12.  I wear a 14 so I ordered XL and it fit perfectly with the exception of extra long sleeves.  I can roll them up so I'm fine with it but just thought I would share in case this would be an issue for someone else.,2

I actually picked it out for a gift from my daughter. I was concerned about the sleeves in the picture and I still have a little concern. I plan to have a seamstress take in the sleeves. The wrist is boxy looking. I love the neckline.  I'm 5 ft 6"" and 162#. It long enough to cover my misaligned hips and waist due to scoliosis. I think it would be a little more attractive a tad longer with a curve instead of straight.  It's a perfect casual/dressy shirt. I don't think it's too thick material...not too thin either. It possiblely will wrinkle easy. It is very wrinkled just out of the package.  Edited review: after I wrote this review, I saw photos and I realized that my blouse is not the same on the bottom hem. My hem is sewn straight across, VERY BOXY instead of a nice curve as shown in the photos on here. Also the length isn't as long as the photos show. This is a nice looking blouse except for the unattractive hem.  Unfortunately, I washed it already as it was very wrinkled when I received it. Slight wash and drying caused the heavy wrinkles to smoothe out. It washed nicely.  Since I washed it already, I won't be able to return ot exchange it, nfortunately.",

It's soft because of the silky nature of the fabric (rayon blend, I think) which has a stiff, cheap kind of feel. It's a blouse so there's no stretch in the fabric but I don't know if you need it because it's pretty boxy.  It looks like it's made okay. However, the sleeves' cuff is quite wide with one button. Because of the cuff's circumference it almost covered my hands but then again I am only 5 ft tall: kind of petite. It's not the kind of fabric you could push up the sleeves and they would stay. It's extremely boxy. I have no idea how the photo of the model turned out so nice. Having said all that, it would probably look good under a suit jacket. Mostly because of the fabric . And since it is all a matter of personal taste, others might like it. I just sent it back. Oh colors are okay. I ordered small and it's white with a blue stripe",

I’m 5’3 and busty and typically have good luck with blouses at Express or Nordstrom Rack but was limited with time so Amazons quick delivery came through! I used a steamer to get rid of the wrinkles worked perfectly.,20
