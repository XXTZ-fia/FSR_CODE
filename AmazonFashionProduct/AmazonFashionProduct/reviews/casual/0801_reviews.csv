Annie,Love these!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVUB1X6I9U7JP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKQNT5WR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025","Fit Type: 29"" InseamSize: MediumColor: Black",Verified Purchase,These pants are so comfy and look stylish. I’m postpartum and this is perfect paired with the cropped sweatshirt. I feel comfortable but still put together. I got a medium 29 inseam and I’m 5’7 and about 127 lbs,
Maddy G,Absolutely recommend buying BUT just be warned…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QOOGBHJ8IQHQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKQNT5WR,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025","Fit Type: 31"" InseamSize: X-SmallColor: Dark Sage",Verified Purchase,"I absolutely LOVE these pants and already have bought them in two different colors because I liked them so much!!! The fit is super flattering and comfortable, especially as a girl of 5’8 who struggles to find pants that are actually long enough (I’m normally size S but ordered XS w/31” inseam). That being said, I still feel like it’s important to note a few things.  As some other reviews mention, the material is incredibly soft and nicely weighted, but unfortunately it also stains/shows stains VERY easily. The colors I purchased (sage green & nutria) are kind of lighter and faded looking to begin with, which I like, but maybe that contributes to the heavy showing of stains? Either way it’s definitely an annoying part of these pants because I’m always slightly worried about ruining them. The other thing I don’t love is that even though the material feels luxurious and high-end, it’s doesn’t seem super durable as it’s prone to snagging.  Overall, despite some annoying issues, I would still highly recommend because they are cute, versatile, fit nicely, and I like the feel of them.",

I would love to find a pair of pants in this fabric that actually fit me.  The inseam was 27"" which is what I ordered, so that wasn't the issue. They just didn't work at all with my body type. I carry my weight around the middle and am slimmer through the hips and thighs, and currently have a bit of extra belly weight. Unfortunately the extra fabric around my hips bunched up and looked like a pouch. Had to return them, sadly.  Also, when this says wide legs the bottom of the leg is much wider than it appears in the photo, which is not a good look for a petite. But the fabric, it's sooo velvety and soft and amazing. I was obsessively searching every pant style this company offers in hopes of finding a pair that would work for me. : ( The lady at the UPS store event commented on the softness of the fabric when I returned them.",

From the moment I slipped them on, I was impressed by how incredibly comfortable they are. The fabric is luxuriously soft against the skin, making them perfect for all-day wear whether I'm lounging at home, running errands, or heading out for a casual dinner.  One of the standout features of these pants is their wrinkle-resistant quality. I often find myself in situations where I need to pack light or travel, and these pants have proven to be a game-changer. Even after being folded in my suitcase, they come out looking fresh and ready to wear—no ironing required! This is a huge plus for anyone who wants to maintain a polished look without the hassle of constant upkeep.  The fit is another highlight. The wide leg design is not only stylish but also flattering, providing a relaxed silhouette that accommodates all body types.",3

My other problem was with the color.  The black looked faded although they weren’t.  It was just the color of the material.  You wouldn’t be able to wear it with something black. It’s noticeable (shown in the last photo).The thing that I did like about these pants was the material.  So soft and comfortable. They draped well and just overall very flattering.

Rich and opaque, but not bulky. Almost velvety and is somewhat textured depending on direction of nap. Style: Wide legs are chic. Pleated front provides a classy and classic look. Size: Purchased XL, which is mostly true to size. Seat not too tight or baggy. Seat and legs lay nicely. No bulging or riding up. Buyer is 5.5 1/2, and 29"" inseam hits slightly below ankle. Inseam length works well with shoes that are 2 inch or less  CONS Material: Legs are flowy. However, waist is made from a different type of material than the legs and has no give. Color: The navy is more like a dusty slate. It DID NOT appear as a deep, nautical navy as it looked on a few computers I viewed it on. Size: Purchased XL. Waist is a little smaller than other XL-sized pants that I've purchased from Asian companies on Amazon or in large U.S. department stores. Tight waist sizing is attributable to the inflexibility of the material at the waist.",8
