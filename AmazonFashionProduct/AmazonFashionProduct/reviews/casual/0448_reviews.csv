Mikaela Laughlin,"Cozy, Stylish, and Affordable – Love It!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLWH8LRKUONY7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHY49T4G,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Size: SmallColor: A Gray,Verified Purchase,"This oversized sweatshirt is everything I was looking for! It’s super comfortable with a great loose fit that’s flattering and easy to wear. The material thickness is perfect – it keeps me warm without feeling too heavy, and the fabric is incredibly soft.  I’ve washed it multiple times, and it still looks brand new – no shrinking or peeling, which speaks to the seam quality and overall durability. Washes well! The colors are beautiful, and it pairs well with just about anything. It honestly looks like a dupe of a more expensive brand but at a fraction of the cost, making it an amazing value for the money.  This has quickly become my go-to sweatshirt for lounging, errands, and casual outings. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for style, comfort, and quality without breaking the bank!",2
Cara,Perfect Fit and Super Comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BE65HKKRQK5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHY49T4G,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 8, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: A Gray,Verified Purchase,"This top is comfortable, stylish, and exactly what I was looking for.  Pros:  Perfect Fit for My Frame: As someone who’s 190 pounds, I often struggle to find sweatshirts that fit just right—oversized but not too big. This one has the perfect balance of being loose and comfortable without feeling like I’m swimming in it. The fit is flattering and cozy.  Stylish Look: The oversized style and the buttoned hood add a nice touch to the sweatshirt. I get compliments every time I wear it! Plus its a great price.  Super Comfortable: The material is soft and feels cozy against the skin, making it perfect for cooler days. The long sleeves and hood are just the right length, and it provides a lot of warmth without being too heavy.  Versatile: I’ve worn it with jeans, leggings, and even skirts, and it works with almost any casual outfit.  Cons:  None: Honestly, I don’t have any major complaints about this sweatshirt. It’s exactly what I wanted, and I’m happy with the purchase! I even had 2 friends buy one after seeing me wear it.",29
