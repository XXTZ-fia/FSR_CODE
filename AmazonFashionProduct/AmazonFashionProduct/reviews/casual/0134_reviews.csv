Hope it holds up over time. Good stitching (no stray threads). Overall seems to be a good value. In the past, I usually get the other Amazon Essentials wrinkle resistant chinos which feel a little “thicker” more substantial material wise (and are less expensive than these stretch fabric ones). These feel a little more “synthetic” due to the stretch material but are very comfortable. The other chinos have a center crease (which I usually iron out with some effort as chinos are meant to be casual pants and creased pants are meant to be a little dressier), these stretch chinos do not and so are a little more casual. I wear the creased chinos (the non-stretch ones) when I go more “business” casual, and will use the non-creased stretch ones for “very” casual wear. Even though these were stretch (so it was “OK”) the waist ran about 1/2” smaller on these compared to the non-stretch Amazon chinos it have. Again, good value (not quite the quality of other Gap etc slightly higher end brands, but also basically at only about 60% the price). Will buy again if they hold up well.",

Back when skinny jeans were in fashion, I tried on a pair and since it took too long to put on and take off, I never got into ""skinny"" fit pants. Well, I saw Amazon Essentials has skinny fit casual chinos and decided to get them since the slim fit were bigger than I expected. The skinny fit are perfect. Not baggy and a slight taper down the pant leg. If you're deciding on these slim fit chinos, I recommend you also pick up skinny fit chinos, see which one you like better, and return the one you don't like.

I ordered two in khaki, two in grey, and two in olive, all in the same length, and no two pairs of these pants were remotely the same size. In some cases, when laid flat, there would be a full two inches of extra fabric in the waist between two identical sizes.

I returned that set and ordered another, and the new set had the same problem, except this time one pair had two different length legs.
