What I Liked: The dress has the perfect length and strikes a great balance between simple and elegant. It’s incredibly comfortable and fits true to size, which is always a plus. I especially love the unique tie shoulder detail—it adds a fun touch! The color looks amazing with a summer tan, making it a great choice for sunny days. Plus, it’s versatile enough to wear for multiple occasions; you can easily dress it up with accessories or keep it casual for a day out.  What I Disliked: Honestly, I can’t think of any major downsides. The only thing to note is that the ruffle tier can add a bit of volume, so it might not suit everyone’s style.  Overall, I highly recommend this dress for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable option!",2

This dress seemed perfect. Unfortunately, it’s strange. The chest doesn’t lay right and gaps open in awkward spots. I have tried turning it around and wearing it both ways, tying and re-tying the shoulders to fit different, nothing makes it work. I wear a 36D and I’m wondering if a smaller chested woman would have better luck with the fit. Sometimes bigger isn’t better 😂 The fabric is good, nice that there’s a lining, and feels quality. Just beware if you have a bosom, this probably isn’t the dress for you.",

I feel like that's good enough of a review but I'll list out more reasons I love this dress:  Pros: - Lightweight and perfect for hot days - Can dress this up or down depending on occasion - Straps are thick enough and back is high enough that you can wear a normal bra without it showing - it's cute - quality is great. Again, it held up to Disney World and multiple wearings afterwards  Cons: - Some people have mentioned the straps but like.... tie them before you put the dress on, its not that hard - I think it ran a little big but as it's meant to be flowy, it's not really a bad thing - yes it wrinkles but it's viscose and if you let it sit in the dryer a day after it's done drying, of course it's going to wrinkle - It's currently $41 which I think is a bit high but since it's viscose and not polyester, that's forgivable  I'm going to hope the price drops a bit and when it does, I'll be getting another one",5
