BUT…. After one wear last night there were some spots / stains. I used stain remover and a toothbrush to scrub them and washed. Stains still are there. I spot treated again and going to wash again. Hope they come out with 2nd treating. My lululemon top just like this never has issues getting stains out….. Update! Stains came out after spot treating again and leaving it in for 10 mins before washing!,
