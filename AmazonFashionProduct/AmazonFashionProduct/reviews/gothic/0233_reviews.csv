Familyofsix,Worth the extra cost!  Great quality!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRXH20LMJBMQF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C629XVYK,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 16, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"We started with a similar but brighter red coat from Amazon.  When it arrived, despite having a 4.2 rating, it was poorly constructed, low quality material and looked like it would probably rip apart.  We returned it and bit the bullet for this, more expensive coat.  TOTALLY worth it!!!This coat is MUCH nicer than the similar one that costs $15 less.  The zipper works well, the sewing is much better.  The decoration on the front is completely sewn around and looks sturdy.  The material doesnt look cheap.  This is a coat that will last multiple halloweens.  It runs a bit small in the chest and plenty long in the arms.  My daughter who normally wears a S/M got a large and it fits perfect (I wish it were a bit more loose for layers).  Very happy with our purchase.",3

Kim,Low quality but cute for one time use,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TAUHBPRMOLB5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C629XVYK,"3.0 "," the United States "," April 14, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Red,Verified Purchase,The lace up holes on the back are barely attached. My daughter tried it on when she got it and 3 of them ripped with just a normal pull - definitely not tightly pulled like a corset. It's a low quality velvet type material. We ordered a size up - the arms were too long and the rest was a little loose but I wouldn't want to stress the fabric.,3

Nancy Smith,"Nice quality, good price",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWQGYWC4IHX6Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C629XVYK,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 3, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"This is a very nice, velvet jacket. I am 5’9” 190 lbs and normally wear a size 12 or XL. I needed an XXL because it was tight through the bust but you can cinch the jacket in the back for a nice fit.",8
Linda Porter,Love it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Y1R1Q00800Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C629XVYK,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 14, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Red,Verified Purchase,This is exactly what I wanted and it fits perfect.  Huge thumbs up!,
Kindle Customer,Cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3J5CGV3BPFZHJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C629XVYK,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 22, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I got this for my daughter who wanted to wear to a renaissance fair. She loved it and it fit well and the material was really nice. For the price it was really worth buying it and live that we can cinch it up in the back with the laces. Looks great, feels great and all around is a great tail coat for the price.",4
Faegrl,Fits well.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17WUNBF4S9I4A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C629XVYK,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 8, 2023",,Verified Purchase,A little better than expected. Seems sturdy. The back winches up for a better fit.,3
ALLISON G.,Steampunk Tailcoat,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJMAR4348Z12P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C629XVYK,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 13, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Red,Verified Purchase,Unfortunately it's on the small size. Even though I went up a size it's still too small. Other than that I can wear it open which defeats the purpose I got it for. Everything else is good as far as the material and style. So go up a couple size if you're in the 40 + bust range.,6
