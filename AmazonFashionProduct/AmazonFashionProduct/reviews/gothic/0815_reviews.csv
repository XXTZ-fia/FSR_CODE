Auch durch Waschen bei 40°C blieben die unerwünschten Falten bestehen. Bevor ich die Bluse anprobieren konnte, musste ich sie tatsächlich erst bügeln, was sehr viel Mühe kostete, denn die vielen Rüschen mussten alle glatt gebügelt werden. Erst dann konnte man sehen, wie der Sitz der Bluse ist.  Die erste Bluse (M) zeigte sich nach dem Bügeln als zu groß.  Ich schickte sie zurück und bestellte dieselbe Bluse in Größe S.  Die passt jetzt hervorragend für eine Person mit Größe 38/40.",
