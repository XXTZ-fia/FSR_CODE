Spyderbane,Misleading Labeling and Design - Not a Men's Waistcoat,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OS1Y39LFCVUZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BKZH5H5G,"2.0 "," the United States "," April 22, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Red,Verified Purchase,"I was quite excited about the ""Men's Victorian Suit Vest Steampunk Gothic Medieval Waistcoat Costume"" as the design and fabric initially met my expectations. The fabric is indeed commendable, with a comfortable feel and a quality appearance that promises to stand out at any themed event or costume party.  However, the excitement was short-lived upon discovering a significant issue: this is not a men's waistcoat. The most glaring mistake is that the buttons are on the wrong side, aligning with the style of a woman's garment, not a man's. This is a basic aspect of design that should not be overlooked, especially when the product is specifically marketed for men. It's misleading and could cause inconvenience for anyone looking specifically for men's attire.  Despite the fabric's quality and the vest's overall aesthetic appeal, the incorrect button arrangement is a major drawback. It might be suitable for some buyers who do not mind this issue, but it was a dealbreaker for me. I would advise potential buyers to consider this factor carefully before purchasing.",

However I did know going into buying this that it was going to be big on me, but since it's the only one I could find with the cut style I wanted in white I went for it.Also, the buttons aren't seen on great, and the lining is very baggy inside.

T.F. Allen,"Good quality, but oversized",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23C6F0WH1I33H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BKZH5H5G,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2022",Size: SmallColor: Red,Verified Purchase,"I've bought a few vests like this from other sellers/brands, all in size small. Those fit me perfectly. This one feels a good size and a half too large. I'm a small man: 5'5"" in height, 36S jacket, 28"" waist. So if your measurements are in that vicinity, expect this to need some fairly extensive tailoring.  Beyond the sizing issues, it feels like a very nice vest. Definitely the thickest and heaviest of its kind that I've found. The buttons are, as others have said, a bit large for the button holes, but on my copy, they do still function - just takes some effort. They seem to be sewn on quite securely on mine, unlike other reviewers have mentioned. The hourglass figure that the vest takes on in the product images does not seem to represent the actual cut of the vest, which is fine in my book; I prefer a straighter cut.  Overall, I would suggest you'll probably want to order a size down, as long as you're not quite as small as I am.",11

They were too large to fit in the slits to button. After fixing thst issue all of the buttons came off after buttoning because there was barely and thread holding them on! I had to sew them back on! Super frustrating but I loved everything else about the vest! The length was great the texture was spot on. Just wish the buttons were higher quality.,

Ironically, as I was trying to on for the seamstress, another button popped off.  I would give this product 4 stars but the button eye (The hole for the button) is the main problem and it can’t be cut to fix.  3 stars … This product is good.
