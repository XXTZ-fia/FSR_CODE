Stephanie,Love this top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWE5213HQW1KG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BRCLBFGP,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Pink,Verified Purchase,"I am obsessed with different necklines.

SB — Sr. Product Manager,"So Much Potential, But Missed the Mark",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2U9W5MOGYU62R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BRCLBFGP,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 24, 2024",Size: MediumColor: White Black,Verified Purchase,"I really wanted to love this top—it has such a unique, sexy vibe with the choker neckline and cutout details. But unfortunately, it just didn’t fit right. I sized up to make sure it wasn’t too tight, but the body lost its charm and ended up looking boxy and unflattering. The neckline was as stunning as I hoped, but the overall fit just didn’t do it for me. It’s a gorgeous design, but not quite the right match for my shape, so I had to return it. Such a bummer because I really wanted it to work!",
