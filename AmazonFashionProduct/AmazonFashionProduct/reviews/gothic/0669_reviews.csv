Went to a hibachi birthday dinner and this outfit was perfect! Ordered a size 3x. I’m 5’5 and approximately 195lbs. Heavy bottomed. I did take it in in the waist a little bit but only about a half on both sides! Material is nice and not too thin but thin enough to let your booty switch 😂😂😂😂,

Tiffany R,Love This Dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DWISRIK50SJL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4F7GFJ2,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 28, 2024",Size: 3X-LargeColor: 2-black,,"This Women's Chinese Clothing Gothic Dress is absolutely stunning. I have no idea why it has a low rating other than you have to figure out your sizing. I'm 5""10 and have a longer torso. I tend to size up so the torso area of a dress or shirt is longer on my frame. I've delt with sizing from China before with these types of dresses. I implore you to follow my advice and size up two sizes. I'm an L/XL. Im a 38D. I ordered a 3XL. It's more a L/XL.standard American size. It is Not I repeat a standard American size 3XL. The dress is stretchy and had a black silky spandex look to it and the dragon is embroidered. The material is a wee bit on the heavier side and quality. The dress is zippered in the back. It's fits me like a glove a little loose in some area's but all in all it's perfect. If you choose to order this dress in your true size you will be disappointed because it will not fit. It runs very small so please trust when I say two sizes up. You'll be very pleased that you did. Definitely worth the purchase.",5
