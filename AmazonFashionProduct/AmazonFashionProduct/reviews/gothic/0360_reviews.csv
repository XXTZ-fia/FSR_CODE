Sidra,Too small and short,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWJHG6TTVX91F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9M6RZ6W,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",Color: RedSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,This item was too small and short. I’m 5’11” and ordered a size larger than I usually wear and it was still small. Also when I tried to return it the shipping was over $40 because it had to be shipped to China. Thankfully the person refunded me my money fully when I explained the shipping was more than I paid for the product.,
Amazing product recommend to everyone. It was easy to install in shower. Once I swap it out to new one I see everything that gets accumulated from the water.

I am 5’4” and small in most places except my boobs and hips. I bought the XL because that’s what would be best with the corset style in the front and back. It did fit well when cinched up in the middle. However, the arms are ridiculous. I could fit at least two of my arms in there, and the part that should hit right under my elbow (it should start there) hits at my wrists, making the sheer part drag the floor when my hands are held at my waist. I could theoretically alter this and make it work, but it’s not worth the effort. I thought about trying the Large, but I’m afraid it would be too small around the middle with the corset ties—the effect wouldn’t be right—and I doubt there would be much difference in the arm length and width. I expected it to be too long. That’s not a problem. But the arms? A monkey’s arms aren’t that proportionally off!",8
