I built a whole outfit around it and it was fabulous! That being said, I was glad I brought a layer along with me because the buttons of the shoulder straps (which hold the dress up) magically disappeared off the dress during the concert and I wasn't doing anything strenuous to cause major wear and tear (like dancing or anything) since it was a squished, seated venue. Thankfully the fit was pretty good on me, but if it had been looser, the dress might have fallen down! 😅 Now I need to purchase buttons to sew in. Not fantastic for a first wear. That one small issue aside, it is cool that the straps have multiple button holes so you can adjust the straps' lengths and the lighter weight of the fabric was good for someone who runs warm like me. For the price point, it seems fair, but beware those buttons popping off so you don't have any wardrobe malfunctions!",4

This dress may be running a tad large. I would definitely not size up. Because my daughter had a lot of extra room in the bust area, this dress could work for bustier ladies. This dress's fabric is soft and I did not see any issues with the stitching. We couldn't use the belts to tighten the dress, which was something I had hoped for. Although I think this dress looks great with a petticoat underneath, my daughter preferred it without. I've uploaded photos of both looks so people can see what the differences are.",6

You really have no way of resizing or shaping this dress.  You have to get the size right, or it has to fit you exactly.The dress looks better from a distance; once you get close, you can see that it's a kind of inexpensive fabric.  However, for any costume, it's pretty well done, and it's not too expensive.  Highly recommended.",

CRC,The bust is very roomy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1I82D3FWDKD03/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B3RRXHRX,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 21, 2022",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,,"I am 215 lbs, 5’7” (wearing 4” heels) 37” waist, 41” bust/C cup, 46” hip. Pictured is size XL.  I always order XL in Scarlet Darkness brand as the 2XL is always too big. This fits my body appropriately around all parts of my body EXCEPT the bust. The shoulder straps have the nice option of being adjustable, so if I wear them at the smallest setting (pictured) it’s not as obvious that I don’t fill the top out. However there is still some puckering that happens near/below the armpit and the top buckle sits on the bottom of my bust line. So, saying that if you have a larger bust this dress might work out well for you. I really like the high-low feature of the skirt because I know for certain it’s always covering my big butt.  The fabric is the same type of fabric that SD usually uses. It’s thin costume-y fabric, but after wearing this twice now it’s actually really comfortable in Florida. It probably needs a dramatic steam, but I’ve been a bit busy getting ready for the fall semester.  My mom said the buckles look especially cheap, the metal doesn’t even look like metal. The dress over all is very comfortable and probably reasonable for the price point since it’s under $40.",9

There are little belt straps in the front that creates a smaller waist and style and it is trimmed with a light ruffle. My wife loves the comfort of this dress.

I had to adjust the straps to the last button loops and still don't exactly get the cleavage I would like from this style of dress  . I love that the front is slightly shorter than the back, it gives you a bit more leg and really adds a nice silhouette to the look.
