Emily Vaccaro,Perfect for costume,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NJB41D0F2DHX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3TG4HGP,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: Green,Verified Purchase,This was perfect for my Medusa costume. Got lots of compliments and I sent the link to a couple people at the Halloween party. Cant wait to try out the other two colors I got of this!,
PH,pretty stone,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GFEVGVCMA24S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3TG4HGP,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2024",Color: Light Blue,Verified Purchase,I loved the color of the stone and Victorian style. The chain it comes on has a cheap feel and it is hard to clasp. Great price point so I will replace the chain with a velvet cord with clasp to make it a little longer and easier to clasp. Overall very pretty for the price.,
Pamela,Cheap cheap!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5NQGWVYIT6ZZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3TG4HGP,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 25, 2024",Color: Green,Verified Purchase,"Yeah it was only 9.99 but I didn’t expect it to look and feel like a toy. I would return it but I’m wearing it for Wicked dress up, after it will go in the garbage. If you’re buying it as a nice piece of costume jewelry to wear out, don’t buy it.",
Joanna Lynn,"Beautiful Pendant, but the clasp doesn't work at all",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4WQSKCEDFMUQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3TG4HGP,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 23, 2024",Color: Purple,Verified Purchase,"I got this for a goth princess peach costume. I wanted to go with purple instead of blue for the brooch she wears. Unfortunately, I couldn't even try it on as the pendant does not come on the necklace, and I couldn't get the clasp open (it seems like there's so spring - I started to chip the pain from how hard I was trying to open the clasp). Quality of the chain is very poor if I can't even unclasp it to put it on. I had to order a separate black chain in order to use the pendant as intended.",
CLG,Necklace chain doesn't work,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LX52L9WNTWTU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3TG4HGP,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 23, 2024",Color: Purple,Verified Purchase,The pendant is a nice inexpensive jewelry addition for my gothic Halloween costumes.
