It felt like sandpaper. I read a review on how to fix it and she said to steam it so I gave it a try. Sure enough the lace/tinsel feels ALOT smoother on my skin! I did notice how ever I got a tiny bit to close with my steamer and it made a tiny hole. I can saw it easy peasy but still it’s lace/tinsel and will burn through very easily. So if you are going to steam it be super careful on not getting to close!",11

This dress would be perfect for themed events or holidays. It has pockets which came in handy. Loved the keyhole in front. Fit is very comfortable but, definitely true to size so if you have larger breasts or a little extra belly fat, I recommend sizing up 1 size. The dress is comfortable but was a bit of a tight squeeze to zip in the torso area; which is why I mention the above. With that said, I didn't have help so I had to zip it up myself. Overall very pleased with my purchase. Recommend it!",4

It is not an a-line dress. The length of it is shorter as well as the sleeves. I ordered the dress for a wedding expecting to get what was on the picture and now it is too late for me to return it. This is very disappointing. I am very upset that now I don’t have the time to go and purchase a new dress because this was really what I wanted.,7

I'm a C cup and it was a little tight around the chest area. It felt like it would pop if I breathed wrong but it never did. I've worn it six times now and I really like how it fits. My best advice is to go an extra size than what you are so it's more comfortable. Otherwise, it was prefect in very other way, and the underlayer is very comfortable too! <3",3

I would suggest steaming it because it does look wrinkly at first. I will say that you definitely need to size up. I’m usually a L-XL in dresses and I ordered a XXL and it was a good fit. A little tight in the bust but I can get away with it because I don’t have much. Those with bigger busts: I’d recommend not to purchase this or you can get a slip dress to wear underneath because this dress surprisingly comes in 2 pieces. The under slip layer and then the top mesh layer. It also looked very flat compared to the picture when I first tried it on so I purchased a petticoat to wear underneath and that did the trick because now it looks perfect. Overall, I’m very satisfied with the dress and I can’t wait to wear it out this weekend.",29

I usually wear a medium but I should have got a large. I felt like I had to be a contortionist to get into the dress, but once it was on it was cute, because of it being tight I would probably only wear this dress one more time, but because I’m already in the process of losing weight I kept it. I would suggest for anyone else to size up one though.",4
