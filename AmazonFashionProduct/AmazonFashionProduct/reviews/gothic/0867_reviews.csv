Mrs.Right,it's kinda cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3H4AL7KDAU2G5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4B7PHH9,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 1, 2024",Color: Z3002rdSize: XX-Large,,"This jacket has a very interchangeable style that can mesh anywhere from classic to gothic, vampy, victorian, to military looking style..... As for me... that's just perfect for my wardrobe. The fabric seems to be sturdy and durable. It isn't lined, but is double layered in the chest area, and I think it will be easy to clean. It does only come with the one button, which is okay, but I think I will add an additional two for looks. The fit is spot on for it's sizing. I was worried since I have a larger chest, but nonetheless they fit. The back of the jacket has a corset like loop and tie setup to allot for a more for custom fit. It's a decent jacket overall.",14
Al,"So many options with this ""Victorian"" jacket!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HOXBKP94RKLK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4B7PHH9,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 25, 2024",Color: Z3002bkSize: XX-Large,,"This jacket is so cool! It is like a blank slate and your creativity can go any direction you'd like. And what a great price. It is thick polyester fabric and well put together. This jacket lends itself to being transformed. Replace the cinch tie with a beautiful thick satin ribbon. Change out the waist button and keep going with buttons all the way around. Of course matching buttons for the cuffs would be sooo right :) Add a brooch or 8 brooches in different areas. You could add skull buttons on the cuffs. Apply studs, silver or gold, all over the jacket or in a pattern(s) Drape thick or thin chains No matter what a top hat is a must for this jacket. A needle and thread or even a glue gun this jacket should be adorned! Halloween, festival, or out to dinner! Have fun with this costume jacket!",11
Rebecca D.,"Great quality, but very big!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD5VI6YK0O7Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4B7PHH9,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 11, 2024",Color: Z3002bkSize: Medium,,"This costume Victorian coat is very good quality, but I could only give it 4 stars due to the fit. The pictures of the item show it having a very tiny waist, so when I looked at the size chart, it didn't make sense because the waist measurements were very large. So, I ordered my typical size (Med), and it fit me like an extra large! Everything was way too big, the sleeve length, the shoulder width, the length, and most importantly, the waist. It's so big that I won't be able to wear it, it just looks silly. I would say this item runs at least 2 sizes too big, so the size may be correct, but if so, even the smallest would've been too big for me...just confusing.",8
