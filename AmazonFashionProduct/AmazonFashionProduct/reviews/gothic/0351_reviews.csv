The sleeves and lace are really nice and it comes with a front ruffle piece and a rhinestone brooch. It is so sparkly and pretty in person. It doesn't give off a cheap costume look. In fact, it has an aristocratic victorian look to it. The lace up back really completes the look and makes it seem like a tailored custom fit. I almost want to wear this out running errands its so pretty. Highly highly recommend!",4

The design is excellent and well executed, a notch above the standard costume.  The material looks like cotton which fits with the Victorian theme, but is stretchy and forgiving.  The XXL fit my plus 18/20 W figure well, with the exception of the bust area as other reviewers noted (mine is 48 inches which is within the size range but....  would be gaping open without a pin).  Reading other reviews, I was convinced it was not going to fit but gave it a shot and was pleasantly surprised.  There isn't an inch to pinch, but the snug fit is flattering.  I'll wear a tank underneath and pin the bust area.  Will be part of a fun witch costume along with a Victorian skirt.  A bit more sophisticated than the usual ""sexy"" witch costume, but not frumpy at all.",3

Very short (pictured is only 5’ 4”) Bust buttons pop open.  This was used for a musical. It gave us exactly the look we were going for. However. We had to order 2 sizes larger than usual for the bust to not burst open if the stays were tied. By that point the arms abc shoulders were quite large. We were using a high waist skirt so the shortness was covered, but fit reference it only went about an inch and a half below her skirt top.  I was still pleased with it and was glad it was available.

Erin McGrew,"Sizing is odd, quality is decent",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R162MQFR6OJGXM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09MYYZWCJ,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 4, 2024",Size: MediumColor: 010 Black,Verified Purchase,"Overall the quality is as-expected if not a little bit better. My issue here is with the fit. I ordered a size medium because I knew this fabric would have no give to it and some other reviews said to size up due to the bust area. As you can see there’s some gaping and tightness in the chest area, but the collar, waist, and sleeves are very big. I tried cinching the shirt a bit tighter to get a better shape and alleviate some of the bagginess but then it looks odd in the back (the chest was a bit too small even before cinching).  If I sized down the bust would definitely be way too small - this shirt is better suited for people with a smaller chest (I am 34C for reference).  It feels comfortable and the details look great though! Actually the brooch is way better than what I expected. If you’re willing to sacrifice some more specific aesthetic details for an overall look and a comfortable shirt then this would be a good pick.",6

Luckily I was using it with a corset anyways to kinda compensate that and if you have a larger chest expect there to be gaps in the buttons. The ruffled collar at least hid mine. Lol. Other than that the fit is very flattering and I don’t feel like there is a bunch of extra fabric around the shoulder and arm pit area like with some other XXL shirts. I only recommendation would be. It would be great if they could make this a tad bit longer even if just by 2 inches.,

One thing I would say is to trust the size chart included in the product photos.  I had initially ordered a Small based on the size chart, but read through some of the reviews and got nervous and sized up.  While it doesn't fit terribly, I definitely think that I could have stuck with the Small and have been fine.",2

But since it's costume material, you can see your bra through it; so it would be recommended to wear something white underneath it, or wear something on top of it like a suit vest or a corset. The shirt does have its own corset lace in the back, but I think it depends on what size you get that determines how well it functions? When I tightened it on me, it looked nice, but restricted my ability to move my arms much without the whole shirt coming up, if that makes sense. I wear a size small and ordered a size small, and it fits me just fine, but I am smaller than the average person, so depending on your body type it might be good to heed the advice of the other reviews.  TLDR: Fits and looks good, but might not be true to size for some people. Fabric is costume material and see through in the chest area, would be a good idea to wear something under or over it. Looks exactly as pictured, comes in quickly with Prime. Would recommend for Halloween or cosplay.",2
