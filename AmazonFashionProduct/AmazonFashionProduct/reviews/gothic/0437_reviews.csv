Luckipuppi,Measure Yourself,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3COGSW8TPLQGV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07778XG33,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I’ve got two significant pieces of advice for you. 1. Make sure to accurately measure your waist 2. Order it  The size chart specifically states that it was updated 08/2024. Since we are now past that, if you’re ordering now, you can trust it. My waist is currently 31”. Because that’s very close to being between XL and XXL, I ordered them both. The XL fit fantastically. I posted a picture showing how the back lacing looked. It was even a bit tighter after having someone else help me.  I wore this to a masquerade ball and got compliments all night. Even after the event, a few people kept telling me how amazing the dress looked. For the price, I couldn’t have found a better option (and I searched all over). Plus, it’s a legitimate outfit, as in not just some cheap Halloween style junk. Even after having quite a few people step on my skirt, it’s still undamaged and perfectly wearable.",

The corset is very easy to wear and self-tighten. Remember though, this IS a costume so you will not have the ultra firm fabric panels between the boning. I added some stiffener pieces to balance that out.  Compliments the entire night, in fact I was taken as “staff” of the event several times; real staff even complimented me on the look.",2

Plan was to dress in Gothic/Victorian attire. I am 5’6 and 143lbs and the XL fit great with just an inch or so of space before corset was completely tightened so a large may have worked as well if corset was loosened more as it does have a 4in modesty panel. I was able to wiggle in it by myself but the buttons were pretty difficult to hook back together so it might be easier to loosen the corset and leave buttons closed (if you have someone to help tighten back up). The skirt was long and flowy and had an elastic waist so it could fit a variety of waist sizes smaller or larger. It did seem a bit long but hopefully I can find some heeled boots or platforms to help but I bet I can pin up/roll up at the waist or pull up higher under the corset to shorten the length some.,8

I got this dress and put a tulle petticoat under it.  The compliments I received were endless.  My husband loved it.  I was shocked that it didn’t look as costumey as I thought after I used the tulle petticoat (I got off Amazon too) to make it look so much more expensive.  My husband said that he saw a lot of jealous women eyeing me.  I had people make  it a point to come up to me and give me compliments.  The corset made it elegant as it was well made and beautifully put together.  I did order a size up as I knew I had to listen to endless command speeches and wanted to sit more comfortably.  I also liked the idea of having an open back so I actually didn’t use the back modesty panel.  I just tucked it into the corset as it’s attached.  If I wanted to do so I would have had to get 2 sizes up instead of 1 but I wanted an open back.  We had a photographer at the ball who kept taking pictures of me as my dress was so elaborate.  Most of the guys go out for an after party in the city so I walked around in that dress late into the night and had no issues.  You may need a little help having someone lace you up.  My husband got me into it easily but since it is laced up in the back it needs another person to help you into it.  The corset is very expensive looking.  The sleeves I was worried would look cheap but since they are black they blend in very well.  It’s a very dramatic dress yet very modern.  I was concerned I’d look like a saloon girl in those amusement park photos but this was so well done it looked like a modern dress with my petticoat.  I don’t know how I’ll top this dress next year.  His Lt. made it a point to compliment the dress.  I would highly recommend this and for the price it’s not just a cheap tatty dress.,38

I usually wear a size Large (5’4” and 170lbs) but based off other reviews I ordered a 3XL and it fit great. I think I could’ve gone with the 2XL by releasing the lace-up back which is adjustable. The front closure hooks are a little tricky to fasten on your own. I needed an assistant! The red color is gorgeous and I would recommend it over the all black as you can see the lace detail much better. The pictures are before I steamed the skirt which I also highly recommend. Someone mentioned a cigarette smoke smell in another review and it definitely was present. I let the costume air out for a couple of days before wearing it. Overall very happy and got tons of compliments.,21

So I went with the XXL.  It has room in the corset. So you can adjust it quite a bit. The skirt is elastic and has quite a bit of room as well.I'm usually a 14 or 16. I'm not well endowed. 40B-C. Waist is 35ish Hips 43ish. I'm 5'6, 165.STEAM the skirt. If you don't have a ""My Little Steamer"". Get one.  Promise you'll thank me.  Don't get a knock off.  Get that brand. You'll wonder why you didn't before.I'm pretty modest. So I bought one of the black peasant shirts and just stuffed the lace corset sleeves in.  They're just lace.

The arms have some minor elastic/stretch but if you have extremely big arms and/or a large chest you might want to size up even further. I normally wear a size medium and I got a xl.

If you’re normally a size small, you’ll be a medium on the product sizing chart. I’m 5’5 125lbs and a medium fits me well.  The corset is well made, it does not give off a cheap look at all. It has some flexibility with sizing with the lace up in the back.  My only issue has nothing to do with the costume itself, this is a notice for smaller chested ladies. The corset seemed to smash my little chicken cutlets down to make me look flatter than I already am. It’s just a flat garment that is designed to push up bigger boobs. If you have no boobs, there’s nothing to push up. I put in some falsies which seemed to help a little bit.  Some reviewers said the skirt wasn’t poofy enough but I disagree. It has plenty of poof and the lace is very pretty.  Lastly, as promised, this costume was delivered on time.  I would highly recommend this costume!
