I can only see this fitting someone extremely short torso. It looks ridiculous on.,

Its color is kind of comparable to burnt caramel, and it has a cotton-linen feel to it. Very light and flowy. I bought this dress for everyday wear. It won't be warm enough for this season, but it will be perfect for the spring. I dress modestly for religious reasons, and always find it difficult to find dresses that are modest and pretty too. This one absolutely fits the bill. I will most likely get the green and black one too. I highly recommend!!",3

But there was no identifying tag for me to determine what it was made from, and I no longer waste my money on synthetics (too much damage to health and the planet). So I had no choice but to return it, since I can't wear it without knowing what is made of",2

My only complaint was the button holes were a bit too snug so had to force button into holes but overall I'm pleased with the dress for my 1880's day costume as a schoolmarm. Color is as shown.

Not sure if this was returned by someone else and then sent to me but was definitely not ok. Otherwise the dress was cute, decent material, but a little on the thin side. Can see through it when held up.",2

Dustin R.,"Short, but period accurate for a lower class working person of the early 1900s",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNILHB5KTNCO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CBPPZLZX,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 26, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Dark Black,Verified Purchase,"This is great for like a working class girl who maybe worked in a dress shop in the late 1800s or early 1900s. It works great with a pinafore style apron and would be of a fabric that that class could afford at that time. But it looks like the higher quality styles worn by the wealthy. It's also a full elastic waist, so it would fit corsets or not. The only issue is that it is fairly short. The person wearing it was 5 foot and it didn't touch the ground. I got her a Large. She normally wears a small/medium. The waist was plenty big, but the bust was snug enough. It's easy to wash and overall I highly recommend it. But for the length...you really need an underskirt which I was trying to avoid. Also, the photo is not the exact item...or at the very least the skirt is not nearly that full. it would not fit a hoop skirt, but it would fit a non-hooped petticoat, so if anyone is trying to make it work for say Scarlett at the rummage sale after she's a widow...it would not be wide enough. It's basically linen...it's a muslin-esque fabric. It arrived...damp, but it arrived in less than 24 to a place that does not even do 2 day prime shipping. So that was impressive, the other items inside were NOT damp though which was weird.",9
