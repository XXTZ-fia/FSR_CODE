Mything Lynx,Very high quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JPEOQQG5KMYT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N13WTJV,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 17, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"This product is very well made and of excellent quality. I was very happy and surprised that what I received was exactly what was pictured and what I was expecting. The super soft but sturdy rope belt is as thick as what they advertise which is exactly what I needed for a rope belt for my ancient Druid costume for Halloween. I am overweight with a 45"" waist so I purchased two of these badboys and tied them together to make it twice as long so I can wrap it around me three times and still have about 6 or 7 inches of rope to hang down like tassels. I also purchased a resin wolf skull on Amazon and I am threading this rope through the eye sockets to wear as a cool looking codpiece. I love this product and I am a very happy customer. I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested.",
Adam,Not much to it. Great in it's simplicity.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD2M17SWL15KG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N13WTJV,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 20, 2023",Size: One SizeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,Used for an outfit. It's simple... but it's quality. Good materials and has gone through some use with no issues.,
nick,Looked nice but...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3163CSTWES4LO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N13WTJV,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 9, 2022",Size: One SizeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,Immediately feel apart in the washing machine.

Saco Al,Pricy but well worth it.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YOXMTQ59JX7L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N13WTJV,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 29, 2022",Size: FreeColor: Ivory,Verified Purchase,I bought this as a bathrobe belt and it's super. The texture makes it easy to bind to each other and so does not unravel. All other bathrobe belts are made of slippery fabrics that unfold easily. Also this belt is great looking and feeling as well.  You'll never find a better belt or a better looking one.,
Jesse Alan Marden,"Soft, Sturdy",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZYHZ2CVJIQVY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N13WTJV,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 8, 2022",Size: One SizeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Unexpectedly soft! I was worried it would start to unravel or fray easily, especially with frequent use as part of a Ren Fair costume worn for 8 hour days in the sun. Turned out not to be a problem! And the ends are bound with glue or thread, not knotted, so you don’t have clunky knots on the ends to get in the way. But also there’s still fringe on the ends to make it look authentic. Stayed in place all day as a belt with my robe in a Ren Fest costume, and wasn’t too tick to string my pouches and accessories onto.",
