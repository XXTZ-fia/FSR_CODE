The bodice is double thick so doesn't show through like many white shirts and has just enough stretch to make it both comfortable and well fitted. I really really wanted to like and keep this shirt but for the sleeves. Yes, if you are looking for really poofy pirate sleeves this shirt is awesome. However, I was looking to wear this more day-today as something under a corset or jacket. I could actually have dealt with the poofy sleeves but the main issue was with the elastic at the cuffs. Yes, there is elastic but it is so loose that the sleeves essentially just hang and cannot even be pushed up to the elbows to stay up. Overall, this looseness at the wrists made me feel like perhaps I had forgotten to button the sleeves and would have been quite annoying by the end of the day. I thought about adding a button/snap/additional elastic to tighten things up but decided against it. So, overall impression would be that the shirt itself was GREAT but for the sleeves. Kinda sad I had to return it.",8

The material is very nice. The bodice and sleeves are a sturdy cotton. The lower portion is has spandex, which gives it a smooth feel and some stretch. My niece is very petite, so the bottom hem hit around her hip area. The sleeves also went down to her wrists, and she must wear it on her shoulders. She's too petite to wear it off the shoulders, which would make the sleeves too long. The neckline is very pretty and flattering. It's versatile enough to be worn with jeans or dressed up with a nice skirt. She told me that the thing she likes most is that it looks dressy but is as comfortable as a tee shirt. I will definitely look into other items made by this clothing brand.",8
