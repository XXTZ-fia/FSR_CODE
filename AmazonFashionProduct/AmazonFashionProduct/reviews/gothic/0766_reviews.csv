It’s a great dress to dress up for the fair and can be added to for a more dramatic look, but also not too crazy for a first time person dressing up.  The only downfall is that it is very hard to get the wrinkles out if you do not have a steamer. My steamer got them right out though.",5

When I did try using it though, the zipper got stuck somewhere and got misaligned. It was thankfully fixed though once it got all the way back down.

I highly recommend ironing it before wearing, because it is not super thick fabric so it's prone to wrinkling. It makes a world of difference, trust me.  It was comfortable to wear all day, and if you want to wear it outside of a Ren Faire atmosphere, it's passible as just a cute cottage core outfit. I wore nip covers with it, and you couldn't see them through the fabric.  If your shoulders/arms are sensitive and don't like having tight spots on your sleeves, you might not like it. I am able to get used to it but sometimes that kind of thing bothers me so!  Overall pretty worth. If you want a quick little thing to wear without much prep, get it!",

I love the little protective skirt underneath as it makes it feel more safe to wear when it’s a little more windy or when you have the string pulled out all the way up, looked beautiful with the corset I got to go with it, fits nicely and is pretty good quality. I will say tho a slight problem I had was the shoulders. It would be on my shoulders and fall down, but when it was done would start to slide down and show my bra, it was an easy fix but was annoying while it happened.",
M. Rook,Not for hefty chesties,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38LNGPHBH640H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BW61Y3DW,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 18, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Dark Green,Verified Purchase,"This product fit great!…. From the waist down. The elastic on the neckline meant my generous tatas were tap dancing with my belly button—that is to say, they were putting on a show. It might have worked had the neckline been as uncompromising as the fabric or if the silly useless drawstrings in the middle were, well, drawstrings. As it was, the dress is suited for the Ren Faire’s 21+ day-drinking day, no kids allowed, which I’m certainly not comfortable with. That also means I can’t include a photo to show you. Just trust me on this.  The material of the fabric itself also seemed cheap, with a slip that felt as ghastly as the most inexpensive, polyester microfiber bedsheets. With the price of the dress, it’s not that big of a shock, but I had really hoped for something I could wear everyday like a mushroom-foraging princess. Instead, it’s like a Halloween costume cast off.  If you’re looking for a disposable, inexpensive, one-time wear, and you regularly can forego over-the-shoulder boulder-holders, this might work for you. For me? It’s a return. Sorry.  Oh, two stars instead of one because from the waist-down, it fit lovely. Also, I think it is mostly meant to be a costume, and for that it would work.",

Like real deep pockets (the outer layer also has pockets) I kept forgetting my phone was even in them because they were so secure. I have gained a lot of weight since becoming a mom, and I've never had much self esteem. The only other time I have felt this good about the way I looked was at my wedding.  The material seemed very durable but also very comfortable. It didn't get dirty when I was sitting on the ground or playing with my daughter. I have not been given anything to write this review.

Most importantly, I didn’t like that the seller purposefully overpriced this dress (the seller originally priced this at around $42.99), but you can find the same thing on Aliexpress for $23 as of now.

Cons: 1) The fabric feels lightweight but it’s very obviously a fabric that isn’t going to breathe well. 2) The fabric is also incredibly wrinkly and the dress will need multiple washings and probably some intense ironing before I can wear it out. 3) The color is not accurate at all. I was anticipating a rich green. This is definitely in the olive/army green realm. It still matches my corset ok, but not 100% what I wanted.

The top is also really loose. I’m a cup size B and about 36 inches around the breast. There’s no way to tighten the top. It’d have to wear this dress only with the sleeves up or the top will be falling down off my chest. The texture of fabric is that cheap polyester - it feels like the stuff tents are made of- and isn’t breathable at all.
