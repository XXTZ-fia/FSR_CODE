The neckline is absolutely nothing like the picture. And the sleeves were very long so I ordered a L to see if it fit better. The L dress is exactly like the picture with the right neckline and it’s a far better material - thicker and heavier. So I thought maybe they sent the wrong dress the first time. I ordered another XL (I still have the first XL so I know they didn’t send that one again) and again, it is not the same pictured dress. There is no shape to the neckline and the material is thinner and lighter. Why would different sizes be completely different dresses?",2

I wanted a ""Morticia Adams"" look, and this was one of the few dresses that shipped locally and fast! (Order hack: Check the estimated delivery date!!) It is a simple dress, multi-blend synthetic fabric. Single layer. I was slightly underwhelmed by how simple it was, so I styled it up a bit with an underbust corsette, brooch, mini top hat, and designer heels. The material is very stretchy, so it hugs my curves nicely with room to breathe. Pro: There is a short train too, which was dramatic, but didn't get in the way. Con: The scalloped neckline didnt stay in place because the single layer of fabric was so thin. You could probably solve that with double sided fabric tape though. Next year, I'll probably wear this dress with a witch's hat for Halloween.",4

I'm 5' 6 1/2"" tall and the dress doesn't even come to the top of my feet, the train is great though.  The neck line comes up closer to my collar bone rather then my bust line and it's made for people who's boobs are under their cos lol,  but I went off mostly that first picture then a few over that shows more of what the dress looks like so that was my fault.  The material is very nice and I do love the sleeves and the train. My biggest areas I hate is the neck line, the high chest area,  and the length of the front of the dress.  I'll post the pictures to show you what one I thought I was getting when I ordered it and the one the dress really looks like.",2
