Aurora Zetanova,Love!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Q4X5832XM1JB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYCDLVQ3,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Pink,Verified Purchase,"Contrary to other reviews,  I found the size to be perfect! I have a 40"" bust,  35"" underbust, 28"" waist,  and 39"" hips. I went with a SMALL and the bottoms fit great! I'll need a large for the top (I have to mix sizes in ALL bikinis).I got the one that's pink leopard with skulls and metal hearts. There aren't many skulls and most people don't even notice them.  Mostly I just get a LOT of compliments. Not only do I love the fit, but the style is perfect and the print is super cute!",
amanda,Runs super small.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13QILWM2C78EI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYCDLVQ3,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 3, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Pink,Verified Purchase,Super small . Cute but can't wear,
Stephanie,Wayyy too small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YBMED83HWATJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYCDLVQ3,"2.0 "," the United States "," July 29, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Pink,Verified Purchase,"It's cute but the top is wayy too small, definitely size up. I got a size small (normally my size is xs so I was scared it wouldn't fit) and  the top is so small, I can't fit my A cup chest in it",
M,Definitely runs small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BRZVCVS7U0V0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYCDLVQ3,"3.0 "," the United States "," April 14, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Pink,Verified Purchase,"I ordered an extra large and this fit me like a medium. I'm a size 8 to 10 pants and a medium shirt with 34ddd bra. This was definitely not enough coverage on the chest. I'm really sad too because I love this bikini, I just wish they made it in even bigger sizes or true to size. Normally swim I'm a large bottom and extra large top. Really well made and has really nice material and doesn't feel cheap! I just really really really wish the size was accurate.",
