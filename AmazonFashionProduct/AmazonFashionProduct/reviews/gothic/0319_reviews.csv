I love the look. I get stuck in it a lot cuz of the zipper ending where I cant reach it so take heed & don't be alone when putting it on or off. It fits nicely though. Its hard to go into certain shops cuz of hoop so you might want to plan the day right to avoid awkward areas & seats.,

My only complaint is that the zipper sticks around the waist seam, making it impossible to zip up yourself, and was even quite difficult for my husband to do for me. The quality is so nice that I may consider having a tailor re-do the zipper. Used for a Nadja costume and got hundreds of compliments over the several Halloween events we attended!",

If you are a perfectionist, you might want to tailor it to be perfectly fitted, but I had a fine time with exactly what came in the mail.  I had a Victorian lace collar and a corset of my own but at the end of the day, the belt that cam with it was more flattering and made me look less squat.  I am 5'7 and if I were taller I would have wanted a black wide slip under, as it was itnwas almost short, but I guess I was lucky and it hid my boots alright.I won the Most Original Costume as Catrina for Dio de los Muertos.Honestly the dress is sturdy, the zipper was perfect and really well constructed.  It came with and authentic but light and wieldy hoop skirt.  It was not lined but the satin it was made with is so solid, it did not need a lining and thank goodness for that, otherwise I would have overheated while dancing.  Overall, I feel as though I got an amazing deal.  It could have easily cost 5-8 times more from a company here in California, or I could have spent twice the price just to rent it, instead I own it for under $80 including tax.  There was absolutely no smell of anything, perfect to wear out of the package.  I ordered up so I could be sure of a good fit in time for Halloween and it was roomy but perfect with the belt to cinch the waste and the hoop skirt was the same, roomy as a large.  I have 31"" waist, 43"" hips, 38"" bust and I could have easily fit a medium.  These are American or Western sizes and a large was very very roomy through the waist, shoulders and bust.  I wear a 10/12 and this probably could have fit a 16/18.  There is no stretch, it is made from a sturdy washable satin, and the dress interior is totally finished, very comfortable, what you would expect from clothing from Kohl's,  all the seams were finished and smooth.  It is completely functional, everything works as designed to work.This is a brilliant product and I recommend and will buy from the manufacturer again, no doubt. 10/10.",

Such nice quality. Perfect for Nadja. It was alot of fabric so I was a little hot at the convention, mostly the chest part as there’s not much room to breath, but not the skirt part that was very airy! I had a little fan with me, that helped. I got the 2X but I’m wondering if the XL would have been better, less fabric maybe? But all in all it was great we got so many compliments. And we met the actor who plays Nandor! He loved our costumes so I think if this dress is Nandor approved it’s an A+!!! ♥️🖤",3

I bought it to wear as a Victorian ghost and again to a Victorian themed Thanksgiving event. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it’s better made than expected and feels like a real dress.  The laces on the side allow for a custom fit and the details are really nice, from the buttons to the ruffles. The hoop skirt gives it extra authenticity and flair. The material is perfect for what it is. It’s not a super high quality but doesn’t feel like a cheap costume.  As far as fit, I think it’s true to size. I’m 5’8”, 145lbs and typically wear a medium. The medium fits perfectly and the ties make it easier to get the best look for my shape.  I’m so excited to wear this!

I tried it on for size today, I am 5’8” and about 155 lbs, small bust. This dress is pretty large on top and the arms but once the corset part is on it cinches the wait really nice and gives me a great shape. The hoop skirt is stretchy but a little tight around my waist and the Velcro is a little itchy but not too bad. Definitely need to wear some tights with this dress since the hoop skirt opens it up and create a breeze down there. It was a little spendy at $80 for a Halloween costume but I hope to get some wear out of it over the years. I’ll Update after Halloween if anything goes wrong with it, but I’m excited to wear it!",
