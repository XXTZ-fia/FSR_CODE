Sarah,Meh,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OV7CB6JQ2J32/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM33T5K1,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 13, 2024",Size: 4XColor: Black_01,Verified Purchase,"I’m 5’7.5” (the half matters) and these are still quite long on me. They barely look like a flare, just kind of a loose leg altogether.",
dustin adams,Graphic flare leggings,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RALXHN4QDTBHC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM33T5K1,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 15, 2024",Size: Medium PlusColor: Black_01,,These fit very well and are comfortable. I did however notice that the pattern is distorted when the fabric is stretched. We'll have to see over time how the design holds up when being washed.,
Catcala,Finally a Pair That Fit To The Measurements,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLJDV83Z7ZTN6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM33T5K1,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 7, 2024",Size: 3XColor: Black_05,,I have been trying to find black yoga pants that fit the brands measurements given. These definitely cover that and fit my size as expected. But these aren’t your basic yoga pants so I will have to keep looking for those. What these pants are is beautiful dressy pants with a gothic vibe. A black on black velvet type of fabric with a floral type design swirling down the legs. Very wide bell bottoms finish them off. Wide elastic at waist which is very comfortable. They really are stunning.,
Antigone Walsh,Very Cool,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTSSBBGAK8ECR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM33T5K1,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 6, 2024",Size: 2XColor: Black_05,,"These pants look super cool and are very comfortable. The fabric has some stretch. True to size they are quite flared, like bell bottoms. They run long. I am tall and these I will wear with heels. Great look and feel.",
Sasha,FINALLY! Pants that aren't too short!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3THFSAF7TELGQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM33T5K1,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 1, 2024",Size: 3XColor: Black_05,,"I love these and am so relieved to finally find something catered to the tall girls. I am 5'10, with most of my height and weight being below the waist. Do you know how hard it is to find something in my size (18-20) that ALSO goes past my ankles? A standard 28'' inseam only hits at the top of my timberlands/docs, and I'm guessing these are around a 32'' inseam. Half the reason I wear boots is so no one can tell my pants aren't long enough. I am genuinely overjoyed to finally have something that looks the same on me as it does the photo. It fits great, and is accurate to the size chart. It is nicely nipped in at the waist to provide plenty of definition but also stretchy enough to be comfortable without digging in and making new rolls where there shouldn't be any. It is nicely fitted in the thighs, with plenty of thoughtful tailoring in the curvature of the seams so its not super boxy in the crotch especially. The bottom of the legs flare out, almost like bell bottoms. It looks great, very flattering! I got the velvet ones with the roses and its super pretty but very understated. The texture is nice, very soft so far, and pretty stretchy too. Petite ladies I am so sorry this may not be for you unless you are willing to hem them yourself, but please, let us have this. Its been so long, and my ankles are so cold... Plus size and tall girl approved!",
Carseatmommy,Very comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPK0X59TUUI2Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM33T5K1,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 28, 2024",Size: 2XColor: Black_05,,"These leggings are very comfortable and very flared. I think they reach into bellbottom territory, which is fine with me! I chose my size based on the measurements listed in the size chart, and the fit is great. The material is the perfect amount of stretch, and the stitching seems to be good quality. The legs are a little too long for me, but would probably work fine if I still had my super high-heeled platform gothy boots. With how super comfy these leggings are, I’d be fine just wearing them around the house.",
J. Winnie,Fits well and looks great!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34TYUDE3WOT6M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM33T5K1,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 23, 2024",,,"These pants are cute and true to US sizing. I got these for my wife and she loves them! She loves the goth and Halloween vibe and these are bright and fun. We got the bright green skeletons which goes perfectly with a green coffin purse she has. She's taller at 5'9"" and the length is still perfect for her. The material is stretchy and comfortable and the design is pretty clear. I'm calling these pants a great value!",
