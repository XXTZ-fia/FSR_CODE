Amazon told me that I should order a 5XL. I am 5’4” and 145 lbs, usually I am a small/medium- so that struck me as odd. I ordered it in 5XL since everyone said the sizes were funny- got it, it was too big- granted, not by much so i returned it and ordered a 3XL- it arrived today and it was still slightly big but the zipper was broken… the teeth got stuck on the corset while I was trying it on. I tried using the zipper when it wasn’t on my body and it was still getting stuck- clearly this one was broken.  So finally, I reordered again- this one I got was just the regular XL since XXL was sold out. It comes tomorrow, wish me luck that the zipper actually works. The sizing is so weird. But the corset is so cute!!! I hope it works",

Do it yo will not regret it. It looks so freaking good and I can’t wait to actually wear it longer than just trying on lol.  I am about 135-145 lbs it fluctuates about a 36c in bras and I normally wear a medium in tops. And I have a wide ribcage. With that being said I was a little hesitant because of the previous reviews talking about the sizing. Ultimately I ended up getting the Xl. It came pre laced in the back which was nice that way I don’t have to mess with it. Initially taking it out of the bag and putting it on it was tight but I could still breathe. I later had my husband help me loosen it a little to my liking and now I can wear it all day at a festival comfortably now.  The feel of it feels good it doesn’t feel cheap or flimsy. The zipper doesn’t get stuck or snag. It’s also not going to slip down one because the zipper isn’t loose but also because while the buckles on the front don’t hold any real purpose to cinch anything in they do however hold that zipper into place ( I tested jumping up and down and movements to see if the zipper would slip and also zipped it down to the first buckle on the chest to see) with the buckles being there even if it was to slip it’s not going to be enough that my breast would be exposed. So that’s a plus. I can sit in it comfortably, my husband loves it, I love it. And you look like a sexy bad ass lol. What’s more to want. Long story short go up one or 2 sizes adjust the laces to your preference. And rock this corset you won’t be disappointed.",2

I even had to adjust the back to make it bigger to actually fit. The XL was way too small. The material is nice and it is very flattering. It is meant for larger/full breasts though. I don’t have full breasts and there is some extra room on the top. Overall very sexy but runs very small.,

Honestly I looked like I had a waist and I haven't seen that thing in decades. I think I'll wear it to sleep in for a while, see if maybe I can trick my body into thinking that's how it's built. Nevermind, I like breathing. Truly it's a comfortable garment. I do need something to check that back fat roll that looms over the top though. I wish they made them where they came up the back higher, with bones to keep it from folding down (I have some pretty rebellious back fat). I'm not sure how that would work, but if I was the kind of masochist who would subject my girth to a corset every day, I'd wear it just to smooth the under-blubber. Mind you I'm not a cow, but there are decisions I would change (cheesecake and gummy bears). Definitely worth the price.

It is well-made, boning is stiff and supportive, feels so soft and durable.  I found the company that makes this and compared their sizing chart to what is shown here. It was the same. There is a bit of an issue with that, though.  Both charts say to refer to the hip size only. To fit a size 35 waist, we went with 5X.  Bust size is 40 C, waist is 35, hips are 37.  We could have gone to a 3X or 4X, to be honest, but it fits because of the laces.  The cup size of this corset is a bit big for a C, even completely tied at the back, so I think a 4X would have been better for the cup. I think if we went with 3X, it still would have fit but would have had wider spacing between laces in the back and a firm hold at the chest.  I'm tempted to order two more in 4X and 3X just to compare, but I don't have the money for that at the moment. For now, 5X really does work if you're okay with some space at the top. The breasts bounce but the cups do not slag! The boning holds very well. It's very comfortable, too!",8
