The length and the visual appeal is perfectly fine and I like it okay, but I feel like once you have it in your hands you will understand. The people I have shown the necklace go from “Awe thats cute! :D” to “oh… :/“ after holding it.  I can’t complain too much, it was gifted to me for Christmas and it’s only $9, but I feel like I would have rather the $9 if I was the one spending the money and that’s not even including the shipping/taxes.",

It broke after 2 wears but if you take good care of it, it'll last a good while. I'd recommend investing in a better rosary. This ones feels like it caters to fast fashion. It's cute in a pinch!

ZombiKandi,Cute but extremely short.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35D0XR2XR91N4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09TK2JP3X,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 28, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"Besides the general quality you’d expect with a cheap gothic rosary necklace, I dare say I’d expected the neck loop to be longer. The chain itself for the neck, including beads, is incredibly short. So short that, while it does fasten, it’s a bit tighter than your average jewelers necklace. As in your average $1.50 chain necklace from Walmart has more throat slack than this. It’s only a rosary in general style, but I wouldn’t really classify it as one. There’s barely any dangle to it. It’s longest point didn’t even reach more than an inch and a half past my collarbone… much, MUCH shorter than an actual rosary necklace. FWIW I come from a heavily Christian family with Baptists, Catholics and Eastern European Orthodox thrown in. Buy it if you want, but for the same price I’d recommend to get one similar from Etsy… otherwise you’ll have to purchase other pieces to tailor it a bit. Honestly, it’s cute in the ad photo, especially cute as far as talismans go for a goth such as myself, but actual wearability? It’ll need to be altered.",

Aesthetically this is one of my favorite necklaces I’ve owned, but god is it fragile. The “hooks” that connect each bead to the other are made of very soft and malleable metal that will open up under the slightest pressure, but luckily this also means it can be closed and fixed just as easily. It imitates a rosary and the ankh is directly modeled after the symbol of Vampire: The Masquerade revised edition.
