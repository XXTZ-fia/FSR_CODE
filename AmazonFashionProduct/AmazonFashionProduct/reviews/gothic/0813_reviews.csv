I called Amazon and was told to return the medium, order the large, and then I would get a refund on the difference.

Either directly from the website or the Amazon store. Vendors at shows hate me because I walk right by their booths & exclaim ""Darling, read the label. Buy it directly from Scarlet Darkness on Amazon & you save enough to buy 2 more or an entire outfit. They have a website too. But seriously, the day I purchased this I was holding it in my hand for $80, passed it to my husband & right in front of the vendor & 3 customers, I purchased it for $23 on a flash sale & showed them all the deal I just got. I understand owning a small business & mark ups on the merchandise but I draw the line where greed jacks the price up to 3 times the cost or higher. I've lost count of how many people I have sent directly to your store & web pages so they can buy directly from you & have the added protection of should they ever need to exchange or as a question they can. For me that honestly makes more sense & is a win/win. You get the purchases & we get beautiful gear at an even more beautiful price AND reliable customer service should we ever need it.

Fortunately this wasn’t too much a problem as my shirt sits over the waist. The waistband does have a bit of elastic so if you were unsure about what size to get, I would size down if you wanted a truer fit or get your size if you want it to be a bit bigger.  The length in the front of the skirt can be adjusted. In the first picture I have it pulled a bit higher so my shoes are visible! It looks really nice at whatever length though. There is a hidden zipper on the side.  I’m almost 5’6 and the bottom of the back of the skirt was an inch or two above the floor without shoes. If you wanted a small train, unless you’re under 5’4 this may not be the item for you.
