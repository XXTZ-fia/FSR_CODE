It was extremely wrinkled due to the way it was packaged, which made ironing it a tough time. Also the see through flowers couldn't be ironed due to the fabric of it so it laid over the polyester underneath in a weird way. It's a beautiful dress in the picture, but it looked nothing like that upon arrival. It was only $40 so ig you get what you pay for",

There isn't, they are definitely only one single strap as seen in the other photos. Anything to know before ordering is the red layer is in fact a layer. You can't tell in the pictures that there are in fact two layers the red layer and the black layer. Would definitely recommend. I will say that the person, not me, wearing the dress is 5' 7.5"" tall wide hips and is barely a 32 B cup. She also can wear a 00-3 in jeans and dresses. It fits her perfectly. We were worried since all the other reviews the purchasers we 5'5"" and under. Worth money, looks fantastic, the fabric is a good fabric, and it is a little stretchy. I hope this review helps.",2

Yet I’m disappointed the quality was not as expected. The straps are thin ribbon like material that feels like with enough pull it could snap. There were loose threads in the floral pattern and the pice is cheaply made giving me the the impression of an almost costume like dress. I am still going to wear it because the colors are pretty and flattering on the body but overall the dress is not worth the price",4
