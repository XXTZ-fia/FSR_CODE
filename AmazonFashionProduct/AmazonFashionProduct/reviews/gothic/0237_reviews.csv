The only unfortunate thing is the second time I wore them the zipper track on the front lost a tooth, rendering them unwearable. That said, I'll still most likely order them again because they're so versatile and stylish!",2

Raven Leggette,Comfortable & stylish,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK66J7MX93I76/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4CV2Q8N,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2022",Size: X-LargeColor: 01-pant New,Verified Purchase,I'm IN LOVE. ✨️ These joggers are breathable but keep you warm and flexible. The chain is a cute little bonus AND gives you the chance to personalize up the style more !! Awesome that I don't necessarily HAVE to unzip them for quick bathroom usage either !! They slip on & off like sweats but look more stylish. Comfort 20/10,2
Tatiana,Not the pants in photo,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RC4LWSBNBJCR6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4CV2Q8N,"3.0 "," the United States "," April 7, 2022",Size: X-LargeColor: 01-pant New,Verified Purchase,"These pants look similar to the photo at first glance but the material is weird, feels like the material men's swim trunks are made from. They definitely do not sit like that on your body. They're only bunched up at the bottom by the ankles and the legs are pretty much straight and they are not flattering to your curves at all. They make your curves disappear.",16
