Terry L. Fletcher,Not Even Close,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RN6Q4PO8INLSK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6VYYKLL,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 10, 2024",Color: Goth-07,Verified Purchase,"This is NOT a $12 bag. This bag is not “made of linen”, nor is it “durable”.  This is a faded out print on a cheap, polyester zipper pouch that would fall apart within two uses, if I were to be foolish enough to try to use it for cosmetics on a trip (not to mention offering zero protection for the actual cosmetics).  The camera on my phone is too good to show how dull the coloring actually is. I cannot even make out the face of one of the two peacocks.  I’ve bought nicer cosmetics bags, in a pinch, at a dollar store.",7
