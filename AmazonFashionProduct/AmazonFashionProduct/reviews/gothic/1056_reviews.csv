cruz g.,Different material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QAN6QHR9EKRS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VNR9N6G,"1.0 "," the United States "," June 2, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,Honestly the shirt wasn’t good. I didn’t check the reviews but the material is like almost a spandex material so the shirt just looks awkward. It doesnt fit well because of the material and the print wasn’t great either.,
On the smaller side for a 3x but decent quality!,It's almost like bathing suit material!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R98C3KFKLDTKW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VNR9N6G,"1.0 "," the United States "," March 6, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I would not buy from this company again.

Analiiese Amaria,It’s purple…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R81DW7SRCX5WU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VNR9N6G,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 17, 2022",Size: MediumColor: White,Verified Purchase,"So the color options for this shirt are black and white. I ordered it in white and somehow it came in purple lol? My camera is not that good so it looks barley purple on camera but irl it is lavender. I’m not that mad about it because the purple actually suits it. But if you’re wanting to order this shirt, I think it’s safe to say this is not a reliable brand. It came in the right size tho! And the fabric quality is good. If you are to buy this shirt you’ll have to wash it inside out because of how the stickers are. Hope this helps!",3
Justin,DOESNT MATCH SIZING,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XHTAAA2E71UD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VNR9N6G,"2.0 "," the United States "," August 16, 2022",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,its a xxl yet it literally hugs my body like a medium sized shirt does.,4
