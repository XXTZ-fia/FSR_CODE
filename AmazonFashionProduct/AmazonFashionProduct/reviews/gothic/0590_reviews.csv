Billie,not even close to being true to size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Z22B9UDTA42H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CFZFP5JQ,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 7, 2024",Color: 8-blackSize: 3X-Large,Verified Purchase,"The pants are cheaply made, and way smaller than the sizing. I ordered the xxl and they were more along an large at best. The chain hanging is a little heavy but not too heavy, and the zipper front doesnt have a clasp and eventually will wear like zippers do on pants and not stay up. I am returning these really unhappy with this purchase because the pants would be cute if a little better quality and true to sizing.",
