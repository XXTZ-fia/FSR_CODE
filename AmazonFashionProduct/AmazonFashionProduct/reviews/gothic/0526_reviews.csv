Just fabulous.",

The shoulder ribbons are sewn in, I love the design of the textile, and the finishing is pretty good.  The lacing in the bodice is not adjustable so buy the right size for you.  The fabric is light weight and needs a much more structure to lay correctly (wearing a support garment underneath can help, I'm going to take it apart and redo the top all together.) You also may need a petting coat, or to apply horse hair braid to get the shown skirt shape.",

The fabric is a good thickness and a little stretchy. Not too hot! You might want to reinforce the ribbon on the straps. Mine was coming loose so I had to re-sew it. It fit quite comfy. I would say with sizing go up one size. If I would've gone smaller it wouldn't have fit.,

There’s a bit of extra fabric on the back of my neck that I’ll have to get tailored, but it’s the best quality dress I’ve ever bought at this price. If you’re between sizes, I recommend sizing down, especially if you’re going to be adding a corset. The fit is extremely flattering for thicker girls.",4

I've tried wearing this a couple of different ways, such as with an underdress and floral print corset.  This will be part of my Halloween costume this year; I can't wait.",

Perfect size; I am 5'1"" and 125lbs, ordered size 6. I can't overstate the quality for what would be considered a costume piece.",2

The pockets drive me insane though. I returned the first one because I thought it was defective, but the replacement had the same exact issue. The pocket on the left side is sewn into the lining of the dress. It limits the pocket size, dress movement, and the excess fabric makes it difficult to zip. The other pocket is normal.",7
Mama T,Love it!

The fabric is gorgeous. It shimmers between black and red. My emo/goth daughter LOVES this dress. The sizing is a bit iffy, she has a waist 30 inches and hips 35 inches, chest is 32, cup size A. 5 foot 6 at 125 pounds. The medium fit well. It was slightly loose in the chest, but not bad at all. We were debating between a small or medium. Still conservative looking on her, despite the little extra room in the chest. Once off, we had to tip the top half of the dress to get the zipper up. When on, the zipper went up fine. If you are her size, you may want to go small if you have the smaller chest. Again, not too loose in her in the medium.",4

The value is fine-- it isn't a great deal, but it isn't overpriced. We all love deals, so this would be GREAT if it was a $25 price-point, but it isn't a problem at this range.  The construction quality feels a bit flimsy, and so I classify this as ""costume"" or ""event"" quality-- not something you should expect to wear regularly or for years and years. This is fast fashion. It has the look but not the longevity. That isn't necessarily a knock, but it isn't great, either.  Happy with the order, and it looks great. Seems to fit true to size, and pairs well with accessories like a waist-cincher, etc.",5

Unfortunately, it's not quite small enough for me, which is a little bit of a bummer. I might try to take it up in the back as I like pieces like this to be really fitted. It also has a bit of elastic in the back of the waistband, so this could be a lot friendlier to larger sizes!  Overall, the dress is well made. The fabric is the quality I would expect from this price point and the construction seems solid. There's an invisible zipper on the side, which is nice. The shoulders are also adjustable by tie, though I've had some issues with them staying tied because the ribbon is satin.  Overall, I like the dress, but I'd like it more if it came a little smaller.",9

I am actively working on shedding weight--especially in my thighs and bottom. After doing so, this dress will look nicer on me. It does fit me now, but will fit better later.  The material is quality and there is a liner for the whole dress. The liner isn't solidly attached, so it can bunch when putting on the dress. The side zipper is a bit stiff, even off me. I think with time, it will loosen. You will still need a bra of some sort. I am smaller chested and had no trouble with this dress. Those that are more well-endowed might find it a bit snug.  This dress could also be worn with some kind of peasant top under, if you like. I probably will.",4
