I should have ordered my usual size of large if I had wanted tummy control.  While this is not tight the style and design do hide my tummy really well.  I like that I can tie the top behind my neck as it allows me to keep it tight enough so I don't feel that my breasts will fall out due to the super low V-neck.  It is well made and the style makes me look and feel sexy.  This would cost a lot more in a store.  Great value; highly recommend!!,

Alan H.,Not great coverage unless you are a size 1 or 2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23VPP712SL9I8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D28R2FZ9,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 16, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Red Roses Butterfly,,"As for fit, it ran a bit snugger than i thought it would...and I wen't up a size!!!  The cut was far different than what the listing showed. The top didn't provide good coverage for my wife, who is larger busted. Also, the back would stretch so much you could pretty much read through it.  The material felt thin (thus the back coverage issue) and she felt like the suit would fail in water.  She tried it, but, she won't wear it in public.",

I do think this price for this swimsuit is too high.,

I have very large breasts, so the first thing I had to do was remove the little pads. There's absolutely no support whatsoever, but it does cover the middle quite nicely. The back tends to roll down which is annoying. As I said before it's definitely a little see through, and it's not as dark as I expected, but overall it worked. I went kayaking and didn't fall out of it at all. I wouldn't buy it again but it's good in a pinch. I did wear shorts over it though because again, the bottom part is very see through.",

I don't think I'd be brave enough to wear this out in public. One wrong move and the girls are gonna be loose! Really makes me sad, bc otherwise this is a beautiful suit.",

Normally I find swimsuits that are one piece a little too long for me because I'm 5'10 but it's all legs. I was shocked that this was as short on the bottom as it is, it fits but the back from my ribcage up is entirely out and if you've got any extra weight going on back there it hugs right under it and pushes it up and out. If you have a really thin frame or a strong back this will look stunning on you but on me, this isn't my favorite swimsuit which is a shame because I love the print. I don't think sizing up would make a huge difference either.",

Thoughts as follows:  Pros: pattern is clearly printed and quite goth, which is different and nice. There are adjustable straps at the top to go around your neck. Padding in the bust area. Has some stretch to it.  Cons: sizing seems off; it feels a bit small to me. Stretch isn't there like it should be for a swimsuit, should be more stretchy than it is. Bust area is designed too low, so it's not great for someone with a longer torso or wider curves. Would be best for someone with a petite, not as curvy body type.",

The bra pads are easily removed, the neck tie isn't too terribly uncomfortable for prolonged use (if you know you know) and for the most part I didn't worry excessively about anything escaping. The bottoms are moderate coverage and the front is double lined. While the top isn't very supportive, it was still flattering. The only thing I truly don't care for is the the fit of the very top of the back of the suit - it hits a few inches below wear I normally wear my bra strap, and seems to fit tighter than anywhere else on the suit. This doesn't seem to add to the top support or the tummy control. Otherwise I really love this suit. Will order in other colors.",
