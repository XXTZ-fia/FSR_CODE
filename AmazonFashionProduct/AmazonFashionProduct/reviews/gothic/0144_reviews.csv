"Destiney ""Lilly"" Smith",A little disappointed,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTGA6IH6T1L1N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P5XF875,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 2, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"It's a nice enough top, really pretty color and style, with a decent feeling fabric, but the fabric is sort of thin feeling and it runs fairly small. Another minor issue with my order is that the bag it came in was ripped open (which could possibly have happened from the buttons rubbing against the plastic,) and the spare button was floating around in the bottom of the envelope, so buyer beware if you care about the button or it ships with something dusty. Sadly, I'll have to return it. Shame there isn't a 4x or I would try it though.",

Sirena,Problems.  Good for a wear or two.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DFCL9RFQS37D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P5XF875,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 26, 2022",Color: White2Size: Large,Verified Purchase,"Consider it carefully before you spend this much on this blouse - details here.I love Victorian style clothing and was attracted to this blouse.  I don't think there many, if any, reviews at the time I ordered, and I see the price has jumped immensely since then.  I wore it yesterday for the Thanksgiving holiday.  Here are my thoughts:1.  Upon returning after the Thanksgiving holiday, I realized there were no care instructions sewn into the seams or anywhere on the blouse at all.  This is what brought be back to the listing. The blouse is quite fragile and I see they recommend either machine washing on gentle if inside a lingerie bag, or hand washing.  I would hand wash and line dry. It is very fragile, the buttons seem like they may come off, and there is a lot of lace - more on the lace coming up.  The biggest problem I see with this blouse is that I don't believe it will last more than a couple of wears.2.  There is a ruffle along the bottom edge that looks very nice in the pictures, but I wanted to tuck it in, and you should pay close attention to this and think about how you plan to wear it before ordering.  This ruffle adds a lot of bulk if you plan to tuck the blouse in.  If you are busty, have an hourglass figure, etc.. you will want to tuck it in, and this ruffle will do you no favors.  If you don't tuck it in, the waist is not figure slimming enough to look flattering.3.  The top seaming just above the bust, which is not easy to see in the images, looks like a 70's western shirt.  To avoid this a little bit, but not much, add the tie.  Scrutinize the images carefully, the white colored images are so blown out that you cannot see detail.4.  The tie is a real pain in the butt.  They jerryrigged it with the addition of a craft type pin, that is not exactly affixed to the garment, and not easily attached to it, either.  The craft pin is the kind they glue things to one side of at craft fairs, only in this case they just put the bow loose into the pin and figured it's good to go.  It sucks!  It took me 10 minutes or so to get it right as the bow kept coming out because it wasn't fastened to the pin.  The type of fabric in the blouse will likely run, and you can't put it through a button hole because it's too heavy it pulls it down and hangs.  Poorly thought out.  You can wear it without the bow, it doesn't look as finished and it draws attention to the cowboy design above the bustline.5.  The material is very, very thin, completely see through.  I got the ivory/whitish color, and I wore TWO silk layers below it before I was able to leave the house.All of that said, the lace on the ends of the sleeves look absolutely lovely coming out of the bottoms of a blazer, that was my favorite part!  I struggled with the placement of the lace just under the collar, had it been higher, I wished could have put it out along the collar of jacket, but it's sewn an inch or so under so it does not work.Once again, for the price of this garment, consider carefully that this garment is not well made and will likely not last more than a couple of wears.",6

The lace on the shoulders didn’t hang quite right in the back. I modified the blouse for my Wednesday costume by removing the sleeves, adding an extra row of lace and sewing the front closed in the middle so the buttons didn’t gape. It is a snug fit but has some stretch so it comfortably fit my plus size, 3X, 50+ inch chest.",
