I don't like felt tips because they bleed through paper, so I use ball point.  I guess there's no fixing the issue of adhesive transfer onto the next sticky, so this problem will remain.

I was deciding between the Oasis collection (that this purchase was for) and the Wanderlust Pastels Collection. I wanted these for my classroom which currently has a color theme of greens, blues, and wood tones. So I decided on the oasis collection. Imagine my surprise when I opened the long anticipated package and found the Wanderlust collection. While I will use them, I am disappointed that the original color choice I made was not what made it into the package, especially when the item description included the specific color choice (for both sale pages for these particular items a given name was in the description for both of them). If you are just going to pick random colors maybe put that in the description for buyer like me who agonize over these choices.",

I bought some of the less expensive sticky notes that you can find here on Amazon.  I had no complaints about the paper or the colors of the ones that I purchased, and at first was very happy to have saved a few dollars over the real 3M notes.  Unfortunately, the adhesive on the other brand was not very good - I was working in my office, going through and annotating some documents, making todo notes to myself and sticking them on my monitor, etc.  Went to get a cup of coffee, came back, and all of my notes had fallen off and were on my desk and floor.  I tried them on smooth surfaces, paper, cardboard, glass, etc.  and the notes still did not stick.  What use is a sticky note that doesn't stick?  Fortunately, the other vendor gave me a refund, which I used to buy these real 3M Post-It notes.  The colors are fine, the paper is fine, and the best part is they stick like they're supposed to.  They stick on my papers, the side of my computer, the frame around my monitor - they stick to everything that a Post-It note is supposed to, and peel off without leaving behind any residue.  Imagine that - they work exactly like a Post-It note is designed to!  Great product!",

Not only are these sticky notes super sticky, but they also come off cleanly without leaving any residue. This is a huge plus, as I can easily move them around without damaging any surfaces or documents. The adhesive is strong enough to keep the notes in place, even on vertical surfaces like my whiteboard.  The size of these sticky notes is perfect too. They are large enough to write down important information or reminders, yet compact enough to fit easily into my bag or pocket. I appreciate the convenience they offer, allowing me to jot down ideas or make quick notes on the go.  Another standout feature is the quality of the paper. It's thick and sturdy, which means I can write on them without any ink bleeding through. This makes my notes clear and legible, ensuring that I never miss any important details.  Overall, I highly recommend these sticky notes to anyone in need of a reliable and colorful organizational tool. They have truly elevated my productivity and creativity. With their excellent adhesive, perfect size, and high-quality paper, these sticky notes have earned a well-deserved 5-star rating from me!",13
