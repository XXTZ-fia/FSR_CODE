Love how it ties on the sides and fits on me, it gives me a nice amount of coverage (I would still wear safety shorts underneath you never know) and i’m so happy with it. Only thing is the strings that tie the sides are very long and i might trim them! Also be aware, you might show a peak of your panties through where the skirt ties, or just wear it high enough on your waist to not show that. Overall 5 stars I love it!!",5

It's shorter than you'd expect and you can see my butt through the back (not a fan) The laces come only looped through the top so you have to untie them and lace them yourself. I also noticed the seems are very easily breakable, I snapped multiple just putting it on (I was able to put it on easily, the seems are fragile) As someone with curves, I do like that it's not too tight and easy to put on. The fabric is pretty decent too, not soft but not itchy or anything either. I would probably wear this with leggings but I think I'll be wearing it occasionally.",

I thought it may be some polyester or nylon fabric that lots of lower end skirts now come with. However, it was a nice stretchy cotton like material that wasn’t too tight in random spots. It is pretty short so be prepared to either pull it down or put some spandex on if you’re worried. The only other thing to mention is you have to lace the string through the sides yourself, but this didn’t take me any longer than a couple minutes!",8
