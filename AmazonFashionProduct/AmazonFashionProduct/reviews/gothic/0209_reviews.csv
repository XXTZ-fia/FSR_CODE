Cheyenne,Pretty But Small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R310JUERXU0HCY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CFYNM8ZH,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 2, 2024",Color: Red,Verified Purchase,"Its super cute but I had to add some extra jump rings to it because of how short the chain was. So keep that in mind if you have a wider nevk or you are plus sized. Super cute though, dont regret the purchase at all",
