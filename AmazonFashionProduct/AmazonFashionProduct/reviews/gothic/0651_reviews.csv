Jennifer,Horrible to lace but great once that's done,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32C93OMGX5MBB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB28JZDH,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2024",,,"This cloak was really frustrating at first open because the red laces on the side were only partially done through the top two or so holes. I had to lace it the rest of way which seems unnecessary, and it was also really difficult. The lace is pretty thick, which is nice once it's laced up, but squishing it enough to get it through the brackets was AWFUL. It was so annoying I put it in the closet for a few weeks and forgot about it assuming I would never succeed.  Then I needed it for a costume and realized it would be perfect... if I could thread it. I did finally manage, but I literally had to use my teeth to pull it through as I couldn't grip the tiny tufts enough with my fingers. I will NEVER be taking these laces out.  Once it's together though, it is really cute! It's stretchy enough that I could wear it zipped or open over a skirt and top and still have it be comfortable and not look too bulky. It's fairly thin cloth so it wasn't overly hot, but was also warm enough that when I wore it on a cooler day I was comfortable as well. That's great because I really don't want to sweat in this as washing seems like it will be a pain!  The red velvet accents are really plush and lovely. I'm not usually one for velvet but these look great. The hood is hugely oversized so if you wear it, you get a nice dramatic draping effect that still shows off the color. When the hood is down, the color pops along the shoulders and down your back too. No issues with the zipper either, it's simple and works without getting stuck.  The length of the sleeves and the overall body of it was perfect for me at 5'4"" and was just a bit above the ground when wearing sneakers. Granted it did still pick up some leaves at the ends when I was at an event in a wooded area, but hey that just adds to the image I think. I'm actually a pretty big fan of this now, and might end up just wearing it around the house or finding excuses to wear it when I wouldn't normally.",
4mom,Many issues. Video review. Pros/cons,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EEWVTQDQH4D5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB28JZDH,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 15, 2024",,,"Pros:  The hood is nice and the silver decorations are OK. Once you get past that, that’s about it.Cons:  this runs extremely small. I bought up a size and I cannot close it over my chest.  Even if my chest wasn’t an issue, this clings to you and would show every little body imperfection.  As you can see in the video, it’s made from thin black kind of like nylon material. Traps heat. Uncomfortable to wear. Can see right through it.  Also, as you can see in the pictures, the sewing is poor. There’s threads everywhere.  Both sleeves had the issue.  I thought I could use this for cosplay, and I am seriously disappointed in it.",3
