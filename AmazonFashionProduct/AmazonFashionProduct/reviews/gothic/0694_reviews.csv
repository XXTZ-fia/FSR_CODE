Bonnabel Nova / Michael Blair,Perfectly perfect to perfection ☆,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24L2TLFOT9GY8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09GPN9TJX,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 14, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"The dress fits perfectly for me and I got a medium, the top is not too revealing and its adjustable with the laces on the side (if u want to make the waist a little tighter) It doesn't really need a petticoat since its already naturally poofy, but I wouldn't mind getting one anyway. The zipper is also nice on the side. And its perfect length for the skirt. The laces on the side are a bit long but nothing a lil cutting and burning can't fix ;B  My only complaint is: there is NOT any pockets. Purses are useful to go with this dress ;D  -♡☆",4

The material is good for what you paid for and it beginner friendly. I was slightly big on me on my top half but still looked good.",8
Brian Atkins,"Very nice dress, runs a little big in size",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DF24HT4C1TLT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09GPN9TJX,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 15, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I ordered the XL first but it was too big so I ordered it again in size L and that was a better fit. The ribbons on either side of the waist can be tighted similar to a corset to create a tighter fit at the waist. This dress is very comfortable. I tried it with a petticoat, but it actually looks better on its own without a petticoat. I only wish that it came with pockets. For reference, I am 5'3"" and 187 lbs. My waist measures 35.5 inches around.",7
Alexa W.,Size chart is a little weird but the product is nice,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17YHFP2IRA08U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09GPN9TJX,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 4, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"According to the size chart I would have been between a medium and a large. I took a gamble and decided to size down. The medium actually ended up being pretty big on me to the point where I could get the dress on and off without undoing the zipper. Which is good because the zipper was honestly a pain.  The dress is cute but it definitely needed a hoopskirt to go underneath it and give it a nice puffy effect like how it's shown on the listing. Looks okay without a petticoat too, I just prefer the silhouette shape to be wider.  The only other thing I don't like is the cheap looking lace-up ribbons on the side. I don't know if the ribbons are meant to actually serve a purpose, like to tighten the dress or if it's just there to be decorative. But they look cheap and they don't really stay tied all that well.",5
Damion lea,Adorable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNK7HQLDKTOD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09GPN9TJX,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 13, 2023",Size: 3X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,Sizing by chart seems accurate. Teen was happy to have a valentines dance that matches their look. Honestly it’s so cute I might borrow it. Wear with a colorful petticoat for filler fun look,4
