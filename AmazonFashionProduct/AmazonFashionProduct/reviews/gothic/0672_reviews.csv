Rocio Jimenez,"Super cute belt that fits my 32.5"" Waist",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HULRHYZCZEUC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C3VTQLSL,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Color: Black 2,Verified Purchase,"This is a super cute belt and fits my 32.5"" Waist perfectly, but the reason I rate it 4 out of 5 stars is because the elastic is very thin, and easily folds over because of this. I can also see it depleting a lot faster than other belts because of the thin elastic. Overall though it is a super cute belt.",

Abilene,Good but limited size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF7BT7B3YTYYI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C3VTQLSL,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 3, 2024",Color: Black 1,Verified Purchase,"Belt is comfortable and good quality material. The hardware is solid and has some weight to it, and the leather is stiff and nice. The downside is primarily that the belt smells a bit plasticy/leathery, and the belt is limited in sizing. I've tried to show the size of the belt stretched and unstretched- I wouldn't reccomend if your waist is larger than ~32 inches, though you could always unlace the sides further.",
