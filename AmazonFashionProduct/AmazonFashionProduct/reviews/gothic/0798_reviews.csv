I wear a 6-8 in most pants, not jeans.  These stockings are very comfortable on my thighs, legs, feet. Plenty of seat room in the back and front.  The only interesting thing is I think these might have fit better if I weighed like maybe 30-50 pounds more? The top of pantyhose I could pull up to cover about 1/2 my bra! I am 5’7” - not short. I will probably have to roll these over maybe. Would rather have them too high than having to tug to keep the seat part “up.”  Lots of stretch in these.  Would like to rebuy in a smaller size.",

The only 2 reasons why this is a 4-star review instead of a 5-star is because the leggings are too long for my legs (which aren't that short) and so the pattern doesn't line up very well on me. I feel like you need giraffe legs to really show off the pattern. My solution was hiking them up as far as my crotch would allow. The second drawback was that the waistband tended to roll a lot whenever I bent over, so there was some adjustments to be constantly made. Even with these two ""complaints"" I'd still recommend this product :) They set a great vibe.",

SR,"Sizes between different patterns, same mfgr & style, don’t match",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G4FEYEXGKNAG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BMPDP85,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 14, 2023",Size: 4X-LargeColor: Kdk1625,Verified Purchase,"I ordered 2 leggings: steampunk2 (black size 3xl) and Kdk1625 (brown, size 4xl), because I was wanting the brown ones to fit a little looser than the black design.  To my delight and surprise, the black fits perfectly, isn’t tight and binding, drapes beautifully how I want it to over my lumpy plus size curves. The thickness is nice and not what I would consider to be too sheer. Construction is good quality too. Since they are leggings, there’s no extra fabric on the seams for altering them to fit bigger but they could easily be altered smaller. The texture is smooth, soft, similar to a ladies swimsuit.  The colors of Steampunk2 are black and gray with variations of darkish blue, white, and silver on the details. For leggings, I’m impressed with the quality of the 3d print. If the pants have to stretch then the under color of white shows through and the color wouldn’t be nearly as vibrant. That’s why I was impressed that the 3xl fit me so nicely and didn’t need to stretch abnormally.  I’m 5’4” and 245, apple shaped and in my mid-50s. I intend to use these for my hallway costuming at sci-fi type conventions and random events such as costuming-friendly festivals & events. I’m doing a sort of dark clockwork cyberpunk female version of the March Hare (Alice in Wonderland inspired). The top will be cyberpunk inspired, the bottom steampunk/clockwork inspired, with trim and hatworks to invoke the impression of the crazy/mad March Hare. But I also plan to alternate for renaissance festivals by adding a bustle overskirt and changing the top & headgear/makeup to be more Victorian/ Regency inspired, depending on the season.  So I was thusly expecting the brown ones to be excellent, and maybe also work towards a variety of sci-fi accoutrements to jazz up the costuming, but no, not with these ones.  While the material, vendor, and manufacturer are all the same, the cut of the 4xl is definitely for a taller woman with a skinnier waist. The waist is 4” smaller, and length is 2” longer! I’m shocked, perplexed, flabbergasted, and rather disappointed in the sizing mismatch being so dramatic.  I’m including photos of side by side comparisons so y’all can see what I mean.  I’m going to have to return them and see if they can have the other same size as what I need to fit. I’m going to contact the seller and ask if it’s possible for them to manually verify the sizing, as clearly their 4xl edition of the brown Kdk1625 style pattern isn’t accurate in proportions at all. I’m hoping this order was just some random one-off mistake from the factory, as I would really like to have this pattern in the correct (same as the 3xl black Steampunk2) size that I got in my same order as the mis-sized 4xl brown ones.",14
