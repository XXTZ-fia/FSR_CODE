Anne Onymous,Warm and can be worn different ways,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9YLB9WE3FY3Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3TD31F,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 6, 2024",Color: BlueSize: Medium Plus,,"This shirt has a cool, kind of edgy look.  I got the Medium plus, and it's stretchy. It looks cool but I can tell it'll be even cooler after I lose more weight.  My 10-year-old tried it on and it actually fit her as a cool dress.  I think it looks better on her for the time being.  The hood is just like a cowl neck or like a turtle neck on steroids. You can wear it in different ways: hood on, hood down, cowl neck, or on a smaller frame like my kid's, around the shoulders.  It's pretty versatile.It's made of like a nylon thermal material, like long underwear, and it's warm. The color is bright and matches the listing photos. The stitching is even brighter.  If you cut the tags off, this can be worn inside-out if you don't want the edgy seams-showing look.It's a pretty cool shirt.",
bridgitte,Shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUDPA469M07RR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3TD31F,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 27, 2024",Color: BlueSize: Medium Plus,,"I really like this costume shirt. It has such a pretty, vibrant color. It's good quality. It fits true to size. I'm 40lbs. Over weight from having my triplets a couple months ago. I can tell this will be perfect after the weight loss. (130lbs) it does feel warm. It's comfortable to wear, although the fabric is not that soft. I'm very happy with it.",
Elizabeth R. Brooks,Love this brand,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JJDTVYGJMS06/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3TD31F,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 2, 2024",,,"The product is exactly as pictured. It's comfortable and looks really good on me. The length is really nice in back because it covers well past the bum, and I like that a lot. Light weight but still provides warmth because of its length and the hood.",
