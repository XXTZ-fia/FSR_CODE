I am 5'4 & I typically wear a size 16 - 18 and I bought a 3 XL based on the size chart and it fit perfectly. So for sure look at their size chart and choose accordingly because had I bought my regular size it definitely would have been on the small side. The cape is it's own separate piece and I thought it would bother me sensory wise but it was loose around the neckline & I barely noticed it was there after it was buttoned.,10
