I have loved it for a year — like, SUPER loved it. I love the oversized Harajuku style shown in the seller's photos.  So, I finally decided to get the black and gray version in the same size on May 18, 2024. When I first opened the packaged, I started to worry because the fabric didn't seem as good as the blue and green version. It wasn't as soft. However, I double-checked that I'd purchased the two shirts from the same seller, and once confirming that, figured that the fabric must improve with washing so that it achieves the same softness as the blue and green version. It has not. In fact, it's gotten worse.  Not only is the fabric for the black and gray shirt still scratchier and stiffer, but it has also shrunk from washing (in cold water on a delicates cycle) and drying (on low heat), even though I have followed the same care routine that I do for the blue and green version. As you can see from my photo, the sleeves and torso are much shorter. Even the width of the shirt seems slightly narrower. I will never wear this shirt because it's pretty much a standard long-sleeve t-shirt at this point, and I have others that are much softer.",
