I am a very thin man, so it’s not like I had put on the vest that ended up fitting too tightly and broke because i strained it, infact when this button fell off the vest was sitting on me a tiny bit loose.

Kenneth Deeds,The Vest is great but the buttons are cheap plastic.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22NGQECSQAO68/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4QLDLZC,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 6, 2024",Color: Red Black Flower aSize: Large,Verified Purchase,The Vest is comfortable and fits great. The buttons that it comes with however are made of cheap plastic. They are sewed on so loosely that they visibly droop/are able to twist around on themselves resulting in their designs not lining up with each other properly which in my opinion does this piece of apparel a massive disservice since they cause an otherwise well made vest to have an almost Halloween costume kind of appearance. This wasn’t a problem for me at all though because I was already planning on replacing them with a set of metal buttons when I decided to purchase this particular vest regardless. I’d recommend this vest to anyone who like me already plans on switching out the plastic buttons for something better but anyone who isn’t interested in doing so should probably keep my criticism in mind.  P.S I have included before and after pictures just so people can see how much better this vest looks when it has a proper set of metal buttons. The first pic is how the original plastic buttons look directly from the seller and the second pic is how it looks if the buyer decides to replace them with a higher quality set of metal buttons like I did. (Edit: For some reason the Amazon website switched the arrangement of my pics around. Just to be clear the silver buttons are the ones that I replaced the original buttons with.),
