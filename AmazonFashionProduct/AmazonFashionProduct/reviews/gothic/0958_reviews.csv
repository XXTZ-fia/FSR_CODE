Runs small though. I had to return, because it was too small. Could JUST button it and the sleeves were short, there is no stretch. Length is good, and could be tucked in.

I ordered it for a Mary Poppins costume but I’ll be wearing it a lot. It fits me like it was tailored, which is crazy since it’s a random Amazon find. The fabric feels nice on my skin. It has just enough stretch that you can move your arms freely without it feeling tight across the bust, back, or arms themselves. The pretty pearl buttons are a plus. The shirt was shipped folded up in a small bag but all I see are a few creases along the lower arms so I’d say there’s no need to worry about wrinkles. The biggest part that blows my mind is the fabric is sheer, giving you that lacy Edwardian period feel, but apparently it’s not see through. I opened this package after I’d already put on my lounge-around clothes and was not intending on taking a picture so I didn’t bother to put a bra back on. I have an olive complexion, so on the darker side up there (sometimes you need TMI on a product review).  As you can see from my picture it is not obvious that I’m free winging it. Okay so ignore my shape because that does make it obvious, but that’s got nothing to do with the shirt. I’m over 50 and breastfed my children. That being said, I can tell that I will have no issues when I do have the girls in place. I hate it when a shirt gaps between buttons and I have to wear a tank or camisole underneath. I live it South Alabama for Pete’s sake where it’s generally 115 degrees with 102% humidity. That’s a big no thank you to layering. For reference I’m 5 ft 6 and weigh 155 lbs. On the regular I wear a 34D, size 8 pant & medium shirt. I ordered the size 12 and it’s perfect  I’m about to buy the black collared one as well.",34
