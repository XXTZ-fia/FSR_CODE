Which is a huge pain... As well as it being too large even at the smallest size. I ordered another belt from them. That is similar but I really wanted the boning.. I wish they offered smaller sizing. I don't see why not? There's obviously a market for this or is the supplier they buy them from just not selling it. If not. I. May just look elsewhere because that's just not wearable... :( lovely clothes but at the markeup high price, not worth it.",

The size table says size 12 is for 30 to 31-inch waists, but I measured from one end to the other and it measured 32-inches.

Also hate the price drop: after I ordered this it went from $21.99 to $17.99 with an $8 coupon ($9.99). It does look nice though.

Only issue is, I have a 27” waist and their size 6 is a bit loose, even when tied its tightest. I only plan to wear this mostly over sweater dresses so it’s not a huge problem, but I think they should really make one or two sizes smaller.  All is pretty good quality. There’s some slack in the bias edge between boning, but that may be because it’s not very tight. I’m not sure what the boning is made from, maybe a plastic -it is very lightweight.
