I ordered both red options (bright and dark) very last minute just to have a choice in case I didn’t like the bright red, and I’m glad I did bc the bright red one came filthy. The dark red one was clearly new and clean, and it worked for me so I wore it. The bright red one was dirty, and looked like someone just took it off after use and sent it straight to me. Someone clearly used it for a costume (it had dark makeup/smudges) and then returned it, and then it was sent to me. So I have the black and dark red now. Great quality, I’m just disappointed that I was sent a dirty used one… (last pic was the dark red that worked great)",

I will probably switch out the ribbons at some point, because the ones it came laced with are not the greatest, but it was for a Halloween costume and worked great. The boning was supportive and it was actually pretty comfortable to wear. It is cut for a slightly curvier figure, so if you're smaller chested, it may have some gapping. I believe I ordered a small and it was laced almost completely together at the top, but needed to be laced looser in other areas (for reference, my measurements are 35-25-35)",

You can barely tell which is the top from the bottom as there is no distinctive bra like top to it like in the photo. It’s just one uniboob. The material that is used as its frame makes it exceptionally difficult to hook the clasps as it is too rigid and will not bend or yield to allow you to hook them either individually or all at once. It took me nearly a half hour just to get the clasps together because after I’d get about halfway through, the other end would pop out of the clasp and it was this continued back and forth. So you really need a second set of hands just to hold one end to make sure they don’t come undone while putting it on. The frame also doesn’t give enough to create that hourglass shape a corset is supposed to create, despite pulling and tightening the laces in the back of the corset. There’s barely any vertical support pieces to mimic herringbone corsets, but it is really just a cylindrical piece of plastic so there’s no possible way for it to create the hourglass shape. So it doesn’t really do anything or look anything like a real corset should. I wouldn’t buy it again..",

I ordered this corset in a medium and I learned that with this particular product that you should probably size down. It was a little loose in the chest area and didn’t feel that tight. Other than that it was a good purchase and I do recommend it. I’m ordering another one in a size small to see if it’ll fit better.,

I purchased a fancy corset several years ago from a specialty shop that was at a VERY high price point, but I needed a different one with a sweetheart neckline, and I wasn’t willing to break the bank. This corset is honestly on par with the expensive one that I own. I bought a large because I wanted a cinch without it being too tight (my measurements are 35-30-36) and got the achieved result. If you want a really snatched waist, you could probably size down. The shiny pattern doesn’t cheapen the garment at all, which was what I was most afraid of.
