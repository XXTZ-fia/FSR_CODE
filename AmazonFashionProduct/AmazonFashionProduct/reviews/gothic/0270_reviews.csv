Basically looks like a large poncho with sleeves. There is no separation between the front and back of the “poncho” and unless you are a size 2, I don’t see how it could be flattering for anyone. Also the material is very thin, almost like a stretchy t-shirt. It is not warm, it is not a cape, and it is really one of my worst purchases on Amazon or online ever! And I have made a lot of purchases. Also, it is extremely overpriced. I don’t know how they can charge $30+ for a t-shirt poncho. Lol.",

The fitted part of the long sleeve is pretty tight, and the seam was improperly sewn so there was already a giant hole in the sleeve before I even tried it on. That aside, the drapey fit of the rest of the shirt is comfortable and flattering, although the fabric is a very synthetic feeling polyester with a hefty weight to it, much like a swimsuit. Just something to note if you're sensitive to fabrics. Neck opening not as large as shown on the product photos, and because of the synthetic fabric, it doesn't really stretch and hold that shape. Larger sizes may find this is also not as long as advertised, and you'll need to layer something underneath or risk flashing skin when you move. Overall quality feels a little low for the pricepoint, but it's a decent piece to throw on with leggings for a comfy and stylish look.",10

I am 5.4 and the hem line came right below my lady bits so if you are tall or have a long torso I would check the measurements first if you want it longer.  I was very excited for this really for the off the shoulder features, seen in the pictures, however the neck opening is not the size it appears in the pictures. The top did not want to attempt to stay over my shoulder. The top is so stretchy I ended up putting my head and shoulder through the head opening to ensure I had an off the should look and it worked. I was able to fix it to where it looked intentional, it will shift the fabric way over so it may look funky, the original arm did leave an opening but you will need to at least wear a tank underneath due to the openness of the style of shirt.
