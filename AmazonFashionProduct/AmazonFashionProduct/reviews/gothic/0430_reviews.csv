Just a teeny tiny bit of stretch, a bit long in the leg for the waist size but you can alter them if you are hard core about that-pocket depth not bad, and the belting things on the side work but you can't hide the extra material from what I can tell (you can't insert it so it is hidden in other words, unless there is a way to do this not obvious to me), so if I get picky about that I'll just put a stitch in perhaps? The gold in the product picture does not look very shiny, but it has a nice bit of this in real life! Enjoy...waist 33-34 and medium was FINE.",

I purchased xL and I felt I would be returning these however no it was correct.  I’m some where between a 36 and 38 depending the item. These come slightly up higher than the waist.  I’m also typical between a 30 and 32 in the length and these fit more like my 32’s  I hope that give someone a better idea.  There are also some side adjustments. Mine are adjusted at the actual width or the furthest the material will give. So there is still about two or three inches theses can be adjusted down (1 to 1.5 each side)  The pants seem to be well made. They are comfortable. The material has a subtle raised print in the material but blends in so it is a detail that doesn’t steal the show. I bought them because I already have a long black jacket with a very similar print so this will look nice together. The buttons are plastic.,9

As an aside: If you were like a smaller person, >34"" waist, find the size that would fit you and go one up, then you would be good. I bought the largest size and made it work. Square peg in a round hole situation. Most people aren't looking for that. They are not 'light weight' because they are made from thicker cloth, sturdy even. Great for cosplay or Vampire/Goth gatherings, but they don't breathe. I am not saying not to buy them, just know yourself and what you are willing to do to fit them if you are not FIT.",4
