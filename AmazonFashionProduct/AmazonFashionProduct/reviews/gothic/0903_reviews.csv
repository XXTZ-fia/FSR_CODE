If you’re on the busty side, you can’t wear a bra, it’s too tight on the girls. The straps are adjustable which is nice. The slit adds an element of sexy and I found it to be an appropriate length. Not too much stretch in the dress in my opinion. I am 5’9,140 lbs, 34 DD for reference. I ordered the medium and the large, the large I sent back because it was too big, medium fit like a glove.",

The package was transparent and had a ziplock on the bag, which was interesting, but nothing was wrong with the dress. The fabric is extremely soft and stretchy, and it really accentuates your curves! The quality is surprisingly good seeing how a lot of clothing is cheap on Amazon. In terms of sizing, I usually wear a medium to large but I sized up, which was perfect. The straps are comfortable and don’t cut into your shoulders. The length is longer than I expected, which I’m also very happy about since I can bend down without not having to worry about being exposed. The embroidery is nice and cuts off before going under the armpit area, so no scratchy fabric! Very pleased. :)",3
