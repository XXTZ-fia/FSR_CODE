Danielle Hoblin,Cheap Fabric,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ODDDR98XWUMV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49HFZJ1,"1.0 "," the United States "," November 5, 2024",Size: LargeColor: 05#,Verified Purchase,The design was really cool with velvet details but the fabric and the elastic in the waistband were subpar. The fabric did not stretch as much on the pieces that were largely covered by velvet. Tried on once and returned. The sizing was also odd. Too small in the thighs and too loose in the waist.,
CJ Pache,Love them,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4KHW4AJBZ444/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49HFZJ1,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 1, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: 05#,Verified Purchase,"I love these pants, so cute, soft, fun and fit well.

Mary Lisi Khan,Too long stepping on the bottoms,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UUBHSTIDH3QS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49HFZJ1,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 28, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: 05#,Verified Purchase,Maybe I'm just a shorty but I am always stepping on the bottoms which sucks because the print is actually so cool ( it has a kraken on it!) but I can only wear th in the house or with super tall heels !,
Petra G.,Very flattering and cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G9J36KHXU3A8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49HFZJ1,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 30, 2024",Size: LargeColor: 05#,Verified Purchase,"These are quite cute, very pretty and seriously I don’t see anything gothic about them except that they’re black. The waistband is just a thin rubber band but I wear longer tops with these, so it doesn’t bother me.",
Melissa,"Love, great for disgusing cellulite",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHVQ0378EB3TH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49HFZJ1,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 23, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: 05#,Verified Purchase,"As someone with a thicccc lower body, this hides cellulite & because its velvet you dont hear the ""swishing"" sound of your thighs crossing each other like when you wear slacks or spanx. So this is great for lookinf a bit fancier or just adding a littlw edge to your looks. If you're thicker in the middle, the waist mayyy be a little snug Also great quality",

The fit was snug but not tight. This is the second time I've bought these pants for her. She wore her first ones so much the velvet was wearing thin. No problem. They are inexpensive enough to buy for her again.,3
Maddy,A nice fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4W2VKH8GEV6O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49HFZJ1,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 3, 2023",Size: SmallColor: 05#,Verified Purchase,They are a nice fit a little long but they are comfortable.
