Shipping was quick and what else can I say? Five stars all the way!!!",

And it doesn't disappoint! It looks just like the product photos and is really well made. I'm obsessed with the creativity of the design, and the detailing of the knit is beautiful. The yarn isn't the softest, but it's not the roughest either, and the bandana as a whole is very pliable and easy to work with. Overall, I'm obsessed! I can't wait to wear it with my skeleton cardigan this spooky season. Highly recommend!",6
