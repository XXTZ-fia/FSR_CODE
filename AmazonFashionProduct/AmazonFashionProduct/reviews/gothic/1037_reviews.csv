Erin R.,It fell apart coming out of the box!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUNZTERMSFWE0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BGNX8GFR,"1.0 "," the United States "," November 18, 2024",Color: Gold,Verified Purchase,"This *looks* fantastic.  I was willing to wait a couple of weeks, look at the thing!  Only that's all I got to do, because I opened the box--carefully!--and a gear came off just as I picked up the plastic bag.  When I took it out of the plastic bag and turned it over to see how it clipped, another gear bounced off my foot and disappeared.  I tried to clip it to my hat just to keep from losing any more pieces and another gear fell off in my hand.  The item number isn't legible on the bag, so I can't return it, and since the whole thing is held together with cheap hot glue, I'm afraid to wear my hat now.  The pieces aren't even drilled properly, so rethreading them with wire is a whole unlikely project of its own.  Don't waste your money.",
