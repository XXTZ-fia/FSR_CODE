NOT at all like the pics. And it’s too late to get a replacement.",
Urban,Had to have altered but it looked great!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVIQKQTT2L8RW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8FD6S1N,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"Had it altered to fit my short arms, but the detailing is amazing! I wore it to my wedding so I altered the arm length and I had the vest part taken off, and used one of those buttons to make a loop closure in the front. Very warm, great for fall. Versatile as you could wear it formally or for a costume. Great value for your money, beautiful color. Originally had to return for a smaller size, but the fit was great otherwise!",
purplejazz,Beautiful Coat,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RPV0SEDS3NK1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8FD6S1N,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 18, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Wine,Verified Purchase,"This is a beautiful, well-made coat.  I am 6' tall and the sleeve length was awesome.  I don't find many tops where the sleeve comes to my hand.  If you are shorter, however, the sleeve may be too long.  I usually wear a 2XL, however, the waist is a bit snug, compared to the rest of the jacket, and pulls on the buttons.  Everything else fit well. i.e. shoulders, bust and length.",3

MSM,"Great Costume, but not petite!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11BD67D6XKVJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8FD6S1N,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 1, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Yellow,Verified Purchase,"Love the color and fabric and it's really nicely made for a costume garment.  I was excited they had petite...only it wasn't.  I'm 5'1"", 140 lbs. I ordered 2 to be sure I'd get a good fit.  The large petite was baggy in the shoulders, fit around my middle, but the sleeves were way too long.  The medium was great -- a bit snug in the waist but I just snipped the threads anchoring the jacket to the vest and it loosened it up perfectly.",13
Crazy Cat Mom,Excellent Tailcoat,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P0HBB0HNNFCV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8FD6S1N,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 19, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Wine,Verified Purchase,"Color seems more burgundy than purple, and that's OK too; it is very deeply toned. Velveteen collar and cuffs which sport embossed designs. Sleeves are long. With arms at sides, my hands are completely inside sleeves, rather than at wrist. Bending arm I can expose my hands, so doesn't look as strange. I think I can shorten the sleeves inside the cuff area. I will try pinning them up some and see ify idea works; I am not a sewing person, so if this idea doesn't work, the sleeves will just be long. Fits snug thru waist, order size up! The waist area also secured with a Velcro tab between buttons 2 & 3, so no gapping. Fully lined. Back is almost smooth fit but because it is snug, there is some tightness ""wrinkles"". If I lose 10 lbs it would fit better (of course) but I'm not going to stress about it. Am pairing it with black dress pants. Very fun coat.",14
