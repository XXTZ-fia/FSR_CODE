Lex,Much Smaller Than Pictured,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R175VBAIRQG6CC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BC24QX1R,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 15, 2023",Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"Okay, this might be on me because the product dimensions are listed, but the photos shown with the product ""worn"" are misleading.  These are /so/ small. I wanted to get them to wear in my gauges, but they can't even close inside the tunnels.  They seem nice, they're just small. I'll probably keep them to put on a stuffed bear or something, but I won't be wearing them.",

That curve is very serious. I had to work to get these in. They look good once they’re in. Overall good quality, design, and weight but just not worth the effort it takes to achieve the look.",
Harvey,dissapointed,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RW6W0QFLNCG3L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BC24QX1R,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2021",Color: Silver,Verified Purchase,good enough quality but the ones I was excited for were the triangular dangle hoops but they arent made right so the portions are off and the little triangle doesn't sit inside of the bigger one properly,
urie,"Look good, paint fades, potential risk of locking",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R389EYZ8OSLHDK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BC24QX1R,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2021",Color: Black,Verified Purchase,They look cool but the paint will go away if you wear them a lot most specifically on the long sword. Also the clamp is really secure which sounds good until you’re trying to take them off and they require a bit more effort than you’re comfortable putting on your ears. This actually escalated and I have one stuck in my ear even with serious effort. Try to get in the habit of taking them off often to just remind yourself they can still open.,
Antonio,Really good for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UTWYUPFDTR6O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BC24QX1R,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 18, 2021",Color: Black,Verified Purchase,All around pretty solid. I'm happy with them.,

Emiline,Cute but...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Y2S4JG6FUSQT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BC24QX1R,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 15, 2021",Color: Black,Verified Purchase,These are so cute... but they will not go in my ear no matter what I do. It could very easily be from whenever I got my ears pierced the hole is now misaligned. But with the way they are curved and the very uncomfortable notch at the tip they aren’t working for me :( the charms are so cute though that I’m looking for alternatives that I can do a little switcharoo on!,
