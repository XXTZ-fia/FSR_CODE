However, it's not so thick that it's uncomfortable. It appears to be well made. The buttons are not too difficult. It does have buttons at the sleeves which you may need some help with depending on how your wrist bends. You can have the collar all the way up for a certain look but if you undo the top buttons you can sort of push the collar down and have it flare out for a whole different look. Quality material. Beautiful shirt. Pretty sure it's my daughter's favorite piece now. It's so good, we used them for her senior photos. I was hesitant about it because of the price but it was definitely worth it. It's understandably a unique style that isn't for everybody, but if you are considering this and wondering if it's worth it, it is.",

The collar isn’t too tight, and the sheer sleeves are a really cool touch. It’s definitely something I’ll wear more in the fall. I offer four stars because it it’s really sturdy and of good quality.

Poverty All-Natural Shopper,"Lovely Details, Including Sheer Sleeves. Goth Staple. Top Button Is Askew.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AJUS3SODOJRU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CD21FLWT,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 21, 2023",,,"For reference, I’m an eccentric Goth that typically wears a teen size S or XS and a 32B bra, I’m 5’4, 115 pounds, and I have the Theatrical Romantic Kibbe body type. I ordered this blouse in a size XS in the color “Black.” Despite being an XS, this top still fits pretty loosely on me, which is fine, since it will always be tucked in, and the length reaches just below the top of my butt. The wrist cuffs fit loosely enough to easily adjust, and I retain full mobility of my arms. While the bodice material is thick enough to not be see-through, the sleeves certainly are, and intentionally so, which is a lovely aesthetic detail. The material also holds wrinkles, so you’ll likely want to iron those out. The pretty ruffles at the collar and sleeves add some substantial weight to this attractive blouse, which I really like. The buttons are plastic, but they still look very special. They’re a tarnished silver color with a crown design embossed in the center. Unfortunately, the stitching of the button holes is a bit messy, so buttons often get stuck on loose threads inside those holes. Otherwise, the stitching of this blouse seems very nice. My only serious gripe about this top is that the very top button is sewn farther inward than the buttons below it, so when this is completely buttoned up, that top button is positioned askew from the neat line of buttons below it. So, I’ll be re-sewing that button to sit more appropriately. Aesthetically, this is a perfect top for any goth who is into period, romantic, or vampyric looks, and it should be considered a wardrobe staple.",4

The Large fits better than she had hoped -- it's loose, but not too loose, and the Medium would have been snug across the bust and belly. The sleeves are a bit long, but then MOST sleeves are a bit long for her. She'll have to move the sleeve buttons to keep the sleeve from dropping over her hand (but, again, many long-sleeve shirts need the buttons moved to tighten the sleeve cuff). (So, maybe, since the Large fits so well, but from the numbers on the size chart, should be loose on her, MAYBE the shirt runs a little smaller than the size chart would suggest?) The see-through sleeves are nicely done, just enough opaque to be ""intriguing"" and the back is slightly more opaque (but still see-through enough that she'll probably plan on wearing a camisole under it or a jacket over it). The front of the bust is nicely covered with the ruffle trim from the collar going down and completely covering the bust area. The stand-up collar and wrist-cuffs look authentically Victorian Era, and this blouse could easily be part of a Victorian costume! She LIKES it!",2

The material is however, super stretchy, which I wasn't expecting, so I guess I can just sew up where the buttons are in the middle and pull the shirt on and off without them, because I have major gapping given that I was expecting a 40"" bust shirt. It's see-through enough in the main body that you'll need a nude bra, with the sleeves and part of the side being totally transparent. Even without the size issue, I think this is a bit overpriced as it looks quite costume-y, but maybe it looks a bit better in the black color.",8
