The dress had some very minor loose threads sticking out on the straps and by the zipper which I cut and burned off. The black ribbon was too long so I had to cut them as well so they wouldn’t drag so long. I like the ribbon as it allows me to tighten the dress for a more form fitting shape. Attached are various photos of when I wore a push up bra and no bra. The dress does not have any cups or padding so if you want cleavage, I would recommend a black or strapless bra. I threw this in the wash and put it in the garment bag because I didn’t want the ribbons getting tied around my other clothes. It came out same size as when I bought it. It can be hard to find the right fit for me as I tend to wear extra small. This one fit very well, would buy other patterns as long as they have the corset like feature to tighten around waist and hips.",19

Wow, this dress is so so so cute. I got so many compliments when I went out wearing it. The fabric is a little thin and feels satin-y; it’s a very light fabric so great for hot weather. I love how there’s a corset-like feel to the dress with the side lacing; you can pull it tight to make the dress more form-fitting or loosen them if you prefer a drapey look. The zip up in the front is so flattering and makes your chest look really good. I would recommend taking the ribbons out from the sides before washing, as they would probably get wrapped around your other clothes and cause a mess.
