Serina,Bling Bling,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IY90HOED1VQ2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2ZWMNV7,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Color: Shiny BlackSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I bought this for my husband for our Medieval Renaissance event New Year’s Eve 2024. He got compliments instantly, along with his Kilt and shoes. Everywhere we went ppl loved his 1625 shirt blouse. We bling bling everywhere we go and he loves it. I do recommend especially for any renaissance festival event. 😍",
GigglinGoth,Sad that mens shirts tend to be nicer than womens.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X6RHVJV73YZB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2ZWMNV7,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 23, 2024",Color: Shiny BlackSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"There is nothing to not like! It's truly beautiful.  The fabric is so nice and it's well made. I purchased it for myself not the hubby, lol. For some reason it's really hard to find lace blouses for women but my husband can find himself gorgeous ones easily. I decided to start buying men's tops and absolutely love the look and variety. From now on it's fancy mens tops for me ;)",
Vinny1122,Beautiful shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RABMDR4YZFLDW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2ZWMNV7,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 19, 2024",Color: Shiny BlackSize: Small,Verified Purchase,This shirt is simply beautiful and of good quality.

Laura Clark,This is beautiful,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HTQ7M6H9NN5G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2ZWMNV7,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 7, 2024",Color: Shiny BlackSize: X-Large,,"Bought for my husband.  The arm length is great, nice quality and details are great.  Very flashy.  Warning, the next is tight when both buttons are buttoned.",
Ben Acevedo,"Goofy for cosplay and costumes, fit tight.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZXWZJ4QZPBP8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2ZWMNV7,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 17, 2024",Color: Shiny BlackSize: 3X-Large,,"The only complaint about this great addition for cosplay for costumes for vampires is the sizing. It's a little on the tight size but that's to be expected for a vampire costume. The material is costume quality and I recommend to carefully wash this garment. It looks great but it's not terribly sturdy, so no wrestling or climbing walls with this. Overall, I think it's acceptable for cosplay. I would recommend.",
Cary,Who wants to be a Vampire?!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROGPI6PZ9WP5U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2ZWMNV7,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 16, 2024",Color: Shiny BlackSize: Large,,"This shirt was a big hit at the local industrial/goth club here in town.  Very well made, looks super good and is lightweight enough to wear on a hot summers night down in the city. (Not so light weight that you can see threw it, but that wouldn't be so bad in that setting anyways.)",
AdorCharm,Fabulous Victorian Gothic Formal Shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3A128614AQYKD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2ZWMNV7,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 7, 2024",Color: Shiny BlackSize: Small,,"This is a fabulous Victorian Gothic style shirt! The 2 button ruffle collar with lace detail is a show stopper! It is a well made shirt with good stitching and a button placket. I say its formal because you could wear this too almost any event and be a knockout. The shirt is semi sheer material with tiny sequins, gold chrome buttons with ornate details and it really stands out as a classic, timeless piece. Perfect for entertainers, Vampires, dance club or the Renaissance Festival. If you want too be a star I saw look like one! I am 5' 5"" 127 pounds and this shirt fits me perfect.",2
Nichegirl,Interesting design for a blingy pirate/vampire,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNLIHUIP9NJPT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2ZWMNV7,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 4, 2024",Color: Shiny BlackSize: 3X-Large,,"Honestly it's a rather pretty design and looks very cool for a rather inexpensive costume piece.  Guys take heed.  This shirt has NO leeway in sizing or ability to stretch.  If you aren't going to fit it the size chart with room to spare, this is not the shirt for you.  Make sure your entire torso is below the chest measurements because it doesn't get any bigger anywhere.  For instance if there is a part of your upper body (belly area perhaps) that when relaxed or sitting causes your circumference to come close to or exceed the size chart, it's not the shirt for you or a rocketing button may just put out an eye across the room.  Also the arm sizing seems too small in the upper arms.  If it fit this would be so much fun so I'm not saying that to dissuade anyone who can find this in their size.  Would be so much fun and dashing for halloween, a rave, a parade, being a ren faire bard or anywhere you feel the need to turn up the glitz.",
C,Flashy and fun,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JWLONDFDG2L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2ZWMNV7,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 4, 2024",Color: Shiny BlackSize: Medium,,"I got this shirt for a glampire costume I am putting together, and I was honestly a little worried that the flashy bits on this shirt would turn out to be glitter or confetti dot. I was SO pleasantly surprised when I opened up the package and, lo and behold, they are indeed tiny rhinestones glued to the fabric! The double layered attached jabot is also just really opulent, and adds to the over-the-top extravagance of the piece. I usually wear a medium, and this shirt runs slightly large--I will need to take in the cuffs to get the sleeve to fall in a drapey, dramatic way. Other than that, this shirt is an absolute hit!",
Cynna Ael,Teen Approved,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1M8TEHW88NMJF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2ZWMNV7,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 4, 2024",Color: Shiny BlackSize: Small,,"My teen wanted this shirt and I was really impressed when it came.  It reminds me so much of Prince that I been singing ""Purple Rain"" every time my teen comes around.  It is sparkly and looks so great on.  The arms are way long on this shirt and that would be the only issue.",

Betsy Bargain,Stylish And Well-Made,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HN6BFMYW6PTI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2ZWMNV7,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 30, 2024",Color: Shiny BlackSize: X-Large,,"This pirate/vampire shirt looks very stylish.  It is just like the picture.  Even the buttons are cool.  The rhinestones on the front and sleeves are sparkly.  I got this for my husband to wear with his band.  It would also be great for a pirate or vampire costume.  My husband's usual size XL fits as expected, but would look nicer on a more slender person.  The product listing says to wash it by hand, but I washed it in a cold water machine wash, in a mesh bag, with no issues.  I hung it to dry.  I think it's a very nice shirt, and is well worth the price.",
