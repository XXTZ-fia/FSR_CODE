The skirt falls to the ankles and I can wear very low heels without the skirt appearing too long. I could wear flats and it would still be fine. I was frankly surprised at how well constructed the skirt is and the silky thickness of the fabric. Interior seams are well-finished and the strings to pull the vertical gathering at the front are self-fabric and sturdy. The elasticized waist is wide enough that it doesn't roll, but not so wide that it cannot be concealed by a belt. It's comfortable and a little unusual in design. It can be worn funky-style with cowboy boots, a tank top and denim jacket, Little House on the Prarie too prim for words style with no flounce at all, a buttoned down blouse and ankle boots, WWI era with a high necked blouse, short fitted jacket and heels or Goth with a long sleeved, form-fitting top, lace gloves and chunky laced up boots. Good quality and versatile- I recommend it particularly for shorter women like myself because it's wearable right out of the package without alterations.",2
