RR,Cute but feels like cosplay quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TPBB1FM8EJVL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C7P33FZ9,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Size: SmallColor: White,,"The shirt is very cute. I wanted something classy and unique for a certain style outfit I wanted to create, but this shirt came off as too cartoonish for me to wear it on the daily. I'm 5'7"" and 130-140 lb range, and size M fit fine arm-length, but felt too loose in the stomach area. I didn't like the way the back ribbon or neck frills looked. I ended up returning, but this would be better for someone really into the gothic lolita style who can build a decent outfit.",

Unusual from this brand as most of what I've gotten from them has been great for my side gig as a ren fair bartender.",

I’m a hairstylist, and I cannot goth out at the salon, but this blouse matches my style and I love wearing it to work with a long A-line skirt and a belt. The blouse has a very comfortable and breathable material that prevents me from getting too hot in the salon when I’m constantly moving around. If I get my sleeves wet by accident while washing hair, I can just dry it off real quick with a hair dryer on high heat. I’ve thrown it in the wash and put it in the dryer multiple times since getting it, and it’s held up in the washer and dryer very well. Not once has it fallen apart or showed any signs of fraying. Sure, the ribbon in the back would come loose after being in the dryer, but that’s really it. The blouse retained its solid black color after several washes, and it’s still stretchy around my torso when I put it on and tighten the ribbon in the back as needed, then I clip on a bow in the front of the blouse before I go to work.",7

(I have this problem with virtually any pret a porter clothing, so I blame capitalism's push to reduce the number of SKUs.)That said, it is perhaps fortunate that I've not much of a bosom.  I've a wide back and broad shoulders which the blouse accommodates, but it's more snug than seems reasonable across the chest.  I think that someone with much more of an hourglass figure than I might be okay due to the drawstring/faux corset reshaping the blouse's torso, but a big-boned lady (I do not mean this as a euphemism, but rather literally someone with a large skeleton) with big boobs would be out of luck without sizing up substantially.",

While it is frilly and lacy, all of the trim is made with a very soft, skin friendly lace; sensory issues run in my family and this passes the wearability test. I do personally think the main fabric is a touch costume, but not so much as to make it out of place in day-to-day wear.  Like most SD items, this shirt is very customizable as far as fit goes and it has a mock corset lacing that allows for getting the look just right.  I wash this in a bag on delicate and it holds up fine, but I wouldn't want to throw it the washer unprotected, so if you can't be bothered with fussy laundry, I would skip this one.",

It fits as expected and is very comfortable to wear.  It's well made and feels like quality clothing not the cheap stuff you buy that falls apart after 3 washes.  It pairs especially well with long skirts.  I have to wear a thin long sleeved undershirt with it because the lace sleeves are see through but the fabric is light enough that it doesn't feel too hot to do so.,

The material is decent and the quality and stitching of the lace is very nice. I have long arms and the arm length was perfect. I got a size MEDIUM based on the chart and it fit fine (I am 5'5"" and 150-155lbs) however it was a little too tight on the chest for me, 36DD, which caused the buttons to pull. I probably should have gotten a large, so if you have a larger chest, I do recommend sizing up one size for the best fit. I like the lace in the back which allows the shirt to have more of a shape and found it to be flattering.",3

I find it a little hard to get the back not to look sloppy. I usually don't have anyone around to help me with the strings, so I have to try to fix it before putting the shirt on, and it doesn't look quite right. If you're slim like me, you'll have a LOT of extra string hanging down and also a noticeable amount of extra fabric bunched at the back after you pull the strings semi-tight. If you have long hair like me, all you will see from behind is strings hanging down at the very bottom of the shirt, which can look awkward as it is not evident that it's a corset style if your hair covers that part.  But overall, the style is very cute. It could be worn buttoned all the way up or the top couple of buttons undone depending on the look you want. I left a regular bra on for my photos, but ideally, you might not want any bra straps showing. The straps don't look too bad if they match the shirt, though.",4
