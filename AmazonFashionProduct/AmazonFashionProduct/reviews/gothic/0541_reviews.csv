I ordered a small and they looked like children’s pants so then I ordered a large and they fit perfectly. Although I’m typically a xs the large fit great! So size is very off. The pants are super cute though.,

They fit amazing up top.. unfortunately i am 5'7... these pants are nade for somebody who is 5'5MAX. I had my daughter cut the seem out the bottom now they are just barely long enough. Thank goodness they had another seem inside. 9 pockets guys. 9 pockets. And they all work. Not decoration. Ill have to post a pic later. Bt they fit the butt great (and i dnt have much there) So if ur under 5'5 go for it! If ur over 5'7 steer clear! And if ur 5'5-5'7 and ok w rippin a seem out the bottom these are great!,8

Ed P,Astonishingly poor quality stitching,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LS7B25D8NWQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2XB8DJK,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 26, 2023",Color: GarySize: Large,Verified Purchase,Cute pants but OMG there are obviously zero quality control standards at this factory. The stitching is so ridiculously sloppy with unfinished seams and thread jumps from one seam to another without any thread cutting or finishing everywhere. These are likely to fall apart after a few wears and washes. This is your typical hastily thrown together Chinese product with no care whatsoever for retaining customers. Not worth half of what they charge.,23
