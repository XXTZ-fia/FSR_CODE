Instead, the shirt stuck to itself - not just one single spot... like half of the shirt was stuck to the other half and I had to rip it apart... Now I have to trim off all the broken threads from the lace that I had to rip apart. I'll probably still wear it, but I would not buy it again - it's a mess. A cute mess, but a mess.

I'm normally not a frilly, girly, lace person but I loved it enough wearing it for a Victorian costume that I considered rotating it in to my normal wardrobe. However, I had one pretty major issue. After wearing it for a few hours I noticed that the lace started snagging with itself in the armpit area, so much that I would lift my arms and have to rip the threading apart to release the sleeve from the body. I probably looked really weird messing with my underarms throughout the evening. Perhaps if I didn't move my arms much, or walked around with airplane arms, or even held them like the model in the photo (which is probably the best answer) it would be ok.
