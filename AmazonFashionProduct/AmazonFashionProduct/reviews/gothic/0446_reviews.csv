Kaitlyn Kauffman,Love it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ST2UAMJKVIHZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B079L5BFL2,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Purple,,"This is my new favorite skirt. It's comfy, adjustable and soft. The zipper sticks at times, but as long as pulled carefully I haven't had an issue. The skirt does attract dog hair like a magnet at the bottom, but that's more because I'm short and should probably get some heeled boots. Bought it for a new winter skirt and I will be buying in other colors.",

So it is a little long but I can get that taken up.  The color is correct.  Comfort and thickness and softness are all good.  It is lined which is good.  Overall, worth the money value.  However, because one side is an elastic and the other side is not, the back zip is off centered for something larger the intended size stomach.  For a custom this is not a problem and that is why I’m still giving it a 5 star.",

I wish I could just wear it around in public and not just for an event. I'd say its more medieval/ Renaissance than Victorian, but you could use it for all including viking.  I bought it in large and XL I'm 5'6"" 150lbs and really no waistline. The skirt has a corset style waist band that creates one for you. It goes right up under the boob line. You can loosen or tighten the waist at the back. I am right in between the 2 sizes. I can fit in the L, but I enjoy comfort, so I went with XL and had someone just lace me up in the back to tighten it. It has a liner so pretty fine wprkmanship, like real clothing not a cheap costume.. Hope this helps!",

Waist sits right above my natural waist. This is rare as i have a longer torso. The corset back is great at slightly tightening your shape. Ensure you undo the corset all the way regardless of the elastic back and zipper, especially if you have hips. The skirt fits like a glove, perfect, but you have to ensure you put it on and take off right. It has a 2nd layer of lining inside, not the softest, but that barely affects the feeling. Outside material is soft but structured and quite thick  Will have to iron the skirt though as it came folded and quite wrinkled. However, it has straighten/smoothed a little after hanging for a few days. Overall really happy with the purchase. Highly recommend",5

I didn’t realize it until after I had tried it on, either. I put it on and caught a whiff of something not good and thought, “oh yeah, definitely have to wash this,” looked down and said, “oh god, that’s not my sock.”",4

I can see it potentially breaking in the future there but will probably just sew on buttons to replace it.

The GOOD aspects of it: I found it very flattering, the material is thick and good quality, and I didn’t even need to wear a petticoat underneath since it had enough body on its own. The NEGATIVE things: the size chart isn’t quite accurate. I almost ordered a M but I am glad I ordered the L. I’m 5’8, 145lbs, 30in waist. When I first put it on, it was tight and uncomfortable, but it did give a little throughout the day, and it wasn’t uncomfortable to sit down in for extended periods of time. If I order again (I probably will in another color) I’ll get an XL and rely on the corset-like back to tie up where it might be loose. The other disappointing part was the fact that one of the buttons came off within the first hour. I’m going to just remove the other buttons and sew my own on there. As for the zipper- my partner noticed that there was an accidental stitch that came from the waist seam that was sewn INTO the zipper. Once we cut that, the zipper worked perfectly fine, I was able to get it on by myself. So if you find yourself having major problems with the zipper, check for that first.",30

You could probably get away with wearing it in the dead of Winter with a warm petticoat beneath it. I agree with other reviewers that the zipper sticks. I plan to help with that by installing a hook & eye, so I can zip it without help.  The fit is perfect. I am 5'1 and have a 32 inch waist and the large fit perfectly and just barely brushed the floor when worn directly beneath the bust. It's also surprisingly nice to wear on a warm day.

Although, it was very long for me. I am 5'1 and 110 pounds. Even with 1 inch heels, i stepped on my skirt. The zipper was very difficult, and the first time i was afraid it didnt fit me, but it is just that the zipper is hard to zip up. I got a lot of compliments on it, and asking where i got it. A lot of my friends also touched my skirt and loved the material.",12

Like a velvety material. Used in a Victorian-esque shoot and it worked great. I haven’t washed it yet so I am not sure how it holds us. Will adjust my review if necessary, but right now I am extremely happy with my purchase.",
