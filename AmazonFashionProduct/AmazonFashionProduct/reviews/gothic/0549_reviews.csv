The fit was flattering, and the material was comfortable enough to wear for an entire evening. It paired beautifully with accessories to complete the steampunk look, and I received so many compliments throughout the event.  If you need a statement piece for a costume or a unique jacket to stand out, this is a fantastic choice. Highly recommend for steampunk, gothic, or Renaissance-inspired styles!",

I was looking for a jacket, but this was more of a blouse. The material was thin and didn’t provide the structured fit I was seeking. It didn’t fit properly. I usually wear L/XL in tops. I purchased an XL, and the sleeves were too long, making the puffy part of the shoulder sit in the wrong place. The button was in an odd place (I’m short waisted). I would have had to do decent amount of altering to get it to fit me, and I already paid $60 for the blouse. I didn’t have time to exchange and I decided to go in a different direction, so I returned it.",

It paired perfectly with a ruffled top (also Amazon) and the look was perfect for a choir event. I did not get a pic, but the corset ties in the back not only added even more fierceness to the look, but helped to snatch my waist since I ordered a size large instead of medium. I will go with my normal size when I order the red one. It washed with no issues and dried quickly on a hanger. I would not put this in the dryer. It took very well to the iron on the polyester setting. I used starch to make sure the slight lift in the shoulders was not lost. My only drawback is that the sleeves are a tad shorter than I prefer, but I'll never wear it without a long sleeved top so I'm ok with that. Overall I love it!",16

I was really excited to wear this for a event but had to change plans which was extremely disappointing. I wouldn’t recommend for you to buy it unless it’s for a costume or one time use but if your planning to keep it for the long haul it’s better to just go with a different brand that will at least give you higher quality fabric.,

Material is lovely, super flattering, has some stretch, and I would recommend buying your size or one size up depending on how you want to wear it. If you want to wear something thicker underneath, (I am wearing a lightweight, long-sleeve, button down in the photo) you should probably go up one size.
