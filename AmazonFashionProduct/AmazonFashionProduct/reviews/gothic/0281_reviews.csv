Unfortunately, it's cut really weirdly. If I wear it like a normal shirt over my shoulders the body fits and the shirring falls perfectly on my waist, but it rides up tight under my armpits. If I pull the elastic down to show my shoulders the armpits are OK but the whole shirt rides too low and the sleeves are so long they cover my hands. I returned it.",2

It would look fine on someone with an hourglass figure. I wore this over a structure corset with an underbust fashion “corset” bodice on top. The shirt looks ok and fits ok, but the day I wore it to ren faire was warm and this shirt does NOT breathe despite what the listing says! Towards the end of the day, I was dying. I wore it again another day that was cooler with a over bust corset and it was fine. The sleeves sometimes had a mind of their own & I will be altering it to add a tie up for them. The elastic of the neckline wouldn’t cooperate and stayed up and I couldn’t get it to stay off shoulder. When I wore it with the overbust corset, I ended up tucking the front neckline under my breasts into the corset and that held and looked fine.",
