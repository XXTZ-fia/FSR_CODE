A.,Fun witchy style,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YHNEMJV41M5R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3ND2Y8,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 19, 2024",Color: PurpleSize: Small Plus,,"Really cool piece! Very unique and different. I have really long arms so the arms were a little short on my but otherwise fit great. I am 5'5"" and 155lbs for reference. The stripe details are super neat and the stitching was done well. One side of the top does go all the way up to the waist, so with leggings, there is still some behind that will show, it does not fully cover or go down past the hips, please be aware. The hood is oversized and imo looks better down but just adds to the cool witchy vibes. Beautiful purple color.",
Cassablanca,"Cool stitching, thin sweater material",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QWQI11XUAB20/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3ND2Y8,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 3, 2024",Color: PurpleSize: 1X,,"This bell shirt is advertised as a Halloween witch costume top, but realistically, for someone who dresses more alternatively or on the eccentric end of things, this is super cute. The material is like a thin sweater and not that costume-type fabric, so I was impressed with it right out of the packaging. The stitching on it is lighter, so it makes for a fun look. Overall this is a great affordable ""costume"" top.",
