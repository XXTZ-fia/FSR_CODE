The material is decently thick and stretchy! The print on it is a little different than I expected, but I still like it. Quality wise there were a bunch of loose threads on the neck buttons and they seem really flimsy. Plus the big buttons barely fit in the tiny sewn on loops.  The main issue is how short it is especially in the back. It BARELY covers anything and if I move at all you’d see… everything. It’s cute so I guess I’ll just wear opaque tights with it, but it’s definitely going to need shorts under if you don’t want to do that.",8

I have a leather harness on (sorry!) but the fabric’s accentuating waist cinch is one is my favorite part of this dress. The cuffs are loose (I have smaller wrists) and the sleeves are long, like it that way. The bottom of the dress rises above my knees about 5 inches and the fabric in the back is slightly longer, which is great if you have a little more junk in your trunk. I’m assuming the dress is polyester but it’s soft and not scratchy whatsoever. I have small breasts so it doesn’t hug my chest, I love that too. This was a birthday gift from me to me and I’m so pleased. Thank you!",36
