Please put the size you ordered to hp the rest of us.👕  I ended up getting an XL to be safe. I'm 5'4"", 175 pounds, 38B and usually wear an XL to hide my stomach pouch & upper arm fat. I'm kinda short, so the XL from China is too long; it's a little more than halfway to my knees & comes up high at my hips. Sleeve length is a tiny bit long but not really noticed. The chest was a little loose which I prefer.  It's a great blue & I love the design with the hood. The material is close to a stretchy jersey and is a perfect throw-on with jeans or leggings, although because of the overly long length, it's probably best with knee high boots.  Because I'm not crazy about the length I'm going to exchange it for a Large, and hope that it fits better length-wise without taking too much from the other areas I mentioned above.",
