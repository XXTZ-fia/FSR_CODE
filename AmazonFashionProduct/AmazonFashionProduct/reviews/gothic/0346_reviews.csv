Cari,Get your typical size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NB3LJTF0Y8ZC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CF9LGJ3D,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2023",Size: 3X-LargeColor: Black,,"This dress is cute. I ordered the size recommended based on my bust size. That was the wrong thing to do as it is very big on me, about 2-3 sizes too big. Otherwise, this is a fun dress.",
Dilly Dahlia,Well made and cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BHECGT1SEEYI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CF9LGJ3D,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 1, 2023",,,"Ordered this because it was cute and I have an upcoming wild West/Westworld party. I know this is lolli, but I liked the look, construction, and thought it could work well and easily be styled in different directions.  I wasn't sure if sizing, but am glad I went a size up. The dress is easy to cinch and adjust with all the ribbons and back tie, but I do think it is true to us sizing. The seams and zipper look much better than anything I could pull off and like the dress is not a throwaway. I like that some of the accents are removable. To get the most impact, you need a petticoat under to poof it out, but the underlayers kind of work to poof it a little bit.  In all this is a cute and well constructed costume or cosplay or base for any adjacent look you are working for.",
