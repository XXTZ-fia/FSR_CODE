20 Ton Squirrel,I got a USED dress.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5KN2I6TEK8Q1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B072JVLYY5,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 6, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Green,Verified Purchase,"The dress is as shown, and fits on size. It is a bit gauzy but not so thin as to be see-through. The lace trim is a brighter green than the ribbon and dress itself. The dress is less forest green as it is deep army green. However, I recieved a dress that had been used, there were deodorant stains in the armpits that I found when ironing the dress after unpacking. I thought I was buying a new dress so this was off-putting. Not so much as to return, I washed and sanitized (no dye leakage from the wash either, color stayed true.)  But, I will not be buying from this seller again due to this.",

Then it shrunk so bad. It went from foot length to knee length.  I’m only 5’1”!!! I don’t wash or dry anything I own on high heat so this was bad. This needs to be preshrunk before they sew them. I suppose it needs to be hand washed in ice cold water only or dry cleaned. For how bad it shrinks and wrinkles ( think crepe paper on roids) it is costly. This has such potential and while still on my search for a premaid breathable and authentic enough looking chemise, I come back to this over and over but the cons are not worth it. It also is not color fasted. So be aware of washing with anything else and the color will fade.",

After the disaster first dress I bought this one was very lovely. The material is see through when you hold it up to the light but not see through while on. It wrinkles easily but is very soft and comfortable to wear. It makes me feel like a cross between a witch and a fantasy character. I’m thinking about purchasing another one in white! I haven’t washed it yet. I’ve worn it both with and without a belt and it works great! I’ve attached a recent picture. I bought a medium and have gained some weight since I bought the dress and it still fits!,8
