The fit was a little too big, I got an 8 and I’m an 8 usually HOWEVER shoe sizes always vary, it might’ve been a fault on my part as I know my shoe size can vary a lot. I wouldn’t say it’s super comfortable or super uncomfortable, it’s the amount of comfort you’d typically get from those types of shoes. TLDR: it’s not the highest of quality but it’s pretty good for how cheap it is",
