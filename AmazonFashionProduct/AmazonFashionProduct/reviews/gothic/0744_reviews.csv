I ordered the L size to match my 40,32,40 measurements, but there are several problems. Firstly, i could not zip up the zipper past my waist, the dress was too tight around that area and above. At the top of the zipper, worn, it was about a half inch too tight.  I ended up deciding to return this dress, and go for the XL, but the difficulties continued. The dress, while being able to be zipped up, was much larger than the L. it was no longer form fitting, and felt a little extra baggy. This is not too much of an issue due to the ribbons allowing you to tighten, but there's something to be said about a form fitting over looseness being tightened, it just feels better. But that wasn't the main issue. The XL's largest problem was the upper area around the chest and shoulders. Zipping up the zipper fully, I could put the full length of my fingers between the top of the zipper and the back of my neck, a length of about 4 or 5 inches. The collar is far too loose, making the upper part of the dress feel very loose as a whole.  Ultimately, I was unable to find a size that fit me right, but at least the XL is somewhat wearable. The dress itself is a wonderful piece, but the measurement windows are not inclusive enough for all shapes and sizes. You may or may not have trouble getting the right size that fits just right.",3

The sleeves are a little uncomfortably tight, plenty of extra room in the chest, the waist is also a little tight and higher than I expected. For what I'm doing with it, this is plenty good enough. I feel like the bottom is plenty puffy enough without a petticoat, though you might want the pop of color. There are two layers to the skirt; the top layer with the ribbon and lace details and the bottom layer which has two ruffles (which makes it almost look like 3 layers.) The ribbon in the bust area can be removed and replaced (I plan to put some light up wire there, will update with a photo if it works). The side skirt ribbons and the back tie are sewed in.",2
