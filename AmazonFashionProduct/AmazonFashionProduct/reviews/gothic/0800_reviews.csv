This is my style bag! The pockets were smaller than I need but the bag itself was a bit clunky. There were no directions on how to switch this bag around. The photos and straps were different than what I received. I’ll probably decide in a week or so if I even want to keep it. If I don’t love it I may end up just returning-kinda disappointed.,

In my hubris I thought surely it can't be as difficult as everyone in the reviews makes it seems. It is that difficult. The solution however is simple. Don't hook the clasps onto the D-rings directly, loop the strap THROUGH the D-ring, then attach it back to itself using the small D-rings that are halfway up the strap. Do this on both sides. I've attached pictures so you don't have to suffer like I did. It seems obvious now comparing it to the instructions in the item description, but just going by those tiny grainy images was not enough for me to figure out how the heck to strap this thing to my body effectively.  The quality of the bag itself is decent, it's what I expected for this price point. The pockets are spacious and it's very easy to snap the main flap open and closed. The smaller front pocket has a wallet chain attached inside as well which could come in handy. All in all a neat little bag(/puzzle) that completes my faerie/dragon look for ren faire.",9

I can fit my iPhone 11, a small pack of Kleenex is, hand sanitizer, Chapstick, keys, gum and a couple other things in there between the 2 pockets and the flat pocket that’s hidden under the flap! The only complaint I have is that the metal design pieces on the front flaps are starting to come off so they are getting caught on EVERYTHING! When they get catch on something they pull further off the bag. This is very disappointing considering I have only had it for two months and now the return window has closed.

Once you figure out all the ways you can wear it, you don't feel restricted like so many bags. The only things I would think that might need to be changed is that, the pocket that rests on you is difficult to get in and you get scratched a lot and, if you're using the upper straps but not the lower ones the lower ones tend to go where they please even if you try and stay them down.

There are no instructions on how to wear it or change styles, so it's pretty confusing with just straps, buckles, and clips everywhere. I am petite, barely 5 foot 3, and this item made me look very stocky. It also kept falling down and needed constant readjustment. The pockets are irregular sizes-- most phones would only fit in the hard to open zipper pouch rather than the flap. I returned it the begining of January, it is now the second week of February and I still haven't received my refund.

Also in the picture it looks like the strap nicely loops around the hips but in reality you have to cross the strap over the other to loop it back so it won't look as nice.,
