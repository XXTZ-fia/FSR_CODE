Don't waste that kinda money here. It's better to go to Etsy or eBay for something like this. If you want to cosplay this could work temporarily. The strap across the waist is laid so painfully uneven and it's hard to wash and dry it without the worry of it literally melting. I unfortunately missed the return window as I was moving when I received this and didn't unbox it until I was settled. I heavily regret that.",

According to the listing you can't really wash it and you absolutely cannot put it in a washing machine. So we need to figure out how to get the wrinkles and fold marks out of it. BUT the MOST annoying part is that there are NO BUTTONS holding the tabs down. There are buttons on one side and button holes on that side, so essentially if you unbutton it, the entire tab comes off. From the pictures it shows that there are supposed to be buttons on both sides. So now we have to either sew down the parts that are unsewn OR relace ALL of the buttons. My daughter is in tears as she was supposed to wear this to a Halloween party tomorrow. There is no time to return this and get another one. So very disappointed.",4

I didn't have a lot of references since most people opt to dress as Nadja, which just made me more determined to pay homage to The Guide! So, I studied what she wore on the show in detail in absence of any other major cosplays of her and the tips that sometimes come with them. I almost had an item custom-made, I was getting that desperate to find something that looked like what she would wear.  It was then that I stumbled upon this great jacket. And I knew the moment I saw it my search was over. It's classic black, as The Guide always wears, but has some different style elements that make it somehow Victorian-Military-Steampunk-AND-Timeless. It can work for so many cosplays and even everyday wear!  I ordered a small and it fit me just fine (5'6"", 125lbs, small chested). It's well-made and arrived quickly. I removed one star only because mine was missing the two decorative buttons on each sleeve cuffs. Other than that, though, perfect!",4

Though I am a thick girl, I wish there were more bigger sizes to choose from since I felt pretty snug wearing the whole outfit with all the buttons together.
