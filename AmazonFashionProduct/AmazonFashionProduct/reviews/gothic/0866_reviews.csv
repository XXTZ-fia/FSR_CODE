The blue dress is an absolute mess, the corset back is drastically crooked, the bows are sewn on sloppily, the back of the dress is gathered oddly, it is absolutely defective. I do not have time to get a replacement in time for the event that I ordered it for, so I will be keeping it, but this dress is very poorly made and clearly was missed by the quality check. Had I not also purchased the red one and seen how beautiful that one was, I would have assumed that this shop is a scam, but I truly think that this specific dress is defective and was missed when shipped out.

Added the bow on the chest pearl and ruffles to the belt and embellishments to each of the bows on the skirt. Wearing a petticoat is a must to give fullness to the skirt and if you can steam the dress it will make the fabric look nice and expensive.
