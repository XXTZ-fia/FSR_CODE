They are shiny and attractive looking. They also are easy to take on and off. I think they were definitely worth the price. I will say, I was expecting them to be a little smaller. They are about the size of a dime and the metal in the heart shape is pretty thick. I’m not sure why I expected them to be smaller but I still wear them a decent amount. They are also very lightweight and comfortable in your ear.",

Quality is ok, I had to bend one of the hooks to get it to stay secure but other than that I where then for a week straight, even to bed, without issue.

Luckily if they're handled correctly it won't cause any discomfort.  I'd say they're worth the money if it's going to be a long time used item.  It's not changing copper and is staying black.  They're easy to close and the thin part that goes through the piercing isn't breakable easily.",

I can’t really see them when I wear them, and if I remember correctly I did have a little trouble getting them on and off as well. Because of that, I just prefer not to wear them altogether. For me, they were not worth the purchase. Other than that, I do love the design and I’m sure anyone else would be happy with them ! They just aren’t for me.",

The metal is high quality and heavy but not too heavy. My only issue was that the backs are weird and didn't snap into place well.

Overall they are super cute and are good quality despite the low price! :),3
