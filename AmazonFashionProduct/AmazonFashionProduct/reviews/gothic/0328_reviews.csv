I am not even sure it is warm, so apparently he would rather look cool than be comfortable (we are having single digit temperatures right now) and he thinks this is Uber Cool. Indeed, since my son has never been interested in fashion until now, this coat has managed to surmount 23 years of sartorial indifference. I can think of no higher compliment.",

The design of the coat makes the seams of the ""coat"" pull when you button the ""vest"" (it's all one piece and the vest is the only way to close the coat) and the material is thin and unlined making the coat sit weird when worn.  The lapels are tacked down to the coat and are also unlined which makes me concerned to release them (I have a feeling the lapels won't hold their shape unless sewn down) but it makes it impossible to accessorize the coat with a capellet or epaulettes which a coat of this style would benefit from.  The vest piece is very short and would benefit from another 5-7 inches of fabric (it doesn't even reach my belly button at the bottom) and the coat does not flare out the way it does in the picture creating a very flat silhouette.  Buttons are cheap plastic and I will need to replace them.  Width size, fits as expected. The sleeves are a little long but overall I am pleased with the general fit.  I'm a tailor so I'm going to do some work lining and enforcing the coat, so ultimately I think it will be beautiful, but initial thoughts are I am fairly unimpressed.",6

My conclusion is this; If you normally wear a Large or smaller, stick with that, if you normally wear anything bigger than a Large, go a size up. I am 6'3"" 180lbs and normally wear medium shirts, so I got this in medium and it actually was a little loose, but not by much. I'm glad I didn't go a size up as most of the comments suggested, though I think they are correct for sizes larger than L.  I got this coat for stage performance, rolled up the sleeves, popped the collar for good measure, and paired it with a dress shirt, tie, and dress pants. It fit my specific application in that I needed something cheap that would only be worn a few times, and thin so I wouldn't get over heated. It was perfect for this, but don't expect an actual warm coat here, its meant as a costume piece and nothing more. This is full polyester, so it has the same thickness & texture as Halloween costumes and dress pants. To that end, however, its excellent! It looked great, my band mates loved it, and fans kept complimenting me after the show. It looks just like a real vest + coat tail combo at a fraction of the cost.  Some reviewers have stated buttons falling off, I didn't experience this even after jumping around on stage, but the buttons do seem like they're being held on by no more than a few happy thoughts, so I was careful with buttoning & unbuttoning them. It also arrives very wrinkly just due to the nature of its packaging, so I advise washing and/or ironing it before use.  All in all, I'm pretty pleased with this. It made for a pretty killer outfit.",

I intentionally ordered a size up given my personal bad luck ordering costume apparel, and I probably didn't need to. 3. The buttons fit the button holes, an issue I've had with other similarly priced costume pieces.  Cons: 1. No shoulder padding- you need to have the exact right shoulder length to achieve the sharper shoulders indicated in the product photos. The jacket hands like a cheap overcoat more than a pea coat.  2. Adjustment strap on the back is not functional, and purely anesthetic. It would be nice to have the option to add or remove width since the available sizes are limited, and would help achieve the desired look  3. Lack of modularity. The jacket is always open facing; the vest is the only part that buttons up, and you're only going to get the front part of the vest, which is simply sewn to the jacket. It'd be a much better value to have this be a literal two-piece.",3
