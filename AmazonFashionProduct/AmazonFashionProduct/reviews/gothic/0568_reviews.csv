I didn’t use it because this thing STRETCHES, like nearly 5in on either side, and the skirt is already a little big on me. I figured unzip, rezip, and it’s fine. Except, even the zipper doesn’t work?! It’s cute enough I am tempted to just remove the zipper and turn it into a seam to keep it, but I shouldn’t have to for my special treat $50 skirt.

Based on this I would say that these run small and you should probably go up a size. I know I am tall, but in no way would most people call this a knee length skirt. The bottom of the skirt hits me well above my knees. You may need to wear leggings or similar under it.  The material is not the highest quality, but it is pretty good.

My waist is 29.5 inches and it's a bit tight so maybe a large would be a better fit, that won't stop me 🤣. It's fabric is comfortable, the zipper quality leaves a little to be desired but I've noticed a lot of cheap zippers on new clothes recently.",

Unfortunately it doesn't fit. I usually wear a size 22 in jeans and 3 to 4 XL in leggings so I really thought this 4XL skirt would be big enough, but no, it's just too small to zip up fully. Disappointed. But it's still a really nice skirt.",2
