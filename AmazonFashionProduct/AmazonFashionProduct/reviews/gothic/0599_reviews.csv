Bethany Petersen,Material is not as expected but cute still,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35KIAOPRE5LSX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BQW8X9NR,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 27, 2024",Size: SmallColor: D Green,Verified Purchase,My 12yo picked out this cute dress for Christmas and really loved it.

It's sized a bit small but that's common with asian manufacturers, Im a 3 in Torrid sizes and I bought the 5X here.",
MARIA Finnie,Not worth it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GAOM4EMLX7DQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BQW8X9NR,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 30, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: C Purple,Verified Purchase,Doesn’t match the picture such a disappointment I had such high hopes,
Catherine and Steve,"Costume Dress, runs small, especially in the bust",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WEYB30N46VWC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BQW8X9NR,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 3, 2024",Size: 5X-LargeColor: A Green,Verified Purchase,"Overall this is not a bad product, but I wish they made it in larger sizes. I bought a 5x the largest they had. I normally can wear a 3X, or a US size 24, and have a 42D bust. This would fit on my body, but was very snug and the upper lace section that was supposed to look like a bra or at least cover the bust area ended up looking more like a bow across my chest. The material is a bit thin. It is best to think of this as a costume and definitely I think the 5X is more like an American 2X, or 22, maybe even a 20. I really liked it and wanted it for a Halloween costume so I wouldn't have minded that it wasn't very high quality. I thought the price was good for the level of what you got. Just wish it came in bigger sizes. Sadly it is going back to Amazon.",
Sydney,Nope. Cheap costume dress.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REHAG4WQB38V7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BQW8X9NR,"2.0 "," the United States "," June 7, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: B Red,Verified Purchase,"Fabric is stretchy and soft which makes it very comfortable, definitely not made for busty girls, small in the chest - resulting in the buttons coming up where they shouldn't be. Bought for an event based on the decent pictures but this is more like a cheap Halloween costume, returning it for sure. Not worth the money at all really.",

Rachael Daron,Not happy with this purchase,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19DT8D137Q3N6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BQW8X9NR,"1.0 "," the United States "," November 5, 2023",Size: 3X-LargeColor: A Red,Verified Purchase,I ordered a size 3 xl and got a dress that I would call a medium.  Maybe cause it's made in China and they have no idea what a 3 xl should look like.  Hope I can find someone who wants it.,
