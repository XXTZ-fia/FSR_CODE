Jess,I. Love. This. Dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28GE6DHNO521L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3CVJL6,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 24, 2024",Color: Red_1Size: 2X,Verified Purchase,"I was looking for something fun to wear to dinner with my husband for our anniversary, and this dress exceeded my expectations. Having purchased Rose Gal clothing items before, I already loved their unique designs and affordability, so I was excited to try this one.  When ordering, I followed the advice of other customers and chose a size slightly smaller than my measurements on the sizing chart. It turned out to be the right decision! The dress fit me perfectly and is incredibly comfortable—definitely a new favorite in my closet.  Shopping for new clothes is one of my least favorite things to do, especially since many companies don’t cater well to plus-size bodies. However, I’m happy to report that Rose Gal has never disappointed me. This dress is stylish, flattering, and made me feel confident for our special night out. If you're looking for fun, affordable pieces that fit well, I highly recommend checking out Rose Gal!",
Kelly L.,Literally LOVE this dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGOKDVPJVJ0OD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3CVJL6,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 26, 2024",Color: Red_1Size: 2X,Verified Purchase,"It's perfect. Fits well, beautiful, and super comfortable.",
A.,"Beautiful gothic fabric look, runs big",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OOE8B7QTTH2Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3CVJL6,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 19, 2024",,,"I love the way the lace overlay looks on this dress! The inner layer is a standard black shiny kind of poly, not that super cheap swim material or anything but very much a poly. The overlay though is soft lace type material with velvet flowers and is so lovely! The straps are nice and wide to hide bra straps and it fits pretty well. It does look better with a belt since it doesn't cinch around the waist too tightly, I styled it with a corset type belt and added a petticoat underneath. The color is gorgeous and a beautiful deep gothic red. The dress does run big, I probably could have gotten the small plus, this is medium plus and I am 155lbs and 5'5"" for reference. Length on me goes just over the knees and the top is flattering without being too revealing.",8
