The material is like a sweatshirt or hoodie but I dont mind, its very comfortable and moves well, not stiff! I like the length and long sleeves and hood!!!! People were complaining about the sleeves being too long but I dont think so! They are perfect. I decided to order one size bigger and Im glad I did! It fits and is just a little snug! One thing i dont care for is the design of the zipper. Its unique for sure but its kind of a pain to get into! Overall, I do like it!",

I will probably be able to wear it most of the year (Spring/Fall/Winter) in Colorado, except on the very coldest days. My only complaint is that it's difficult to get the zipper started at the bottom, and I worry the zipper will break. Otherwise, it's absolutely perfect.",

The metal embellishments are tasteful and really cute. The lace-up back is both aesthetically pleasing, and practical, making the coat adjustable in terms of how form-fitting you would like it to be. It is indeed full length. I'm 5'8"", and it comes all the way down near my ankles. The hood is deep and covers head adequately. It IS sweatshirt material, so it's on the lighter side, but due to the full length, and long sleeves that hit around mid-hand, it has a cozy feel, but room enough for a sweater underneath. I was definitely pleasantly surprised by this coat!",

HOWEVER, you really have to watch the sizing. I thought I'd ordered the right size and it was perfect in every way (hem and sleeve length, shoulder fit, etc.) but the waist was way disproportionate and the coat couldn't even be zipped up.  I was going to reorder two sizes up, but it wouldn't be arriving until February. Then I found another Amazon seller who had the same one (for $10 more) and I could get the size I wanted. BEWARE! This second coat was nothing like the first one. Poor quality, flimsy fabric and sizing? Unbelievable. Not only was the waist area (barely) bigger, the coat now dragged on the floor and the sleeves were about 6 inches too long.  So the first coat would have gotten five stars but for the sizing, while the second coat would get zero if I had that choice.",6

This Jacket is fire! What is there not to like besides the sizing? I had to order a XXL. Glad I did because it literally fits perfect. My upper body is small. I can wear a small sweatshirt but prefer medium or large. I wish other countries would just go with US sizing it would be so much easier.  I took off one star for sizing otherwise I have zero complaints & get tons of compliments. I’m buying another as a gift.,3

It is very long, a bit too long for me (I'm about 5'3"" and it was almost touching the floor), so I had to sew it to take off about 5 inches from the bottom, but if you're on the taller side, you won't need to worry about it. I love the double zipper since you can zip up only a small portion if you want to. It feels very sturdy and is warm. I would recommend this for daily wear and for a costume.",2

It reminds me of the maxi coat I lived in during the 70s in high school!! I may remove a couple of the metal rings - especially on the sleeve cuffs - to ""tamper"" down the youthful touches, but in the meantime, they are long enough to roll up once and tuck inside... I did notice thumb holes but they are placed so high, you'd have to have shorter arms than I do (at 5'8"") to use them comfortably... Otherwise, I feel SO feminine and flowy in this coat - like out of time and in a romantic period somewhere. It is made of sort of a fleece but not ""fluffy"" if that makes sense - like a sweatshirt fabric, but thicker/heavier. It is NOT for rain or heavy winter season - but with a skinny cardigan inside, it is warm enough for fall - and COZY!! The shape form-fits so it is EXTREMELY flattering - the ONLY part that is a *bit* off is the hemline is stiff, but I'm hoping that will soften with time/age. I am really loving this coat - It is perfect to wear with maxi sweaters, dresses, or a skinny pair of jeans with tall boots - it is the perfect topping to most any outfit! ...And the lace-up back is DIVINE!!",4

I live in Texas. It sometimes gets cold here, but for the most part the weather cannot make up its mind. This sweater has extra long arms. It is like this on purpose from what I can tell since there seem to be thumb holes in the sleeves. I can only fit my thumbs through 1 of the thumb holes, the other is too small (and I have a petite bone frame). It is comfortable, and very easy to move around it. I also have a thin knee length jacket that fits underneath this one. When it is really cold, I just layer up and have no problems.  Side note: I have dark brown hair, and really dark sunglasses. When I walk into work wearing this and my glasses, my coworker calls me Trinity.",
