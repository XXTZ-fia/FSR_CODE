Because it's so short, we alter it to fit. Count the flounces. There are four flounces, the original picture shows the last flounces twice the length going to the floor (maxi). On the actual skirt, the underskirt layer is four inches too short so one flounce is hidden under another and all flounces are the same length. The new picture with a model shows how short it is, tea-length, you can only see three of four flounces. Some people are shorter and some people like it short. PLEASE put the length back in and sell two lengths: regular and maxi. I'm sick of adding three inches to the underskirt. Good fabric, great construction, unfinished design. The longer last flounce is so far superior, but doesn't reflect actual product at all. Your mfg'r screwed it up.",4

Emma,Should the ruffles be in the front or back?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNVNUD9KI5KDN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D69TSMX5,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 11, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,The ruffles go in the back. The label in the skirt should be in the back when you wear the skirt. The only reason that they show the ruffles in the front is because they want to display the ruffles. They should clarify the advertising of the photos and show front and back.,5

I bought this with hope that the sizing was remotely accurate. I did a 2x and my women's 18 body fit nicely & easily with space to spare. What I liked about it is it's long enough that you could pull it up where you need to (If you're only five four like me I pulled it up to my rib cage) to make it shorter... or you can let it lay right above your hips so it's longer. I also like that the gathering for tufts on the outer layer can be gathered shorter or longer. Overall everything is sewn together very well. I don't recall the name of the brownish color that I purchased this in but it is far better than black because it's a lot more versatile. The brown is a very pretty tone. I dressed up for a Victorian float. I also purchased on here a non-hoop poofy slip skirt to go under it. The fabric is not pithy. It had no significance smell so I didn't have to wash it or dry clean it before using it. And while, like some people complain about the wrinkles it was wrinkly, I let it hang for a week before using it and I didn't care about the wrinkles. I sense this particular costume skirt will last me for the rest of my life whether I dress for summer at a reenactment, or Christmas time or if I am being an attendee at a Victorian funeral. I highly recommend it and have given the link to two other women who have also bought it.",37

It has lots of stretch, kept me decently warm, looked great and was functional. The tag was sewn into the skirt backwards, but that doesn't really affect its look or function. I'm 5'2, 120 lbs and I got a medium thinking that tucking a shirt in might require a little more room, but it was almost too loose. The skirt has a bit of weight to it, so since it was loose enough on my waist, I kept having to adjust it. I could have gotten a small for sure and still been comfortable. As a 5'2 female, this was not dragging on the ground when I wore it at my natural waist. I'm glad I got this skirt. It helped take my costume to the next level!",
