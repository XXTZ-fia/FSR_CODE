Rachel,Another rosegal disappointment,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMDB6QJNXYA9U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3MHHSZ,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 31, 2024",Color: Black_5Size: 5X,,"This dress runs slightly smaller than other dresses I own from this brand, but it's still too big. The cinched skirt, and corset style waist help save it a little, and make it more adjustable. It's still just all over the place to be honest. It's definitely very gothy or even costumey, but not unwearable. So it would be great for a Halloween costume or goth night. It's not really ren faire at all. Unfortunately 2 of the string hooks that help hold the corset ribbon arrived already broken, so that was disappointing. Hoping my next order from this brand fits better!",
Nawora,More of a costume than a dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I21FXDI75VC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3MHHSZ,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2023",Color: Black_5Size: 3X,,"Upon arrival I was kind of surprised.  I didn't remember ordering a Halloween costume.  Looking through my reviews I realized it was the ""dress"" I had ordered. It's very much costume like from the material to the stitching.  True to size but thin and shapeless.  I definitely would not wear this as a dress at all.",10
