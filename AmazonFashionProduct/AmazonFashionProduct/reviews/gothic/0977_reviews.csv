Dave,"Great look, material too thin",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NS6HCKBAJR3D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC38B76N,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2024",Color: Black_5Size: 2X,Verified Purchase,"This product was great for a quick costume look that my wife wanted, our only gripe is that the material was so thin that her legs were absolutely eaten alive by mosquitos, as we live in a humid climate.  Great pants, don't wear outside for long if you know mosquitos are around.",
Dej Ortiz,Material not what I expected😫,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R320SG4FVJDK53/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC38B76N,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 23, 2024",Color: Black_5Size: Large Plus,Verified Purchase,Way too big😩,
Gabrielle,mixed feelings.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RPHJZASJXY0T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC38B76N,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 10, 2024",Color: Black_5Size: 1X,,They're super stretchy and fit ok. They are cute. The material is not the best. I only say that because they remind me of costume material or some other stretchy material. They're cute for a look every now and then but I can't see myself gravitating towards these for a serious look.,
Ashley Decock,So soft,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XB2R4POP2D9S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC38B76N,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 3, 2024",Color: Black_5Size: Large Plus,Verified Purchase,These pants are so soft and comfortable I love the flare and the tie up they were easy breathable for a hot sweaty night in Texas at a concert. Fit big and are really long had to pin them up but otherwise great pants so soft and comfortable all I can say!!,4
tfordyce,"Runs big, wavy seams",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1W625RZCP0DXN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC38B76N,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 1, 2024",Color: Black_5Size: 3X,,"Material is light and comfortable.  Waistband is 1"" elastic, which is a bit small for comfort to me.  Sizing is big.  I recommend sizing down.  Seaming is wavy and uneven in places, particularly around the hems.  Not bad otherwise.",3

Diana Merville,Very thin flimsy material with NO compression!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13DLIPYT0L20C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC38B76N,"2.0 "," the United States "," March 14, 2024",Color: Black_5Size: 1X,Verified Purchase,"I was disappointed when these pants arrived to see that they are made of a very thin, flimsy, slick polyester type material, like the cheap stuff you see in Halloween costumes. They don’t have any compression fit at all, not like leggings, so they are loosefitting and show every bulge and crease. They might only be usable if I double layer them with a pair of compression tights below them.  Also, they are VERY long. I am almost 5‘7“, and the hem drags on the ground up below the tops of my feet, but for my purposes, using them as a costume for a horse pageant (where you need the length to fully go down to your heel), the length is great for that, but probably not just for walking around in unless you’re wearing very tall heels. I’m seriously thinking about returning them, because they’re such a cheap thin material.",3
UGA_GURL4LIFE,Beautiful pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PHUTABSE8CLP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC38B76N,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 28, 2024",Color: Black_5Size: 4X,Verified Purchase,Love these pants... however the run really big,
Ashley A Kravatz,Soooo soft,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OKMX28DI40QH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC38B76N,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 27, 2024",Color: Black_5Size: 1X,Verified Purchase,"I love these leggings/pants. For me as a bigger woman I have issues with anything form fitting showing every roll and dimple. But these pants made me feel amazing they are soft and a light material. They are VERY long. I am 5'4"" and I wear these with a 3"" heel and they are only maybe an inch off the ground if that. I would not recommend wearing these with flats if you are going to walking on any smooth surface you WILL fall. Over all 5 stars 10 out of 10",2

Red Queen,Slimming! Glamorous!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OC7V8HR5X5YQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC38B76N,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 22, 2023",Color: Black_5Size: 2X,,I ordered it a size too big because I'm used to Rose Gal being tight on me. So they are a little loose on me. But they still fit beautifully. Be sure to adjust the ties on the sides or they will drag under your feet!! I felt like I lost weight wearing these!!,
K. Rowe,A Bit Long,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LQA364Y1AYST/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC38B76N,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 14, 2023",Color: Black_5Size: 3X,,"A little too long for me, but fits well otherwise. Very comfortable and the pockets are a good size. I'm hoping the length will improve after washing, because I really want to love these!!!",
