Right from the beginning, the dress exuded a charming vintage appeal, reminiscent of classic summer gatherings and elegant soirées. The spaghetti straps added a touch of femininity, while the swing design allowed for graceful movement. She felt comfortable and free, which is essential for any grad celebrating such an important milestone. One of the standout features of this dress is, of course, the pockets! They were a delightful surprise, perfect for storing small essentials, like her phone and lipstick, without taking away from the dress’s elegant silhouette. The fabric quality impressed us, as it was soft yet structured, allowing the dress to maintain its shape throughout the day. In terms of fit, it was true to size and flattered her figure beautifully. The vintage-inspired patterns offered a variety of options, making it easy for her to choose a dress that matched her personality perfectly. Overall, the GOOBGS cocktail dress not only made my daughter look stunning, but it also provided the comfort and practicality needed for graduation festivities. If you’re looking for a stylish and functional option for a special occasion, this dress deserves a spot on your list!",

I’m so glad I tried one more! I’m usually size XL, but ordered an XXL to be on the safe side and I’m glad I did. The smocking on the back really helps it fit a variety of bust sizes. The length is great! It goes down to my knees, so I can wear bike shorts with it. I’m 5’3 for reference. I slipped it on overhead before realizing there’s a side zipper, which is just an added bonus for easy on and off. My notes: I wish the straps were adjustable. The bodice is a nice, modest fit so I don’t feel like I’m at any risk of spillage, but it would have been a nice tough. The fabric is not the best quality, but I didn’t expect it to be. It wrinkles easily and will definitely need ironed or steamed before first wear. The pockets bulge out a bit due to my large hip region, and I saw some other reviewers mention the same issue. Since this is for an event, though, it will work and I’m also just grateful for pockets in general.",13
