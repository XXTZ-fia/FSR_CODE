michele,Beautiful and well made- worth the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FJJ3G2PJINXO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8TGH8RL,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Black,,"Medium.  Size accurate.  I bought this dress for an Edgar Allan Poe Speakeasy event. It is perfect!  I wear size 6-8 in most pants/ dresses.  At time, tops can be tricky due to my chest (34DDD) but typically small- medium depending on the cut.  A medium in this dress fit me perfectly.  I am petite (5'1) so the length is long but nothing 4"" heels can't fix.  It is a beautiful dress and well made.",
Evie Danecki,Gorgeous but way too large for me.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VSU9TB33FN2Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8TGH8RL,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I am 5ft4"" 130lbs, I needed to size down. But the dress is absolutely gorgeous! Velvet feeling, ornate, the beading is gorgeous!",
Ari macris,1st amazon review ever,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14276V8IJC9D9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8TGH8RL,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 9, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Never written a review before but I had to cuz this dress makes me so happy. The quality is really impressive, the fabric has a great weight to it that makes the dress look elegant and legit and it feels so nice to wear! I am 5'1"" so it was super long but I just borrowed little straps to hold it up higher and that was perfect. Wore it to the renaissance festival where it was really cold and the dress kept me warm. Perfect for cold weather occasions",2
S. R. Manteufel,Victorian Gothic perfection!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NJ1NAW6G61B3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8TGH8RL,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 27, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"(5'7"" and 158 lbs, size Large) It's a great fit, hugs the curves but not too tight. Wonderful style exactly as shown. And best of all, can be folded or even rumpled up and it doesn't crease the fabric since it's velvet. A little pricey, like most things nowadays, but worth it for me since I write Gothic fiction and this will be my go-to gown in the fall for my in-person signings.",3
TheRaconteuse,Buy it!!! Just buy it bigger!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHEFRM3MGVGLN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8TGH8RL,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 24, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Runs a good size small (I'm a US size 6 and the medium was way too tight in the arms/chest). But the quality was absolutely stellar. The dress weighs several pounds, so it's very high quality. I just ordered two sizes, so I will update when they come in.  Best seller experience I've had on Amazon in the decades I've been shopping!",3
