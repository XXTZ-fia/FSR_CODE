Kat,"It’s fine, you definitely get what you paid for",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA7K45GHZEFGB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9XWS5SP,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Color: BlackSize: X-Small,Verified Purchase,"I bought this dress knowing the quality wouldn’t be great due to the price but decided to buy it anyway. I bought a XS which fit well and is stretchy too (I am 5’6,120lbs) except the waist wasn’t as cinched in like the model’s pic. You can expect forever 21 type of quality and know you get what you paid for so maybe only expect to wear this once or twice. As you can see in the pics, the sewing can be off in the straps, so you have to keep readjusting it otherwise it looks like this.",3

A little gappy at the shoulders. Is thin but doesn’t seem to be too fragile. Maybe could have gotten a medium if you want a tighter fit since it’s stretchy,
toomanymuses,Loved it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12XWXSDWODQ76/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9XWS5SP,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 11, 2024",Color: PurpleSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,Fit was great!,

It's very pretty and doesn't look cheap - BUT - it does seem flimsily made, and I predict it wouldn't last with a lot of wear - especially the sheer top.  You definitely would not want to put this in the wash.  For the price, if you are not looking for a staple in your closet, this is a great buy.",2

I was skeptical because of the price tag but was actually surprised at the quality when it arrived. It's pretty stretchy and comfy. For reference, I got the size small, I'm 5'0"", around 125 lbs, and it reached my shins. I probably could have gotten the XS but the small fits pretty well. Overall happy with my purchase!",3

"""thomasinac""",Classy with a goth edge; I'm one happy femme! (Suggest sizing down for tighter bodycon fit.),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1I37MCOABW9TL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9XWS5SP,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 26, 2024",Color: BlackSize: X-Large,,"As a mature lady with some edge, it's honestly not easy to find that goth vibe that's true to my heart while still wearing stuff that's right for my body and doesn't shout ""hot topic."" This dress is IT. And since it's just a simple pull-on one-piece stretch dress, it's like shockingly unfussy for something that looks so good.  Ran a little on the large side. I ordered according to the size chart, but I'm happy with a looser fit. Because it's so stretchy you could probably size down if you want a super-tight bodycon look. Even if you're kind of self-conscious about your shape, the design is so flattering it's almost ridiculous.  Somehow with the strategically placed underslip layer plus the high neck collar and mesh outer layer it manages to be both sexy and modest at once? Very femme and attractive but keeps it classy. With the right accessories this could work for a wedding guest level of formalwear, but is way more comfortable and effortless to wear than most dresses like that. Plus it's actually decent for warm weather. My friends do an annual cemetery picnic in June and this is the look I'll be wearing next time I join them, because it's summery and flirty for daytime wear but also has that dark edge.  It is hand wash and drip dry only, which could be annoying for some folks. It isn't a problem for me since I do that with most of my lingerie and many of my vintage pieces already. I think the ease of wearing it and feeling so pulled together so quickly makes up for a little extra effort on the laundry side.  It's not luxury fabric or anything, but the look lives up to the item listing photos completely and honestly I think it's a fantastic value for the price. I thought I was just getting a quick affordable rag for a party, but this way exceeded my expectations.",20
