Belt isn’t as much help, doesn’t mention it’s actually a Velcro belt in the back so you can’t use it like a corset as you might assume like I did as tightening it is a struggle since the Velcro  would just start to separate. Wasted my money in my opinion",

The color 5☆ As described and shown 5☆ Shipping time 4☆ Fit 4☆ I wish the straps were adjustable because the built-in cups are a little loose and fall slightly. I'm going to a wedding and will have to be carefully about not having a nip-slip moment 🤣 The only other issue I have was the belt that was included in with the dress. It isn't elastic like the other corset waist belt that I have bought from Amazon- its velcro. I could look past this however, if the belt didn't run slightly larger than normal. I laid the pieces together so they fit together fully on each end and the belt was loose around my waist. I tried to make it tight bit since this was made with velcro there was the extra material that was not attached hanging off and was actually causing the velcro that I did have connected to separate. So I decided to not wear the belt today and also because I can't find my other belt. Look 5☆ this is such a cute dress!!  Overall the dress is cute and what I wanted. The little bow in the front is so adorable and the lace isn't scratchy AT ALL 🤩 which is a huge thing with me because I cannot STAND stiff scratchy lace work.  When I wear this dress again I'll definitely use another belt.",5
