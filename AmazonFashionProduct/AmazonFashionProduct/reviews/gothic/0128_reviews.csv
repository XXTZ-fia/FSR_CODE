Jennifer,"Cute, but i had to butcher it. (DIY)",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36PSYJX70AYA4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C73BNL6K,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Blackwhite,Verified Purchase,"I didn't like the inbuilt corset. Not like a corset at all. Well, it's like a halloween costume corset which given the price is expected. I didn't like it under a normal corset so I cutit off.  Cuts off well, is only attached in a vertical piece so just cut it close to the seam and you can just wear a better corset and still enjoy the cuteness.",

Tami R.,Runs small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38R39NI1G0WW8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C73BNL6K,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Purpleblack,Verified Purchase,The dress is ok quality. It runs small in the waste area where the belt is. The actual dress fit fine but looked horrible due to the belt being too small and the tie being too short for the size. I had to skip every other hole so I could secure the tie.,

Alexandria,Cute and true to size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UBZPBRQE0DZX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C73BNL6K,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 13, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Exactly as pictured. I was impressed with the quality of the fabric , I expected it to feel cheap but it was actually very nice for the cost. It was true to size , comfortable, had plenty of stretch, and fit me well. It also had a hidden cinching string inside of the lining to help alleviate tension to the built in corset. Which was actually the only real issue I had with the dress. The ‘boning’ felt like it was made out of zip ties. I would have preferred a slightly firmer plastic at the very least, or why bother including it; just seemed a tad silly.  Other than that it was perfect.",

Mike and Veronica,It's white on the inside,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20OEJNT8NPYFN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C73BNL6K,"1.0 "," the United States "," July 1, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Redblack,Verified Purchase,"This dress was such a disappointment. They screen printed the color onto the fabric or something. The color is only one sided. The inside is white. This means you can see the white from the giant bell sleeves. The bodice/corset is attached. Wish it was detachable. The whole thing looks cheap and feels cheap and just don't. Save your time and money by skipping this. If by chance you still wish to try it... The size I ordered is what Amazon told me to order, but it's way too big. Double check your measurements and don't go off the Amazon recommended size.",6
