Poverty All-Natural Shopper,"Good Fit, But Hard To Get On & Off. Cheap Material. Mediocre Stitching. Frustrating Suspenders.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R1ZYFVY3OZ16/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQLQJ9Q8,"2.0 "," the United States "," July 1, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,,"For reference, I’m an eccentric Goth that typically wears a teen size S or XS, though with bottoms, I sometimes have to size up to a M to accommodate my chunkier hips/thighs/butt area. I’m 5’4, 110 pounds, and I have the Theatrical Romantic Kibbe body type. I ordered this suspender skirt in a size S. To be clear, this is a 2-layered skirt, and the bottom layer is not shorts, like is can appear to be in some of the product images.  Once I manage to get this on to fit at my waist, it fits well, cinching all the way in around my 26in waist for a proper look, and the skirt area is plenty roomy. The suspender straps are a good length to fit securely over my shoulders, and they are adjustable. The problem is getting this thing on in the first place, since its tiny waistband doesn’t have a ton of stretch, and there is no zipper or buttons to allow it to be opened up. I first tried pulling it up over my butt and hips (38in), and while I was eventually able to shimmy it on over the course of several minutes of working it slowly up and smashing my butt fat down in all kinds of directions, I decided I’d never do that again. When I first took it off, I brought it up over my head. It’s also a good struggle to get it over my shoulders, but I’m flexible and can contort fairly well, so that’s my go-to method for this skirt from now on. Either way, it’s not easy. At least it does look pretty cute.  Moving onto the quality, it’s not great, even for this price range. The material is thin and cheap-feeling, reminding me of Halloween costume material. It has almost no stretch, and it wrinkles easily. The back of the waistband does have some good elastic stretch, but it’s not enough to make this easy to get on and off, as detailed earlier. The stitching looks mediocre, and I found plenty of loose threads and thread clumps, some of them astonishingly long. I went ahead and trimmed those. The heart-shaped buckles, at least, are metal, but they both arrived with their pegs not even being latched into the hole of the loops to which they’re attached. Since the material is so thin and flimsy, the suspenders move and twist around much more than I’d like, and they don’t even stay put in the buckles well, so they’re pretty frustrating.  Overall, while this skirt does have a cute style, it’s very disappointing in so many other ways that I can’t really recommend it. It does execute the “look” in general, but if I had examined it in a physical store, there’s no way I would have bought it.",
