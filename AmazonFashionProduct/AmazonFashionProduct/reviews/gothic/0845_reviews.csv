The reason for 4 stars is that two of the necklaces where too small I could not wear them . I'm 5.7 and 170 not sure if I have an extra fat neck but probably should have fit .,

Shannyne Tamayo,My favorite necklace set!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZSZDDF1LR6E0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5H58CB1,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 27, 2024",Color: Black Retro Coin Medallion,,I was highly impressed by the quality and appearance upon receiving my necklace set! Each individual necklace is beautifully made and fits perfectly. The size isn't ro small or to big. The clasps work well and close completely! The set goes from smallest to largest and sit evenly on the skin. Definitely a favorite buy!,
River,3.5 out of 5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTKB7R86QT3ZM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5H58CB1,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 18, 2024",Color: Black Retro Coin Medallion,,"This is a trendy little goth-cute necklace. It would've gotten 4.5/5, but I had to drop it to 3.5/5 BECAUSE whyyyyy did the manufacturer make the last chain (the one with the ""old coin"") SO much longer than all the rest??  This supposed to be a semi-stackable chain necklace set, in that each chain is slightly longer than the preceding chain, which gives of a very nice look . . . in the picture.  Irl, the last chain was significantly longer (at least a good 3 inches) than all the other chains. The one that's supposed to be like the centerpiece per se, just dropped below the neckline of the dress that I was wearing and you couldn't even see it at all! I had to tie it and craft a makeshift modification to get the look like the model has in the picture.  The ""metal"" chains seem to be decent quality - they're a little on the heavier side, like it definitely doesn't feel like one of those flimsy, chintzy necklaces from like Ruꬴ 2I or Forꬴvꬴr 2I, etc. But I can't get past how much LONGER that last chain is. It wrecks the whole vibe.",2
Deco-glam Fan,Better than pictured,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UIZ3KTNT192C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5H58CB1,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 15, 2024",Color: Peach Heart Pendant,,Wore all of the stackable necklaces to work yesterday under a suit jacket.  I received so many compliments.  I loved the edgy look of them that are feminine and not too chunky yet a little edgy.  The material is well constructed but the necklaces feel light and comfortable.  All of them look good on their own and or with each other.  They are hugely flattering with nearly any outfit.,
Jennifer,Fix your photo!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2THN16IRGQO3F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5H58CB1,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 13, 2024",Color: Black Retro Coin Medallion,,Soooo...I originally wanted the heart pendant....but when I went to choose the item it showed the black medallion under the heart option...and the heart under the medallion option.  So naturally....I chose the one that showed the photo I wanted.  As a result I got the medallion vs the heart pendant.  The rest of the necklace set it amazing!  My docking of 1 star was due to the false photos.,2
