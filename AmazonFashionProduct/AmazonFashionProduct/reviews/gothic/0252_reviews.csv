Remember 'yall: this is a costume jewelry piece. Meaning it's plated silver over a copper core. The plating will rub off with continued wear. Tip: paint the inside and outside of the band with clear nail polish to extend the wear of the silver plating. As is, I don't expect this to last more than a couple wearings as the stone wobbles under the prongs. I'll super glue/hot glue the stone in the setting. When a tiny marcasite stone should unglue, remember you can buy a little bag of replacement stones online, and superglue them in. (They're super cheap) If you want an actual 100% 925 silver ring that looks like this, for daily wear or as an heirloom piece, look and buy elsewhere. It's good for what it is: Costume Jewelry. Which is exactly what I wanted.",
