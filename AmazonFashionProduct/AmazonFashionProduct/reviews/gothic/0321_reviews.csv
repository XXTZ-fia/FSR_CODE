Carolyn Rowitz-VanCamp,It fits,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RJMARDDVC9C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08FWV4BV1,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I got my hoodie today. I purposely bought it in XXL but it fits like a medium wood so if you’re not planning on having a tighter hoodie around the waist area, that would be my concern the sleeves fit like an XXL.

Ophelia,Weird text on the shirt...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KL6KX3VVN03Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08FWV4BV1,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 9, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"So, I would've given this 5 stars. Buttttt it feels like it runs a little small. The main issue however, is that it randomly says ""Little Hell Boy"" on the front? I'm all for saying screw gender norms but I'm a woman trying to buy clothes that were labeled as women's clothes. Why put a random edgy bit of text on the front especially if you're not going to mention that the text is on there in the advertisement? It's a very unusual choice. Though I do have some trans friends who may enjoy this. But yeah, definitely think it should be mentioned in the description that it says ""Little Hell Boy"" lmao. Sounds very edgy 😂",
