Pat- bo-bat,"broke easily, difficult to get on an off",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RO4MLNA694L9X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CF9KB7BR,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 2, 2025",Color: 1,Verified Purchase,"These look really cool and were really cool for about 24 hours.  The twisting, screw-esk mechanism is extremely difficult to use and I struggled with putting these in my ears comfortably. Not long after this, the plastic entirely snapped away from the metal earring bit.  I just gauged my ears not too long after this. 9/10 would recommend that instead of buying this.",

Katrina L. Alfonso,Cute but a pain in the azz,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HNDMMZ91WAWV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CF9KB7BR,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 17, 2024",Color: 1,Verified Purchase,"Love the style and idea but makes no sense the two sides don't just clip together and why someone thought screw in was a good idea. So hard to screw in because they're big. And the post wasnt on same side on each earring, making it even more annoying. Love the look but probably wouldn't order again instead look for an easier pair to put on",
