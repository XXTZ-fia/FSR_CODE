I am in love with my first Dare To Wear purchase. I love the style of their tops but am always weary to buy them because the sizes seem different and they are a lot more pricey then I would normally spend on a top. However, I received an Amazon gift card for Christmas and decided to give the Electra top I had been eyeballing for a long time a try. I used the Dare To Wear size chart provided. I am normally a 12/14 - 38C top which I normally do a Large but their chart said a 1X so that is what I ordered. I received it yesterday and tried it on and it fits me like a glove. I didn't have to adjust the tie in the back or anything. I was nervous the top portion may be too big since these run as plus sized tops but it wasn't at all. It's very flattering and comfortable at the same time. Some may think it's not worth the money cause the fabric is on the thinner side but that's also what makes it so soft and comfortable.I also love how the lace and grommets are perfect for an edgy yet feminine look. It's very ""me"" and I am very happy I took the risk to order it. I can't wait to wear it and now want one in every color.",3

I am very large chested (44DDD) and it fits just fine, although, if you don't want to show any cleavage, I would wear a lacy tank top, or camisole under it...I normally wear a 3x, and that's what I ordered, so I would say it fits true to size.

I don't have an unusual shape and usually wear an XL with no problem. I ordered the 1x and the sleeves are a bit too short. It has an awkward fit, where it is short in the sleeves, tight in the stomach and then a bit too big in the shoulders. The material is clingy and flouncy and gives a balloon effect which is simply not flattering for full figured women. It makes me look much bigger than I really am. Also, the corset strings tie in the back which really is unflattering for full figures. I bought 2 of these (the other in the charcoal) and will keep them if I ever lose some weight but for now, they make me look very hefty. Finally, they are in no way worth the 65 dollars I paid for each. There is nothing high quality about them though the pricetag suggests otherwise. Very disappointed :(",
