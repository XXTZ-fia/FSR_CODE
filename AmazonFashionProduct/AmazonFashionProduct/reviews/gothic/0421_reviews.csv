Rachel,"Skull Bohemian Boho Hobo Hippie Gothic Crossbody Bag Purse - 33"" Black: A Stylish Yet Fragile Purse",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DCYXF6WA7MCS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08NCLLCXS,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 8, 2024",Color: Fireblackwhite,Verified Purchase,"I recently purchased the Skull Bohemian Boho Hobo Hippie Gothic Crossbody Bag Purse in black, and overall, I'm quite pleased with its design and aesthetic, but there are a few things that could be improved.  First, let me say that I absolutely love the design of this purse. The skull and gothic details give it a bold, unique flair that's perfect for anyone who enjoys boho or alternative fashion. The color is a deep, classic black that goes with pretty much anything, and the intricate pattern adds a nice touch of personality. I also really like the shape of the bag—it’s roomy enough for all the essentials while still maintaining that relaxed, hobo-style look. It’s comfortable to wear as a crossbody, and the overall style really complements my personal vibe.  However, my main issue with the bag is the material. It feels quite thin and not as durable as I was hoping. While the purse is lightweight, I’m concerned about how it will hold up over time with regular use. It’s fine for carrying light items, but I wouldn't trust it for anything too heavy or if I need a bag that can withstand a lot of wear and tear. For the price, it’s a decent deal, but I do wish the fabric was thicker and more robust. A higher-quality material would have really made this bag a standout purchase.  In summary, this purse is a great option if you're looking for something stylish and affordable, but be mindful that the fabric might not stand up to heavy use. If durability isn’t a dealbreaker for you, it’s definitely a solid choice for adding a cool, boho vibe to your wardrobe!",

I don't ever use the button since it has a zip closure, but the button loop is the perfect thing to hang my keys on so I'm not digging for them.  The one negative thing I will say is that it sat in water for a couple of hours when there was an unwitness leak in my backseat which did cause some discoloration in the bottom of the fabric.
