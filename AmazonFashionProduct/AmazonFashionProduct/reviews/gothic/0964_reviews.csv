Gina S.,"Super cute earrings, chains are very dainty though.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KR16SBM2EF90/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C6GQ75D2,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 5, 2024",Color: Spike_Silver,,These are super cute earrings and get lots of complements whenever I wear them. The chains are very dainty though and have to be very careful with them. I have to be careful where I'm going and what i'm going as they tangle easy and catch on things. They don't travel well either (in your luggage / travel jewelry cases). I find I have to have my hair tied up or back so my hair is not getting tangled in them or it can be a thing. It's weird.... so they don't get as much wear I'd figure they would.  The don't bother my skin though... for those who need hypoallergenic metal. No goofy color changes with these... so truly a good stainless steel.,

HOWEVER, I think they're 1) a great price, 2) versatile in that you can select the colors you want in a pack, 3) stylish, and 4) convenient - what a great idea to have the back of the earring connected to the earring itself, so you don't lose anything!",

They can be worn all day long without pinching the ears.

Overall, I really like them and would not hesitate to purchase another pair if I ever lost these.",

I thought at first maybe it was the coating/metal. After giving them a really good alcohol rinse I have had no reaction.  Despite that I REALLY love the design of these! They're not just cool, but they're practical in that you can't lose the earing backing without losing the whole earing (which is way harder than just losing a backing).  The earing itself and the backing are a snug fit. They are metal with a thin black coating on them. When sliding the backing on it feels like its catching on the coating, maybe scrapping it up. So I don't have confidence they could last for very long, but at least until then, they look cool.",

It gives me punk rock vibes from growing up. I really like them; they are cute and very stylish as well. Very comfortable to wear, not heavy at all. They go with any outfit and look good either with your daily wear or evening wear. I like the look of chain threader earrings but sometimes I don't actually like the feeling of the chain going through my pierced hole as it tends to be too big, these look like that but have the typical earring post that doesn't feel like the chain ones do. I like them a lot!!",

I feel like they give me an edgy look. The backs can be a little difficult to put on, so that takes some practice. At least you’ll never lose them since it’s attached to the earring. It’s also light weight which I appreciate, you can wear in comfort for hours.",

They come in a cute jewelry box, with each earring individually packaged in a small plastic bag to prevent them from tangling up. Very gift-able for sure. My ears tend to be sensitive to some materials, but these I can wear without issue and can wear them outside of the event I got them for. I'd expected them to be a bit bigger (they're about half the size I expected), however they're very cute on.",2

The style is really fun and the chain is just what I was looking for.  The gold shade is very real looking and the metal has not caused any irritation in my ears which are pretty sensitive to different metals.  Great value!,
