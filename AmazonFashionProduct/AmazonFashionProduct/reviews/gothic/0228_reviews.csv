I am an 18/20 US and got an X-Large. The fit was just as shown in the image. Honestly, it is perfect for me. One thing I don't like is when sweaters have fleece lining because, although it is soft, it is too hot for where I live. This sweater doesn't have an added lining so it will breathe nicely in the mild climate of my home state.  I will say, I am fairly short (~5'4) and have have a pretty short torso. The shirt hit me right at the hip. If I were any longer, I am not sure I would like the fit as much because I was looking for something that was slouchy casual.",3
