sexmxtxlbxrbie,Weird Sizing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7NDAK5OFB8WG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BYFBT95J,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Black 7,Verified Purchase,"As other reviews state, the sizing is super weird. For me, im 5'8 126 lbs, A cup bra, and despite it being short and tight around to bust and butt the belly/torso area is loose and leaves a weird sag of fabric thats a bit unappealing. the extra fabric makes it less see through which is sad :( otherwise; i quite like it. I work out and lift alot and the dress is flattering on my muscles and curves ^_^ wouldnt recommend for anyone with boobs or super thick thighs i think it would roll up",

I'm normally a small/size 4.  I first ordered a medium and I could get into it (needed help to get out of it).  It was wearable and very sexy but I felt I had to keep pulling it down to avoid flashing people and it was hard to get off without ripping.  Size large feels more like a normal fit and is comfortable. Definitely larger in the bust with no adjustment method available as noted by others but unless you are very small up top you should be fine.  In short:  if you are very small-chested or going for a sluttly look, size up by one.  If you want a normal fit size up by 2.",2

I'm able to sit comfortably on my sofa but i think my shorts are preventing the dress from rolling or sliding up. I am currently wearing spandex shorts and a black soft bra under but still comfortable I think it looks really good in person not to photogenic, though That could also just be due to the lack of effort I put into taking the photos. 😂",4
