HAH Austin,EXTREMELY Disappointed 😢,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R3IW4VBJBN7R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NZ49LK8,"1.0 "," the United States "," April 26, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"The screw at the end of the metal bar is crooked and the bolt sent with the scales to affix it on the bottom is wrong, goes far past the bottom so the whole thing wobbles on the tip of the screw only made worse by the fact the screw itself is crooked in the main rod. I tossed the box in too much excitement and it’s very cumbersome to return. Unfortunately I don’t have a flat nut around that will fit the screw to make the bottom sits level so at some point im going to have to go to Lowe’s to see if i can talk them into selling me just one that’ll fit (but it’s likely I’ll have to buy a whole box of screws and nuts just to get the right one for this thing).  The metal is too inflexible to bend the screw back into shape or to knock back the handles on the nut (WHY?!?!?) without destroying it. So it’s currently serving no purpose other than mimicking rocking around like my dresser has been transported onto a boat lol. If I had the right nut for the bottom screw I might be able to force it into correct upright position but as is the nut they sent doesn’t even keep screwing on all the way and gets stuck after a couple turns. Even if it did screw further there’s no way it could screw up high enough to no longer be jetting past the bottom making it wobble on a crux.  I didn’t want scales that moved so if it wasn’t for this senseless ill fitting bolt and crooked weld job between the shaft and bottom screw to affix it to the jewelry tray I’d be over the moon for what I paid. Alas… it’s completely functionless until I do significant modifications to fix the garbage craftsmanship and both that or returning it are going to consume time that’s more valuable than what I got robbed buying this thing.  Will not buy from this seller again. 0/0 recommend. Pay a few extra bucks for something manufactured with the tiniest bit of quality control. This feels like they literally pulled random parts and threw them in the box. Extremely disappointed, was really excited about using this to display some new jewelry I invested in and I had to resort to buying an alternative since i didn’t previously keep jewelry on display and hate jewelry boxes. Plus a reviewer said they got a half refund for one that doesn’t work? HALF?! I’ve had sellers send me whole replacements no further questions without even asking for it back when it just didn’t work, half of my money for something that doesn’t look or work as advertised at all is insulting. Not worth the effort, I’ll just fix it if I find the time or throw it out which is wasteful and loathsome considering all I need is a proper nut for the screw to maybe force it to stand straight. Would have cost them like 2 cents to send a proper fitting part, I am absolutely floored how many positive reviews there are considering I can’t see how this assembly would ever be sturdy unless they just happened to send me the ONLY one with a nut that has arms (extremely uneven ones at that) for some reason. Oh well. Last time I toss a box before assembly.",3
