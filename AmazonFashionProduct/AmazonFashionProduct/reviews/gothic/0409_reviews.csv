I bought it to wear under a corset top and it was perfect for that. Because the bottom half of the shirt is more plain and fitted, it worked REALLY well tucked in to a skirt.

It is definitely sheer--you could see a bra underneath it, so I'll be wearing a nude camisole. I have a small bust but it is still flattering, giving the illusion of slightly more up top before narrowing at the waist. I think it probably looks better on those with larger busts, though. I plan to pair it with a high-waisted skirt and the combination looks great.  Pros: -Stretchy -flattering -Armpit area isn't tight (probably good--my guess is the color will stain from sweat, so sitting further away from the armpit is nice)  Cons: -VERY big seams. I am autistic, so these may bother me more than others, but I have to wear a bra+a camisole underneath to avoid the seams rubbing against me. It is irritating, though I doubt it would lead to physically irritated skin unless you have extremely sensitive/delicate skin. If you're the type of person who hates tags in your clothing, though, it may bug you. -Sheer -Two different styles of fabric? Bust feels more like polyester/rayon, a little rougher, while the waist is much smoother, thick, and stretchy--think sports leggings material.",21
