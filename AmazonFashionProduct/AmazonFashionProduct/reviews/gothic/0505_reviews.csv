My lady finds it very comfortable to wear and wears it without anything underneath. This dress is made for thicker ladies, but it's a bit fitted so it help accentuate those natural curves. Well made dress, no complaints.",

Christina Brodeur,I received so many compliments in this dress.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DRT3YRHEKPV5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D263Z3SV,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 8, 2024",,,"I wore this dress to my nieces bridal shower recently ( she has my sense of humor, and she loved it,) and I received many compliments. I was surprised that even the older women, aged 70+ enjoyed looking at it.  The fabric is nice and lightweight, and did not make my skin itch. I added a wide black belt because it did run a little large, and the seam where the skirt attaches to the top sat weird on me. I would have gave the dress 5 stars if it wasn’t for that seam.",4
Chollsy2.0,Perfect!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OTFOETIGBP7F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D263Z3SV,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 27, 2024",,,"This dress is awesome! It fits just right. It's tight on the top and very flowy in the skirt. It also comes down to my knees, so I don't have to worry about it being too short. It is very well made and looks amazing on. It is everything I hoped it would be and more.  I am very happy with this and would recommend it to others.",

Eden Charles,Great dress with some room to grow,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HPN9VELI5CJA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D263Z3SV,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 24, 2024",Size: Medium PlusColor: Black_02,,"I got this for my oldest (11) in the Medium plus size and it's a bit loose around the bust, but you know how girls are in puberty, she'll have grown into it by the end of summer I'm sure. The print quality on the fabric is very nice and it drapes nicely. The sizing chart was a little confusing to interpret, which may also be part of why it doesn't fit quite right right now, but I was mostly just happy to have found a dress that she was willing and looking forward to adding to her wardrobe. Like most t-shirt-y fabrics it's very forgiving and flattering for a variety of body shapes.",
Becky at the beach,"Bright, vibrant, fun!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NB390XRLAQLV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D263Z3SV,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 24, 2024",Size: Large PlusColor: Multi_01,,"Yes, yes, the dress fits true to size, the construction is good with finished seams and well sewn. But come one, this dress is just so cool. While the photo looks good, in person it's just so bright and vibrant. I want to wear it everywhere and twirl while doing so! It's very flattering in fit, especially for my pear shape. Because it has no darts it's great for a flatter chest, but the fit at the bottom is good for a larger bottom and thighs. Did I mention how amazing it looks? It washed well, no fading, no shrinking, which is good as I imagine it will be washed a lot since I want to wear it to all the things!",
YogiTranscend,"BIG US Sizing, SIZE DOWN 2 sizes!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP9OHGDUGEQIM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D263Z3SV,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 24, 2024",Size: 1XColor: Black_03,,"This dress is MASSIVE! I Love it still though! For reference: 5' 4"", 38 G/DDD Cups, Hourglass figure, 220lb. I typically wear around an 18 US sizing. I decided to size down to 1xl which was supposedly equivalent to size 14-16/ 205 lb wearer BUT it is still Very Big on me!!! Like I suggest sizing doen 2 sizes! I think a Large woyld have fit me nice wurh comfy room to spare. Im going to just wear a cute cincher across the umpire waist area to get some form fitting to thos since it is 2 sizes too big. If by some chance you accidentally order a size that is way too small, even if it is tight, it has so much stress that it won't matter. Almost wish they would have sent a way smaller size so I could get nice form fit to it. As is, it is very comfortable and flowy. It does hit to my knees. The sleeves go down just above my elbows. It is extremely stretching and the print is amazing on the stress. I will say the price is awesome at $38 as well. Reminds me of the Hot Topic prices when they have sales. I really like this brand, but I got used to the Chinese sizing. This is definitely an actual plus size and definitely a US Plus size. Keep that in mind, size down two sizes, and you'll be great. There was tons of room in my chest area too.",2
