Not impossible, just gotta finesse it a bit — Hence the bolo tie recommendation. You can find the one I have here on Amazon too. The wrists are nice detail as they have lace features and elastic that snug your wrist comfortably. The fabric itself isn’t a stretchy material but if you tuck it in and wear a vest, it’ll look great. Highly recommend!",4

Form fitting but not too tight. However, material is sheer enough for nipples/areolar to show through. Should be fine if wearing a vest or coat? Color is more ""off-white"" or ""light cream"" rather than ""White"". Sleeves are long enough and overall construction seems to be well done. I think this would be a find shirt for cosplay, pirate, etc. See pic - note color difference with actual ""White"" gloves and how dark counter shows through fabric. - I would not get this again for myself but with all the above I WOULD recommend to others. (Price was easy on the pocketbook too)",2

Simple as that, honestly. I originally bought it for a cosplay about a year or so ago, since then it's become practically a staple in my closet. It isn't see-through unless you get it wet, and even then it's not the worst. I've never had it tear, and stains come out of it all right! The ruffles look super nice as well. The sleeves are slightly itchy though at the ends, which was super unbearable at first, but it was again because I was in a like, 3 or 4 layered cosplay in Texas heat. After that first time, it was nearly unnoticeable. The lace does end up tearing as well, but I don't think this shirt is supposed to be worn as often as I do, so that might be me?
