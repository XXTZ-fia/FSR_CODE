We couldn't find the stone to adhere it back on, but we do have the sterling silver band. I decided to purchase her this ring again for her birthday because she loves it so much and was so sad that she lost the stone somewhere. The only reason I give this four stars and not five is because of the ring coming apart last time and the stone getting loose and falling out. I'm hoping that this ring will stay together and there won't be any issues this time around, considering my ring is still doing great, though I don't wear it every day like she wears hers.",

I have tried different fingers, but found that the rotating is a struggle to wear and find it fatiguing.  But for under $20 a ring for my large fingers. It is beautiful (I have received compliments).

I loved the ring so much I continued to wear it even though it had a cut mark, I still wore it proudly until it became too uncomfortable. I finally decided to buy a new one. I bought this ring as a gift for myself during a really challenging time in my life about 8 years ago. I wore it every single day and never did it tarnish or turn my skin green. I never took it off unless I was taking a shower. I wore it while cleaning, yard work, wearing lotion, hand washing, and even sleeping. All of the things they suggest you DON'T do, I did and this ring still maintained its original beauty. I am not kidding. This ring is one of the only rings I have ever owned that has not faded and looked dull and tired the older it gets. I have several hundred dollar rings that havn't come close to the quality as this ring. That's saying something. I absolutely recommend this ring. Don't even think about it, just do it. I promise you will love it just as much as I do. It's also very true to size and looks amazing.",12
