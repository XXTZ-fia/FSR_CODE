The pants here are ICNREDIBLY small. Could only get one leg in the waist small. Like these are a large... in kids sizes I guess. They might fit vertically but no way are they going to fit my waist.  The top fits perfectly, like slightly big as I was expecting this whole outfit to be. But also this top is a t-shirt with sleeve attachments which I wasn't expecting. Took me a WHILE to find where the buttons go, in the armpit of the shirt but near the hem by the way. Also the top is made from this swimsuity wish.com material. It's like kinda itchy but bearable. There are a few little loops sporadically placed for where the chains go. I kept the chains as they look pretty cool.  Overall, disappointed.",10
