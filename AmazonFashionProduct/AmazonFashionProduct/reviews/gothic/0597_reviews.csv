TygerCub,Absolutely love these pants!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WNHBFG783BTM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1Q689NW,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 12, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"These pants have become my go-to for summer Renfairs and are a favorite for lounging around the house!  I love the fact the legs don't have elastic!  The simple band of fabric feels much better than the crinkled gathered mess many other styles offer.  The buttons are plain, which works well for a ""historic"" style.  The seams are well done - no missed fabric or loose threads - and the elastic waist band is comfortable - especially after a good meal 😅.  The style pairs well with different time periods - from viking to renaissance, though they may be a bit too baggy for colonial.  Time jump forward a bit and they're perfect for my frumpy older persona.Definitely pick up a pair.I wasn't sure what to expect when purchasing these, since the sizing chart provided was confusing.  My true waist size is about 44"" so I purchased a 3XL.  I could totally have fit in just a regular XL.  No big deal, I simply hemmed the sides at the pocket seams and now have a perfectly comfortable pair of pants.  I'll order XL next time - just have to decide which color.",

They are thin enough to be great in summer when he is not in the mood to wear shorts  FIT He wears size 34 pants and these in XL fit him well. We got the XL in case of shrinkage and glad we did. If they shrink at all, he will still be able to wear them.  COMFORT He really likes these pants to wear after work when grilling in the yard, or lounging around. I am not sure if he will wear them in public or not.  THE BOTTOM LINE These run a little smaller, but will shrink if you accidentaly put in the dryer, so best to size up a bit.  MY RATING FIVE STARS. These are great- so glad they are cotton. My husband really likes them.",

I love this brand. I'm a short handicapped female, comfort is a must for my clothes! I get amny things for renfaire/cosplay but I'll also wear them for everyday. I have fun doing my own style. These are great material, soft/loose & comfortable, easy to wear, cool/breathable.... I got this pair in black. Only thing I wish they would do the larger open top patch pockets in more of their pants. I prefer than over the slash pockets.  Have fun with this brands pieces, make it your own style. Take the fam to a renfaire for some wholesome family fun! And don't sweat the details! LOL!  The regular price $24.99 per the listing is ok. You can get many of their nicely made pieces in the $20 - $25.00 price range.  As always I only do honest reviews and update if needed. I hope this helps you make the best choices how to spend your $.",

David J.,Ok but not the most authentic in design,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KAK2DY6OCJ85/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1Q689NW,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 22, 2024",Color: Army GreenSize: Large,,"I suppose it's my fault for not carefully examining the photos before ordering. The waist band and the leg bands are not authentic. They did not have elastic waist and leg bands in the Renaissance or Colonial periods. The waist would have either had ties to tie it closed or it would have just been loose and requiring a belt. The leg bands would have had a button or garter to close them.  If you don't care about authenticity then these things won't matter to you. As for me, I will need to deconstruct the waist and leg bands and take out the elastics and for pirate leggings I will add a button at the bottom and at the waist. I will also be replacing the buttons with wood buttons which would have been more authentic as well but already knew I was replacing the buttons when I ordered this.  I am only taking off one star for the above faults due to the low price.  I can only marginally recommend this with the above caveats.",
