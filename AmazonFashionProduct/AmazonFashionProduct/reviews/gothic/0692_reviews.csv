Tina,Strong Perfume Smell,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2H2JY0EUOX8MS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLLJY6BC,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 24, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,The sweater itself is awesome.  The material seems like a double knit material.  Thick and soft.  My only con is that the sweater had a crazy strong unpleasant perfume smell.  Not sure if it is manufactured that way or if I got someone's return who had doused themselves with some weird smell.,

The spider graphic sweater looks so cool, my son loves it. The quality is amazing, and so is the graphic design. It is a little thicker than I expected, but very soft and comfortable. My son doesn't like the mock or turtle neck, this sweater meets his expectations, he loves how it fits around the neck.  It looks great to match with jeans and jogger pants.",

It looks pretty big, even for a large, but it might be because its heavy wool and bulky. The material is very soft, not scratchy at all. It's going to be nice and warm for the upcoming cold winter months",2
