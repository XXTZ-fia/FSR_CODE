Chollsy2.0,WAY too big,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26JIPZM7PYDT2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3LW6RN,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 12, 2024",Color: Black_1Size: 2X,,"This is the 3rd dress I have ordered by Rosegal and it is the third and final time I have been disappointed. I ordered this dress in my size based on my measurements and this dress is still too big. When I order down a size, it's too small. I do not have this problem with most other clothing items, so I am not quite sure what the problem is.  The material is soft and comfortable. This dress is very well made. But none of that matters if I can't wear it or I have to pay extra just to get it tailored to actually fit.  I really like the style of clothing this brand has to offer, but after this, I won't be ordering from this brand anymore.",
Shawna M,cheap quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R259CG1MF3IZFK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3LW6RN,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 19, 2024",Color: Black_1Size: 2X,Verified Purchase,"it's cute, but the quality is cheap. The entire backside is just plain black and looks nothing like the front. It has similar quality to a halloween costume",
tabitha,Decent quality with a few flaws,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AKOTE1DYGHHX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3LW6RN,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 18, 2024",Color: Black_1Size: Large Plus,,So I found this dress to be of decent quality. It's definitely all synthetic material but it is very soft and stretchy. The red is a rich dark red and looks amazing under the mesh over layer. The corset lacing allows for a bit of customization in tightness.  Dislikes: Order for my girlfriend. I matched her measurements to the size chart and she found it to fit a tad bit loose. We could have gone down a size. The sewn on cross is not centered. The straps are a very big different from the dress. I feel thw straps just looked weird and didn't fit the style of the dress.,
Crystal Lewis,Beautiful dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R207WOAJEC4OOL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3LW6RN,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 22, 2024",Color: Black_1Size: Large Plus,Verified Purchase,"This dress, size large plus, was bought for my daughter who loves goth fashion.  The only issue that we had with the dress was the cross sewed onto the front being off center.  She loved it so much that she didn't want to return it and wait for a replacement so we just cut the cross off.  It still looks beautiful even without the cross and it is comfortable, flowy, and very flattering.  I highly recommend this dress.",
