The material is flexible, yet thick enough to hide fabric folds underneath. The design is beautiful too. It fits exactly how it said it would. I ordered a 22""-26"" because I wanted something more snug on my 26.5"" waist, and it worked out great. One thing I would mention is the ""white"" option is slightly off-white, but not to an obvious degree.",

I should mention that it doesn’t breathe so by the end of the night the inside of the leather part was a little damp because of sweat. I really think it’s a great value for the money. Sorry my photo isn’t the best quality, but you can see how it looked in my pirate inspired outfit. Oh and where I wore it which was around my lower ribs (kinda around the diaphragm where your ribs part and stuff (idk)) has a circumference of 29 inches at the largest point. I was able to breathe comfortably even with it there.",
