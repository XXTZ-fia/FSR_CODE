Amazon Customer,"Super cute, but has an uncomfortable seam",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20HZDCFU3ETQR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3SLHQ3,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"It looks great and I love the thumb holes but unfortunately it has a seam just under the boob area that can shifts upward when you move, so you can't wear it without a bra and expect it to be comfy. I had kinda wanted it for around the house, but at least it's nice for going out.",

It's a heavier knit that will be perfect in fall and winter. One of my favorite features are the thumb holes in the sleeves!

Chris,"Not as cute as the images show, but not bad",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JKWQGSH3W47M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3SLHQ3,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 7, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large Plus,,"I got this for my high school aged daughter, and when I got it I was disappointed because it's not quite as cute as it seems in the images.  The fabric is thick and stretchy, like a sweatshirt would be.My daughter loves it, and will definitely wear it to school, I just think they could have made the transition seams that go from one color to another a little better, so it'd look like the second color was a separate shirt worn under the first color.  It's not like that at all, just straight across seams that look cheap and quick.",
