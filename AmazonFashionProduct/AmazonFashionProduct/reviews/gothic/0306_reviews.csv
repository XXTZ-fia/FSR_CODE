Leah,If you're a small in America buy a small.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32XEY1YQSYMWJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCW2W8LY,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 30, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I bought a small because I saw a review of somebody that was my height and weight almost and it looked perfect on her so I went with the small against what the sizing said to do and I am extremely happy I did. So hopefully this will help someone else decide. This freaking dress is absolutely gorgeous and so comfortable I could sleep in it. I am 5 ft 2. I have a size 32 D bra, or usually have to get a 34 and tighten it to the tightest size. I weigh 123 lb. A small fit me perfectly. Use American sizes at least if you're a small and my size and weight. I can confirm it will fit. Hope this helps. This is not some piece of crap $10 dress. This is good comfortable material. And it came already perfectly set up for me I didn't even have to adjust the straps. Probably going to see what other dresses I can buy from this company. Get the effing dress. Do it.",

Fits well. The straps are finicky and don't always stay in the hole you set it to but not too annoying. Decent fabric. It's actually thick which is unusual for Amazon clothes. I'd buy it again,

Fits wonderfully even on the bigger  taller girls!  as a broad shouldered taller woman with some wider hips this made me feel so good!!  Follow the chart and you will have a dress worth wearing and always feeling good in!!,

So I got it and was very excited to try it on because it’s really cute! Tried it on, and it fit… Barely. And the fit was such that it would have been mildly inappropriate for anywhere other than clubbing or at a beach. Checked the tag and it said size 12!? I usually wear a size 16-20 depending on the style, so now I understand why it fit so snug lol. The craftsmanship was good, so I was pretty sad it didn’t fit.",

Vitus,Gothic vibes.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EU1WGGLOHU40/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCW2W8LY,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 15, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Deep Red,,"This dress looks exactly how it’s pictured in the example picture. It’s super cute and also gives me early 2000 Gothic vibes. I do love the way this dress fits, especially around the chest area and how it is very flowy and fairy-like on the bottom half. The straps are adjustable, but if you need to adjust the straps to the last hole, you’ll have a lot of excess strap that hangs over the chest. It’s nothing that takes away from the style of a dress, but it is some thing I would have preferred to be able to tuck away.  I got this dress in a small and I will say that it is true to size. I also chose the red color for this dress, and I love that it was a deep red rather than a bright red. The material is stretchy, and It feel very cotton like, so my only concern is it might stretch out from the straps with multiple uses in the future. Overall, the dress is really cute and really brings me back to my early 2000s punk rock days without being over the top Gothic. If you’re contemplating the dress, I definitely say take the plunge and go for it.",

There is so much fabric that the dress is much heavier than it needs to be, once on it almost weighs you down. I like the idea of this but it was executed poorly. The shoulder straps need to be pulled to the last hole which makes the bust area fit funny and then there is a lot of excess strap just hanging in the front.",

It's basically tshirt material with embellishments. I went off the size chart and doing that, this runs large. If I would have purchased my normal size I think I would have been fine, but as is, I was able to get this on and still have it be big without unzipping the side at all. I really do love that you can adjust the strap length because as a tall woman usually the straps are too short. This I can adjust till it feels right and helps cover the too-large chest area. It's very cute and flattering too!",
Poverty All-Natural Shopper,Prepare To Twirl. Flattering. Flowing. Adjustable Shoulder Straps.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQBEWZZEIKY8P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCW2W8LY,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 25, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Deep Red,,"For reference, I’m an eccentric Goth that typically wears a teen size S or XS and a 32B bra, I’m 5’4, 115 pounds, and I have the Theatrical Romantic Kibbe body type. I ordered this dress in a size S in the color “Deep Red_1.” In person, the red color is a perfectly standard red that doesn’t have any brown in it to make it more of a burgundy like what my device screen shows in the product images. Still, it looks very nice and totally classic.  This dress looks super flattering on me despite not fitting super tightly, even though I usually prefer a tight fit. It’s neither loose at all, thankfully. I’m even able to wear it without a bra, as it manages to provide my smallish boobs with some sexy lift. It accentuates my curvy figure beautifully for a very feminine look. Length-wise, it reaches all the way down to my ankles. It flows so beautifully and is the kind of dress that produces an excellent twirl. The straps are totally adjustable using the buckles, but the buckles don’t feel all that sturdy. Nor do the straps, for that matter, but I’m not concerned by that. On the side is a hidden-type zipper that works quite well.  The material feels very t-shirt-like to me, and all the overlapping skirt layers give it a good amount of weight. The material, still, is fairly thin, so since the torso is only one layer thick and the bust two layers thick, those upper areas could be see-thru in bright lighting, especially in a light color. Finally, the stitching isn’t bad or anything, but it could use some improvement, as I did notice several minor flaws.  Overall, I think this is a very flattering dress that complements my style nicely.",

We went with the red dress with the black highlights since we thought that black trimming made the red pop and it does. To her surprise the dress has a weight to it we were expecting when I saw it. The dress offers a zipper on the right side under the armpit to help you put it on, and the zipper got stuck in a few places on ours. The stitching and the layering of the cloth are very nice as is the strap system. Overall she loves the look at feel of the dress, 4-stars.",

I usually wear an XL in dresses, but there was only a choice for 1X in this, so that’s what I ordered. The size chart shows XL but no 1X so i assumed it was the same thing. It fits perfectly. I’m 5’5”, 180lbs, 42/36/42 for reference. It’s very low cut and looks great. It’s similar to a tshirt material, so soft, lightweight, and a bit stretchy. The layers of skirt hang nicely and are flattering. Everything seems sewn well and it looks just like the listing photos. Washes and dries well. Very cute dress, I’m quite pleased with it.",

My measurements are bust is 35 inches waist is 25 inches hips are 35 inches and normally I take a size small but they were out of stock so I figured I would see how a medium fit and I was pleasantly surprised if it’s great, because this set a little bit higher than my normal waist the bigger waist line is actually an empire waist calling around my ribs so it fits perfect. It’s not too big at all it’s longer than I would like it to be in materials kind of like a T-shirt material  Kind of cheap. I wish it was little bit better material but it’s fine and more importantly, its fits!! so you might want to size up as well because this will not fit at your natural waist. At least it doesn’t mean my last picture I am three-point were my natural waisted you can see this is about 2 inches above it. I hope this helps you get the right size. Good luck :-)",

It is a bit large around the bust for me. I am a 34B, and there’s a bit of a gap, even if I am wearing a bra. The fabric is beautifully soft, flows very well, and the dress is comfortable to wear even in the heat of the Summer months, which is what we are having right now here in Los Angeles. That’s why I chose the white color. The only problem I had with this dress is that the zipper was misaligned, and could not zip down past a certain point. I had to remove the zipper and install a new one. The dress works fine now. As a Vine Reviewer, I did not have the option of returning the dress or exchanging it for another one, but I’m sure that if you buy this dress, you will probably not have the problem that I had with the zipper, but if you do, you can simply return it and exchange it for a dress that has a well-aligned zipper. Aside from the zipper problem that I encountered, I find this to be a wonderful quality dress, and quite reasonably priced.",
