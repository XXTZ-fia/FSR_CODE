The fabric is more of a crepe feel and fairly sheer so a camisole would be in order if not wearing a vest or jacket.  I normally wear a large, and the extra-large is tight, including the sleeves.  The neck is also tight, but not too uncomfortable.  My reason for 4 stars vs 5 is all about the sizing.  The ruffles are great and perfect for the Victorian look I needed to accomplish.  The front ruffle is perfect above a waistcoat/vest, and the sleeve ruffles are perfectly long enough to extend past jacket sleeves for the desired look.  Overall, this is a great shirt and well worth the money if you can find the right size.",9

I received lots of compliments on it. Fits perfectly. 😊  However, the reason for 4 stars is because, when I received the shirt there was evidence that it had been a previously worn and then returned. There were foundation stains on the collar and inner button hole seam of the shirt.  I did not realize it had stains until the night before the event I needed to wear the shirt (when I went to steam it). Fortunately, I had some Miss Mouth's Messy Eater spray and it brought the stains right out! I was very pleased it worked out.  Other minor defect I noticed was the inseam on the back of the shirt is uneven (bunched). I can live with that though and will be keeping the shirt.  Overall, it's a great shirt for the price. Just be sure to thoroughly check the shirt when you receive it!
