LP,This is a great quality piece.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O8LA1VDQWBXP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01NCE2T2Q,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 2, 2024",Color: Style 1,Verified Purchase,"This is beautifully made. Solid piece. Looks just as pictured. It is a little heavy for staying put in my hair, just wants to slide down. But, I’m still keeping it and feel it is worth it.",
Amanda,Very nice quality.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Z88BWLNHSKTK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01NCE2T2Q,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 31, 2024",Color: Style 1,Verified Purchase,"This hair clip is very cute. I got this to wear for our company's fundraising event in October in which I am going as a steampunk. It's very nice quality, made of a full metal and not plastic, and especially for the price. It has an alligator clip that may hold my hair, but I plan on using bobby and upins to give it more support. The chains do get tangled easily but it kind of won't matter if it's in my hair, should add to the beauty of it overall.",

Tessa,Stunning,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DUGFORD5K21G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01NCE2T2Q,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 29, 2019",Color: Style 1,Verified Purchase,"Stunning piece, love it. Though as others have mentioned the piece is rather heavy so it slides right out of my hair. Though as another also commented, securing it to the pony tail will work just fine.  I am giving it 4/5 stars only because if the heavy weight. I can not wear it as a side clip as I had planned, and can only wear it with the pony tail so that it stays in place.",2
Mom of 4,Super cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R115QGWR459PA2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01NCE2T2Q,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 25, 2019",Color: Style 1,Verified Purchase,"Loved this, super cute and worked great with my outfit. Only bummer is that it was super heavy and it wouldn't hold my hair. Solution was putting in a small ponytail in, then sliding the clip in the middle of it and latching onto the ponytail. Then it stayed in place!",2
