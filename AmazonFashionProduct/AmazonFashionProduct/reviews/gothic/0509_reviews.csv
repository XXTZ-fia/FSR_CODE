ADubs,Very shiny,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1B9BBUPKTOKMW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRJPQHJC,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 16, 2024",,,"This is a decent necklace if you’re looking for something chunky and flashy. I originally got it because I wanted a nice layered necklace and I don’t mind a heavier look, but when I put it on it’s the exact type of thing I wore as a 16yr old. Not a bad thing, just not my current style :D It’s a little shorter than I expected, as well.",

It is super cute and fits well. It is versatile and can be worn with just about anything. It looks great and I am very happy with it. I would recommend it to others. It would also make a wonderful gift as well.",
