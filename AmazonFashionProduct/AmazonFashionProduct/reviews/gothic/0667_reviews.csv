Shante,Great fit and quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6QXDB37R29S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C9YZ9QGL,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Size: XX-Large-3X-LargeColor: Beige,Verified Purchase,I purchased this for a last minute Halloween costume and figured it might be a throwaway item that I wore once. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and fit. It's a very well made garment and it looked great on. If anything I might say it possibly ran a little large. Depending on the look you're going for. I'm definitely keeping it in realize it's versatile and I can wear it for a couple of different things. I can easily convert it from a Renaissance faire garment to a goth look by pinning and adjusting the length of the skirt. I usually wear a 16w and I think I bought a 2X if I'm not mistaken. The 2X great but I think I probably could have gotten a 1X and been happy.,

J Cheshier,"Pretty Dress, too long",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38SGSP2B87W0M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C9YZ9QGL,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 12, 2024",Size: XX-Large-3X-LargeColor: Beige,Verified Purchase,"Out of the package, I thought this dress looked killer. It was very wrinkly, but I was trying to put together a Saloon girl costume. Everything about it was perfect, except the length. I am a 6 foot tall woman, and this easily touched the floor. Because of this, I had to return, as I needed to be mobile for my event. I ended up renting a costume, but this dress looked better. I just wish it was a normal length. Other than that, it fit well, was a true 2X. Maybe you could get away with it by wearing heels?",

However, it is completely made for persons who are 6 feet tall and live their lives in high heels. I'm 5'3"", this actually pools by a few inches at my feet. However, this is not a problem as (like the little skirt hikes present in my photo) I will be installing hook and eye catches at hem and waist so that I can hike the skirt in front, which gathers enough that I don't trip on stairs. I want like five more. Very comfortable, though keep in mind the type of fabric is a little thin and makes some noise when moving. I had not ironed or tossed into the dryer when putting it on, so its also very wrinkly.",

Normally when I order anything that comes from the east, it runs so tiny so I ordered the 3x which I normally do. And this thing is just massive. It did not look good because it was way too big. That being said, it is a very nice dress, the Deep green is a beautiful color, and the dress is very well constructed. I have some other dresses to try for my costume but if they don't work out I may come back and order this dress but only in a smaller size.",

High-quality material, generously cut (long enough for me and I’m 6’1”). Could have gone a size smaller overall, but I didn’t want to take a chance on length. Incredible dress for the price.",

Kez McIntyre,Beautiful comfortable dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYJ8G1DFGP36Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C9YZ9QGL,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 15, 2024",Size: Small-MediumColor: Pumpkin,Verified Purchase,"Bought for a ren faire and it was so comfortable.

Michelle Roth,"Comfortable, light, true to size",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EVN1KW8E3SJR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C9YZ9QGL,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 20, 2024",Size: XX-Large-3X-LargeColor: Deep Green,Verified Purchase,"Wore this to the ren Faire. It was very comfortable and light, great for summer heat and humidity. It fit true to size and just brushed the ground on me, I’m 5’6” - had to hitch it up going up the hills so I might have to hem it a bit before next time. I got a lot of complements. The color is more of a peacock blue than a deep green, still pretty. The quality is great, good stitching, opaque material - it is a slippery type material which I didn’t expect but it was fine. Threw it in the dryer for a few minutes to get the wrinkles out from shipping. The waste is very elastic and forgiving, lots of material for flowy-ness. Can be worn above shoulders to cover a bra. I’d love to see this dress with the drape a complementary color to break it up a bit.",
Megan Steinhoff,This rocks!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ3H1H69O9CDY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C9YZ9QGL,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 6, 2024",Size: XX-Large-3X-LargeColor: Beige,Verified Purchase,This is large but comfy and definitely gives off renaissance vibes. I would say fit wise this dress runs bigger. I got the off white/ivory in a 2XL/3xl (and I weight about 305lbs 5’3”). I usually wear a 3xl because I like to be flowy but a 1xl is usually just right but tight fit for me. I think with this dress I could have sized down and been ok (for me I have large hips/stomach and like B bust). This dress is about half a foot too long on me. Overall I think this is awesome and I would buy again. Looks wonderful just had to pin it up a little.,4

I would definitely recommend!",5
