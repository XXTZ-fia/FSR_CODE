Caitlin D.,Loved it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LTSD27ZEGJWM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8TBXWR3,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Could have gone down a size, bust area does have some “baggy” cloth in middle, but that’s because I’m plus sized, but my chest is not proportional to that of my body. Not all fat women have massive boobies to fill the tops all the way! :’( Overall great quality, had a few loose threads but not anything of structural integrity. Can be worn off the shoulders too so that a big win. Has a second little “slip” so you can’t see through the dress, so it’s thick enough. Has quite a bit of stretch to it, like I said, I do wish I would’ve ordered down a size. The black is pretty dark. It does come down past my knees so it’s a little more “modest” if you have to bend over.",

I thought it would be more practical to find a dress I can reuse and this fit the bill. I also used to be a Goth kid and that part of me will never die, so I'm happy to have it just because. I got loads of compliments as a witch.  I'm 5'4, 180 lbs with a 38DD chest and the large fit me beautifully. I'm trying to lose weight, and as I do, this dress will scale down (or up) with me because of the elastic waist. I didn't wear an underskirt but one would definitely fit and give it even more va va voom.  It's comfortable AND HAS POCKETS!  I want to buy more colors!",

The material is smooth and doesn't need an iron.  It's skirt is full and thick with a liner.  The ruffle at the bottom is cute.  The lace around the collar isn't itchy.  It even has pockets, though they are fairly small.  You could tuck away a tissue or some chapstick but nothing heavy or important.  It feels well-made and is comfortable.  My problem with the dress, however, is that I requested it before there were any pictures of women wearing it.  The dress by itself appears to have the elastic around the natural waist.  The only way that happens is if you push it off the shoulders and down to a nearly indecent level.  It is much less figure-flattering with the empire waist.",2

Fits me perfect and can be worn with a corset. The fabric feels amazing, very light, not heavy at all. The fabric is nice quality but thin enough I don’t feel sweaty wearing this during warmer months. It also has a nice puff to it, not flat and lifeless at all. Looks exactly like the picture.
