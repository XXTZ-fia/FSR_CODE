I bought him a 4XL just in case. It was pretty big. I would have liked a 3XL instead. It was just big everywhere, but ended up working out okay and not being an issue. It still looked nice and worked for his costume. I gave this 4 stars because: 1- the material is thin. In no way should you expect to wear this to actually keep warm. 2- The buttons don't actually function. It would be nice to have the option.
