The material is comfortable and has some stretch.  The only minor negative I've noticed so far is that once the drawstrings are tightened, it takes a little work to loosen them back up.

In my photo, I wasn't even wearing a padded bra, and if I did wear what I normally do with a lot of padding it might have been tight. Since I'm a small a cup, I can just imagine that moderately chested women will not fit into this. I love the way it fits with the halter look because it's flattering with my arms and shoulders. Now, this is a pet animal, lint, and hair collector on steroids. I would not wear this anywhere unless you had a lint roller in your purse or you're going to be embarrassed. It's very flowy, soft, and comfortable. You can adjust it to how you need it either yourself which can be tricky or with someone else. I think it's cute and you could change up the style based on how you wear the shoes whether it's funky and you wear high tops or you could wear chunky wedge heels, stilettos, ankle boots, or even knee-high boots. I say, just invent your own look and wear something fun.

The sizing charts show that the Large size is a 12-14 equivalent which is what my wife typically wears but this dress is a little tight. Fortunately, the material is the same soft semi-stretchy material as all the rest of the clothing we have ordered from Scarlet Darkness so it does still fit.

I sort of can't resist it. I typically get black, but I thought I needed at least a couple things of another color, so I went for brown. That's not a color I usually wear (or like very much), but this looked like a pretty color of brown, so I went for it.  The color is indeed nice. It's not too dark, nor is it bland. I have red hair and blue eyes, and surprisingly, it works with my coloring.  I love the skirt, and the dress is very well-made, as are all their garments. The ""downgrade"" from 5 stars to 4.5 on this one is purely due to the style of the bodice.  Instead of an A-Line construction, the bodice is sewn in pieces that fit snugly around the breasts (kind of like a bustier). It made me feel constricted, and I didn't think it was as comfortable or as flattering as an A-Line.  The neckline felt awkward, so I removed the ribbon, and I thought it actually looked better open or with a looser lace-up.  The skirt is full and lovely, with drawstrings on the front to raise and lower the front hem. It arrives with the drawstrings extended.  The dress comes out of the washer and a light dryer perfectly. There is a side zipper on this dress, but I was able to put it on and remove it without using the zipper (I didn't even realize it was there until I turned it inside-out to wash it!).  Overall, it's a cool dress, I'm just not jazzed about the bodice for me personally. I am sure I can come up with a solution (add a blouse over or under, change up the ribbon on the neck, etc.) and will wear it happily.  Quite honestly, as far as I've experienced, you can't go wrong with garments from Scarlet Darkness.",

The dress fit as expected and is easy to put on. I wear a large or XL in most dresses and ordered this in large and it fit well without being tight. The drawstrings in the skirt allow the length to be adjusted. The fabric in the skirt does get very bunched up once the drawstrings are tightened, so it’s not the most flattering look, but this is definitely more for a costume or statement look so the fit is what it is.  I can’t give this five stars due to the quality of fabric and the ribbon used for the neckline and the laced up area on the sides. The ribbon is very stiff and does not want to lay nicely once tied. I think it would have been a better look if cloth laces were used like those in the used in the drawstrings.  I would still recommend this for someone who is looking for a dress that could be used for multiple costumes/cosplays…it really depends on how you accessorize, it could be a pirate, a Renaissance faire look, something spooky…great for a creative person who can make it shine.",36

I’ve seen her look at countless items of clothing and decided I at least try to help and ordered this for her. Much to my surprise we both love the dress, and that rarely happens.  My wife has been dieting over summer and lost quite a bit of weight, so she needs some new clothes. She’s looked at similar dresses and I thought it looked unique and ordered it. She wasn’t crazy about it, at least until the day it arrived.  It’s a unique item as it’s described as “goth” and I can see how some might agree that it is, but I felt it was a bit more than just another black dress with laces on it. The top and bottom seem like they’re from two completely different dresses, but it works really well. The “laced bodice” of the upper portion looks great. I think it looks quite feminine with the laces evoking styles from pre-20th century fashion.  The bottom skirt is also unique, as includes laces that draw the front panel up, so it’s higher in the front than it is in the back. This allows her to wear the dress differently depending on the event. It looks far more casual with the laces drawn up than when they’re fully extended. These are my and my wife’s subjective opinions, but it’s very slick they included this feature.  The dress is very comfortable as it’s a polyester blend that allows for quite a bit of stretch. It’s not Lycra, but it has some give to it. The laces are fully functional and can be adjusted to provide the look she’s looking for.  It’s a challenge reviewing items like this as so much of the review is subjective? We honestly weren’t quite sure what to think until after she’d tried out a few different options. Once she felt understood how the laces affected the look, she started having fun playing around with different looks. Don’t make the mistake of assuming this dress is a “cosplay-ey.” This dress is nothing if not fun and I know she can’t wait to wear it.",2
