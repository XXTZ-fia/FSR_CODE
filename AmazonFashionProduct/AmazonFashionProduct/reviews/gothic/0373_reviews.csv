Bought it for Halloween but definitely going to be wearing more than just once. Super comfortable. Love the ribbons, they help form fit. Wasn't expecting the bottom layer to be completely see through but it definitely helped the dress stay down in the wind. It fits to size, and beautiful",
Ashley,Gothic Lolita at it’s finest,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38KEW031E4EJI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C1GP3MS7,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 1, 2023",Color: BlackSize: Large,,I love the style and elegance of the dress. The underskirt tulle is a bit itchy but that’s nothing wearing a slip or bodysuit underneath wouldn’t fix. The lace and ribbons are so shiny and beautiful.,2

The ribbons are sturdy. I got xxl and I feel like it's as much as a size xxxl. I usually wear xxl or xxl, so this fit me perfectly for plus size. This is US size. Once I tied the ribbons and fix the dress up a bit, it looked great. I'll wear a petticoat underneath it and that'll make it look even better. The material is sturdy and not cheap looking. I think it'll last.",
