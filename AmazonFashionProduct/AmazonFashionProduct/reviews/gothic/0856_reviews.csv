Pairs very cute with warm leggings and even a long-sleeved shirt underneath during the winter with some cute combat boots! Definitely recommend.",

My biggest objection: the collar is sewn as though the front of the dress is intended for the back. I noticed in the review photos that a lot of people choose to wear these with the V-side on the front. Having tried it on, I realize it's because the front panel is measured so it feels awkward and tight across the throat, making that the only comfortable way to wear it.",

I bought it to wear on my upcoming trip to Mexico and it’s going to be perfect to walk around the resort in!  However, it is not true to color. The picture I included is of the “army green” option and it looks almost black. I can see the faintest suggestion of green because I know to look for it, but if I didn’t know to look for it, I’d just think it was black. Kinda disappointing because I’ve been on an earthy green kick lately and really loved the color of the army dress in the advertisement. Oh, well.",11

Whatever feeling I have while wearing it, I like.I have not had problems with the lace catching on things, but that's more from mindfulness than anything else.  I think the lace is well-made enough.  I ordered in a size that stretches *just* right for my body (a miracle, given I am essentially a rectangular prism that only dreams of hourglasses), and have not seen any stressed threads so far.  I think it will be worth the 40usd I paid for it, especially as I'm not one to dispose of clothing unless it becomes too worn to wear or repair.Regarding the confusion, I looked at the pictures, and there doesn't seem to be agreement with which side the front is.

But quality is questionable.  It's very stretchy, but delicate, so you have to be careful with how you handle it.  It snags easily.  Also, order one size up, because if you wear it too tight, it will stretch the fabric too much and will end up breaking the fibers.  It's better that it's a little loose, or that it will not be stretched excessively.  I ordered one size up, I was concerned with it not fitting my chest.  And it barely fits without forcing the dress to stretch.  I am a 38D/40C, I got the XL.  Fit a little loose on the waist but it was just barely right over my chest.  It still looks really nice.
