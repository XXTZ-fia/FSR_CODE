I will look for a much larger Victorian umbrella that I can use if it rains.,

It has a lot of details and appointments that make it awesome for cosplay or for every day use. The dark material is thick enough for shade, but not full blackout, and the construction is solid throughout. It opens and closes easily, and the tie is strong enough to last repeated tying and untying. The ribs are solid, and don't feel like they're about to bend or break. The handle is solid, and easy to hold with no jiggles or wiggles. The fixture works well and holds the umbrella open without slipping.  This isn't a rain umbrella, it's a parasol, or a sun shade. The goth style is well done here, and this is a great accessory for the girl who has everything, or to really add a polished finishing touch to a victorian or goth look. Highly unique and recommended.  Best Features - Quality Construction (Not Cheap Costume Junk)",

Just know what you're getting into. The parasol is child-sized. Very small, and it's pretty cheaply made, but it's really cute as an accessory to a gothic lolita outfit, or if you need it for cosplay purposes. People probably aren't going to be inspecting it up close, and if they are, then you might need something a little nicer.  It might be too small to be effective for using it to shade from the sun for some people, but for others it might be a good size. For me, it works, but I'm pretty child-sized myself LOL. I love pairing this with some of my darker colored lolita outfits, especially in the Florida sun. The black end of the handle is covered in lace, and that's honestly a tactile nightmare for me, but it is a cute touch.",

Sadly I was disappointed when I saw the size and quality of it. Don't get me wrong, this is adorable and a great addition to a one-time outfir choice. It's durability is not there nor is it's practicality. It is too small to be used as a normal use item and the lace and stitching will not last over maybe 2 short uses. Excellent costume addition, poor regular wear item. Definitely DO NOT recommend if you are plus size or have hips, it will look like a joke like it does with me.

It's pretty small - it's more for looks than functionality, but it still works. I just wish the lace flower on top of mine was a bit bigger or puffier. It was small, like a rose not quite fully bloomed. But overall, I still like the umbrella. Lastly, the handlebar had fingerprints all over it, so I wiped it down and the wipe came out brown. Just fyi.",

It is fairly small, but the photo shows that it is not a massive umbrella and the listing does not state its size, so I cannot say that it has been deceptive in that nature, it will provide shade and that is why I wanted it. I am an old fashion vintage goth and also I am exceptionally pale and very sensitive to the sun and due to some exciting health issues wearing sunscreen causes...well...let's just say I could easily fool people into thinking I am a vampire. Parasols are great on days that are too hot for cover-up clothing, but it helps if they are a bit bigger, so this works more as a fashion accessory, but it does function for sun.  The construction is a little meh, the lace on the handle and the incredibly sad rose on top is scratchy and just not great, likely I am going to just remove both so I don't have to deal with them. The ruffles on the top are deflated and a little sad and do not look like the full floofy ruffles in the photos. The actual umbrella part is is super cheap, the material is loud and I am certain I could easily snap the ribbing if I tried. I had a parasol just like this one as a kid and it hits the nostalgia for me, but it just feels a little sad.  But I do like the way it looks, because it is fairly cheap looking I am not worried about taking it with me when I go hiking or errands that are more heavy duty, it is not a formal parasol, it is small enough that I could take it out without it getting in the way, and if it gets snagged on a branch and slightly damaged then I don't really care.",

I would have absolutely loved it, if it were bigger. I’m 6.1 and looking at myself in the mirror holding this, it kind of looked silly, My daughter is only 13 and I know she would love it, but with her 5.7, this umbrella is probably too small for her as well. I think if you are a very petite woman (as the model must be, as the umbrella looks regular sized in the video and pictures on the product page), you can make this work. This parasol opens easily and seems to stay put just by the pressure from the stretchers. There is a slit as with  regular umbrellas where normally a spring piece clicks in to keep an umbrella open, but that spring part is not present on this parasol. So, I hope it will not start sliding down in the future.",

Finally, I’m glad to have acquired this stunning one that puts many of my others to shame. When opened, it’s definitely on the small side compared to some modern umbrellas, so it pairs perfectly with a dainty, feminine (and goth) outfit. Though I haven’t been able to test how it holds up to the rain that has not been coming, it does feel to be made of a standard, thin umbrella material with lace, ruffle, and ribbon embellishments (it even has a tiny black rose atop the tied-off ribbon at both the very top and the handle). It works well for the main reason I’m using it, which is to protect my skin from harsh sunlight (while looking gorgeous). The handle, beneath its pretty, lace sleeve, seems likely to be plastic, while the central bar and spokes are all your standard umbrella metal. To open and close it, you simply push or pull the central piece, which has no button to press. The hinges lock it in place when fully opened, and it hangs pretty loosely when closed, so you’ll want to fasten it shut with the surprisingly loose-fitting, snap-button ribbon attached to it in the usual way. It has no telescoping abilities, so its only maneuver is to open and close, which means it looks gorgeous and classic when closed and carried. Overall, I’m completely satisfied with this fabulous parasol that perfectly complements my wardrobe’s aesthetic.",3

It is the size of a standard child's umbrella. I have shown it beside a compact adult umbrella for size comparison (pic 1).  The fabric is cheap. I've never felt an umbrella or parasol with material as thick as this is. Even so, the material is somehow slightly see through. If I put my fingers against the under side the fabric I can see them through it. The black roses appear to be attached by melting them on to the ribbons (pic 2). The sheer fabric that makes up the ruffles feels like really cheap plastic. The lace is the best bit, being fairly soft in comparison to the rest of the fabrics. The ribbons are okay. However, the sewing is sloppy with unclipped threads and unfinished lace edges (pic 3) The tips of the umbrella are a cheap, brittle plastic.  The bit that holds the umbrella open has nothing to hold it in place except a slight thickening of the shaft. You only have to nudge the the piece that holds it up to make the whole thing fold again. I would expect this to get worse with time. It is very poorly done.  If you only want this for a photo shoot, go for it. Everyone else, you can do better.",
