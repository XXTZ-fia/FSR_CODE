For the most part, the ring looks exactly as advertised with the only difference being that the eyes of the skulls are orange, not red like the stone on top. In spite of that, the ring was very comfortable and didn't feel heavy. I wore it for 8 straight hours and the plating kept my finger from turning green. However, I did notice a part on the ring near the gem where the plating was already coming off, so I wouldn't recommended wearing this ring all the time if you want it to last.",

It’s beautiful and stone is shiny and so pretty. The only issue is, it’s fragile. A tiny stone fell out after about 30 minutes of wearing it. Luckily I saw it sitting there otherwise, it’s so small I never would have found it. I put it back in place with clear nail polish and coated the entire ring 2-3 times except for the large stone. It’s keeping the paint from chipping which it did start too a little but it’s not noticeable. Even with the nail polish it’s still not an every day ring if you want it to last any amount of time. It will last for Halloween but I’m not sure how long I will survive passed that.",2
