Jo A. Causey,It's for a costume,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3C6QYOBEJ5VFR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DG89NXS9,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 19, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: 2022055-wh,Verified Purchase,"I bought the Extra Large because many clothing products from other countries are smaller than the US and while this does fit through the chest area (which was a concern), the shoulders are too far off my natural shoulder line so I will take it in since I can sew.  I find it easier to adjust already made garments than to try and sew from scratch as the cost of fabric and laces is so much more expensive than it used to be.  I like that the back has lacing and is adjustable too.  I like where it hits me under the breasts and the length of the sleeves is perfect for what I want to use it for.  I bought a similar blouse for my granddaughter (it was a plane white t-shirt type shirt from Amazon) and adjusted it to match.  I'm happy with my purchase overall.My bust measurement is 39 1/2"" and underneath is 30"", my sleeve length is 22"" and the shirt itself is 25"" as you can see from the pic it extends past my hand.  The neck is not tight even though it is a stand up type of collar.  The diameter of my neck is 13"" and the shirt is 19"" from the button to the button hole.  The pic is unaltered but like I said I plan to take in the shoulder area and add pads so the puckering stands out more.",28
