Music Lover,Victorian Era Dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33E4UDNLJJ2OI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCKBH2ZW,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2025",Color: RedSize: Large,Verified Purchase,I purchased this dress to sing in a Victorian dinner theater at our church.  It came wrinkled but the wrinkles released when I wet it down in the shower a couple of times and let it dry.  I purchased a steamer to use for next year.  It did take quite a bit of time to receive this item so order early if you need it.  The material is very nice and high quality.,

It’s simplicity makes it look elegant and the pearl detail is a pretty touch. I ordered it to wear for Halloween but I would definitely wear it to a formal event, as well.",
