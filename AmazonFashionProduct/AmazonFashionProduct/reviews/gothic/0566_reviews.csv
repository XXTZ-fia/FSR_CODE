SO many compliments,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU0JQ4PHU6P8S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4PR38BF,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 15, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Red,Verified Purchase,"I tend to buy things and then 'fix' them... AKA add to them, modify them, embellish them etc. I sew but dont always have time to make the complete item. I ordered this expecting to have to level it up. BUT its gorgeous as is.  Completely worth the cost. Its lined and the color is a very deep rich red.  Its a thick sturdy coat that holds its shape.  I'm 5'9"", 190lbs with broad shoulders and long arms and this fit perfectly (i usually wear a 10-12 or L/XL in street clothing).  It gathered at my waist to give me a nice figure over my costume.  Highly suggest this item!  SO very very pleased with it. I had so many compliments.  Just buy it!!!",6

Velveteen-like outer fabric in a dark burgundy and a  polyester lining in black, with black braid trim very well done. Worth the money! It's for my granddaughter. She will love it. I had to get the xxlarge and glad I did. She wears a 14-16.  I am making a long white satin pirate shirt, with a lace center ruffle and blousy sleeves with ruffled cuffs, and adding a decorated black top hat, black lace gloves and mask, long dangling zirconia earrings, and a black corset waist belt to pull in the long waisted pirate shirt. It's all a surprise for her. I adore her and love to dress her up with great costumes. I might add a shiny  silver shoulder bag-purse. All she has to add is a pair of jeans or black tights and black boots. I hope she likes it.",13
