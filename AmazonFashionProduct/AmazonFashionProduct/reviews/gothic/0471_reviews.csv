Also they scratch super easily and came with a nasty ammonia smell. It made my skin turn red and itchy, not sure if thats an allergic reaction.

I gave them a test run around my house, and overall they seem pretty good. I did notice a bit of glue on the right shoe however, I wasn’t too worried about it. The support is great and I ordered a size down, i’m normally a 9 but ordered an 8.5, i’d say go a size down for narrow feet. The heel isn’t that high, and it’s easy to walk in. I read a bunch of the one star reviews, concerns about the top disconnecting and the strap at the top falling off or breaking, for good wear, don’t tighten the top strap super tight, that’s just for show!! it’s removable, tightening it puts more force when you walk which causes the disconnect of the top from the bottom. Go about medium tight. I just got these today, so how would I know this? Well, I was walking around my house in them and realized the strap was pulling on my ankle, which was really uncomfortable. I figured that’s the problem people are having. Super cute! Would recommend!",3

My only warning is that I'm a size 4 normally but being that the smallest size was 5, I usually buy size 5 and put inserts in them.

I tried wearing these with the straps a little loose, a little tight and just snug and each way would still rub holes in my socks or different parts of my feet. These were not ill fitted generally, the rivets will just rub through everything no matter what pretty much because the backs aren’t sealed. I would maybe just use nail polish or glue to seal them but after the straps broke I just gave up. Everyone else was shocked looking down at my newly opened socks with holes as the event went on and it was embarrassing. They all told me to just throw them away when I get home, which is what I will do  Some people told me they were super cute though, in the morning before the holes were worn in. And they are super cute, so I give 1 star back haha",2

The size chart the seller offers shows up to 10 so I was kinda bummed to see it end on a half size. If the seller could increase their sizes more they'd definitely have gotten a higher score.  As for the shoe: Exactly as advertised. Black patent shoe on a platform. Fit was pretty good but a little tight and I wish they had a half size more. The cost was excellent for what you're getting which isn't fancy but is decent quality.  Packaging the shoes arrived in was a plain black box but I appreciated it wasn't one of the smaller boxes where shoes are tightly condensed but instead had plenty of room so that there was no creasing or disfigurement of the shoes within. Shoes were well stuffed with paper to help maintain the structure of the box. Shoe fit comfortably and there was no strain in terms of the buckle and strap. Little tight by the toe but I'll stretch it out a little and I'm sure it'll be fine.  So far I like the shoe and would look at the seller's other options since they almost seem reasonably priced.,
