The kids love the hat! The goggles can be carefully removed and have real glass lenses. Definitely not safety goggles, but I was not expecting them to be a separate piece. It was a pleasant surprise! All of the little decorative bits and pieces have stayed on through two years of programming and being tossed around. The programs last an hour or two, which is about the amount of time I can wear this hat comfortably. The hat is a standard size and I have a medium sized head. I’d say it fits pretty well, but the hat is oval shaped and I have a round head, though, so after about two hours of wearing it it starts to rub. I get a funny little red mark in the middle of my forehead…But it is well worth it for the smiles and fun!",
