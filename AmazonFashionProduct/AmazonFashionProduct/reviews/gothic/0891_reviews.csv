First, it didn’t arrive as a dress. It was a corset only so the saying it is a dress is a falsehood.  Second, and even more importantly, it immediately broke when I tried to latch the first latch. This is absolute junk and you should stay far, far away from the product. Photos attached to show you exactly how poorly this product was made.",

I’m a L/XL regular but I saw everyone saying size up so I did by a lot, but the dress still was tight? Ended up not being able to wear it. I also hated the look of it why were there 2 different fabrics? This dress is not worth the price honestly, If I could go back and save my 30+ dollars I would.

She was an October baby so we throw a Halloween themed party every year and the kids love dressing up. Each year we pick a theme and send out the invitation a few months advance so they can get their costumes. This one was a bittersweet year because we will only have one more year of planning her birthday party and then she’s off to college the next year. Back to the costume the size fit her perfectly, the color was as shown, the material wasn’t scratchy, or anything she never complained about it once. The top is a corset so she had to be tied into it and she said she felt like she was in the oh olden days but she loved it 😆 so we would definitely buy this again if we needed another one in the future! Great costume!!",

I got a size XL and had to undo the corset ties in the back to 90% capacity for it to fit. I'm a size 36 DD bra size, so if you want to remain modest, you will have to wear an undershirt as shown in the picture. Overall, I love it and can't wait to wear it!",

The skirt however does not have much give. I'm a size 12 and it just fit around my waist. I got a 3x because I am a 36 D up top and broad ribs. Overall it fit just right.,2

I’m 5’4 128 lbs. Athletic build. 36D/27 inch waist/37 inch hips. The large size fit great. I did have to let the stings out in the back of the corset to get the corset zipped. But then I was able to tighten the strings to a better fit. The skirt is slightly loose in the waist but you cannot tell once the corset is on. I prefer the slightly loose fit as it’s much more comfortable to me this way. I normally wear a medium due to my chest size. If you are on the fence for sizing, follow the toe size charts to determine which way to go. I almost purchased the medium but I know it would have been too small now.",6
