Alanna J.,Love it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZNIO6CG3BDEB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074169RKF,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 2, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"It is made out if the cheap polyester. It's really stretchy. Comfy and fit me pretty well. I'm 47"" bust and 40"" high waisted. 5'9"" and 225 lbs. The only issue for me is the star. It's not tacked down on both sides of the seam. And the straps are a little loose and stretch easily. I will be sewing these areas to fit me better. Overall it's a nice dress. I like to wear high waisted belts with most of my dresses. Looks nice. And the bottom on some of these online dresses look full and end up arriving more straight and this one has flare to it.",2

It’s not bad, but it’s not great. The real issue is sizing and fit.. the dress sits funny and almost lopsided because one of the straps is much longer than the others. I’m going to try to tailor it myself and fix the issue, but this isn’t immediately wearable and that’s an issue.",
Ams F,It’s super cute but has some drawbacks…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39CV519W7IYA5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074169RKF,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 12, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I love this dress however the length is way longer than it shows in the photo unless the model is just really tall. For size reference, I’m a size large or a 12, 5’2”, 180 pounds and bought the large however the tag says size small on it? This dress goes almost to my calves which is a little long for me so I just pull it up, tuck in in the waist band and secure it with a belt. It literally looks like a church dress with the length which bugs me but like I said, I just tuck it in which you can see in the photos. It’s soft material and not itchy at all and I’m high sensory so I can tell immediately if something is going to set me off or not (I’m AuDHD). This fits nicely however the one complaint I have is the straps don’t adjust so if you don’t have the heavy top or shoulders, it’s gonna slide down. I haven’t had that issue yet but I can see it if you have smaller shoulders and a more petite frame like my mom has. I definitely would recommend this dress for the price (I got it on Amazon Prime Days for twenty bucks)! It’s lightweight and comfortable to wear all day or night! Pair it with some tights or knee socks and you’re good to go. I prefer this with a sweater as it helps with pulling it all together as an outfit. I got my strawberry cardigan on Amazon as well so if you’re looking for one, just look up strawberry cardigan. Either way, about the dress, it’s beautiful and such a statement piece! The last photo is of what it looks like without a belt or being hiked up :(  it looks grandma-ish and long not to mention it makes me look frumpy too. Definitely get this if you’re a tall person but if you do get this and you’re my height or shorter, tuck it in your waistband and it solves the issue.",2
April Brannen,"Slinky material, great fit, better without zipper though.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JD552ROK7ENC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074169RKF,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 20, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"As others have commented, the material is very sheer, so definitely get some pasties or black coverage for the chest area. The skirt length is way longer than I was hoping for, but I already planned on doing some alterations to take the zipper out, so I'll probably go ahead and hem it as well. Great purchase if you're looking for a low price concert/festival dress!",

The length is fine for 5""2 and comes to just past my knees. Shows a lot of cleavage and I don't think you have to worry to much about nip slip unless you have very big boob's. It seems fine for 38 C. Doesn't look see through. The black isn't real dark and kind of looks green or gray. The straps are non adjustable, and might run big on more petite frams as there alittle big on me but with some sewing I can fix the straps. Seem great for plus size and your wallet 👌",

It's actually perfect, I'm about 5'2"" and it hits perfectly at the knee, it's a nice fabric, a soft and flowy kind of jersey material. It's very flattering and has a just bit of stretch. My normal size is usually L or XL, but after reading reviews I decided to order a size up (XXL) and it's absolutely perfect. If you like a tighter fit then you could probably do your standard size, there's also a side zipper that would help with a tighter fit for those ladies with a larger chest area so you don't have to slide it over and hope it stretches enough.",4

The dress is pretty nice but it was a bit tight and it flatten my chest but not by alot. It's long enough to almost cover my knees.
