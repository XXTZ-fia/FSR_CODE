This thing is perfect. I've always wanted to dress a little more gothy/punky/dark cozy but it's hard being plus size. I love everything about this. It can adjust, it feels good but light too, it looks sturdy, the ribbon and loops seem sturdy. Highly recommend",

It was slightly snug but had good stretch to it. The straps were a little short. It had two holes to adjust them but I wanted them a little longer so I cut an extra hole in each strap because there is a little excess fabric, and then the straps fit great after that. It was comfortable and breathable. Perfect for the look is was going for to my concert. Felt flattering.",2

Jessica,A bit long but I love it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HJEPXEGTW958/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBYNDCH7,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 23, 2024",Color: Black-5Size: Large Plus,Verified Purchase,"I'm about 5'5.5"" and 188ish lbs. Normally a US14.  Generally I like my skirts to hit a few inches above my knee. This sits an inch or two under my bust and ends pretty much right at my knees. It's a stretchy swimsuit-ish material so not tight at all. Honestly I could have gone a size down but then I don't think I'd be so excited to wear it out. I think if I pair it with some chunky heels and a tank top it'll be perfect",
