Reza M.,Decent style and design,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYF9UY302BW2G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4SJZ4P2,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"The design of these Vintage Gothic Sword Earrings is really unique and stylish, perfect for adding a bold touch to any outfit. However, the quality left a bit to be desired. The earrings feel slightly flimsy, and the rhinestones aren’t as secure as I expected. They’re great for occasional use or costumes, but I wouldn’t rely on them for regular wear. Overall, they look nice but could be more durable for the price.",

They aren't too big or bulky and as as easy to put in as regular earrings. I will update over time as to whether they turn my ears green or not but overall I do like them.",

I came across these and decided these were it. I LOVE them. They fit perfectly in my ear and look so unique. They are smaller than the photo depicts but that was a plus in my eyes. They do get caught occasionally in my hair if I leave it down, but not an issue for me personally.",4

It's a standard taper backing. Also, it's not a perfect fit. Yes it keeps the ""hilt"" in my ear, but the taper backing wobbles. I looked in the mirror and it looked like the ""sword"" was crooked. Both of them. Trash. Rather disappointed.",
