Anne,It’s very flimsy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UQQ75Z2VECLK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XYQXYC7,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 6, 2024",Size: SmallColor: White,Verified Purchase,"This item didn’t work out. It was very large (I ordered a medium) and I was swimming in it. The material is thin, and the piece resembled more of a lab coat than anything else.  I would say only order it, if it’s not your main piece. And don’t size up!",
Daniel P. Lotz,Not worth it and extremly small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X0QDGAIX93X1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XYQXYC7,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 5, 2024",Size: 3X-LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"The prize is low, yes, but still I expected a little better.

Yes,Buyer beware,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MNLIHUAPQXHH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XYQXYC7,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 23, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Green,Verified Purchase,This is a costume piece that can look good WITH EFFORT. Tailoring is a must for tall and skinny people. The material overall is cheap for sure but looks good and is easy to work with. The vest part of the costume piece is way too long and looked odd until I shortened it. Great item for experienced costume wearers,

Such good quality and perfect for my Robotnik costume, it inspired me to buy the yellow one for another costume I'm working on, and let me tell you, the yellow version is awful, and thin, and cheaper quality than even costumes at Halloween. Totally Not worth almost $20 more than it was 3 years ago.",5
