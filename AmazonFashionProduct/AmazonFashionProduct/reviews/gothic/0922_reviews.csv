JustAnotherFloridaMan,"Pretty shade of blue, fit can be a little fiddly in the torso",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15EMQKNHWIN92/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9BTYFVH,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 23, 2024",,,"At first the teen didn't think this would fit, not realizing how adjustable the bodice could be.  But once we pulled the neckline drawsting tighter it was far more comfortable to wear and it didn't have any accidental exposures.The fabric is a machine washable, soft poly blend.  We used a steamer and any shipping wrinkles came right out.  Personally I think a steamer is a lot easier on fabric like this than trying to iron it on a lower setting.  We found the blue to be an accurate shade and opaque.The trickiest fit for buyers is in the bodice itself.  It is designed to imitate the look of a waist cincher, but it's all a design trick.  It's cute, but if the underbust line doesn't hit right it can look off.  I find myself wishing they had made that ""waist cincher"" piece a little shorter.  Anyone with a short torso, a low bust point, or prefers to wear sport bras may have difficulty getting the look they want.  This dress really cries out for an underwire or push up bra.",
Cassandra Shine,Served it's purpose,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35SYHULBSULQ3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9BTYFVH,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 16, 2024",Size: LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"I got this dress for a Celtic fair and it worked well with my idea. Since I got white, you can see through to the pockets and underwear. I wore skin toned undergarments. I am a 36 B for my bra size and the area was pretty loose - that is why I had it off my shoulders. The dress has a built in corset, but it was not tight for me. I had my own corset to add. The fit can potentially feel a bit off/loose depending on body type.",
Tina,"Very Comfy, but flattering",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUKKAG0OABZOD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9BTYFVH,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 14, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"It feels like soft cotton material, kinda wrinkly, but not noticeable in black.  There is a leg slit on the left leg.  There feels like there is some plastic corset boning in the front, but it bends so it's not uncomfortable for me at all.  And the chest has a keyhole, but it's not obvious, which is nice.  The neckline in the front has ties that actually work.  I was scared at first because the neckline appeared so loose when I first tried it on, but I was able to tie the neckline exactly right to fit my chest! Back has stretchy smocking.",

Pachycephalosaurus,"Weird sizing, material not breathable",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28BM6GFA9GQZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9BTYFVH,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 6, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Beige,,"I really expected to love this dress, as I have several other garments from this company that have been great. However, this one just didn't live up to my expectations. The material is not breathable, and I felt like it was trapping sweat underneath. I was planning to wear it to a Ren Faire, but could tell immediately that it would not feel good worn outside all day.  The fit is weird. There is a stretchy panel at the back, but the midsection still felt too tight, and the boning placement was awkward and uncomfortable for me. The arms felt small as well, and I could not move my arms fully as the fabric would pull too tight.",
AJ,Cute dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MXOIBF5818TE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9BTYFVH,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 5, 2024",,,"Review of Scarlet Darkness Renaissance Dress with Slit Ruched Bust Cottagecore Midi Dresses. I got this dress in green and was a little disappointed that it was duller in color than the advertising photos suggested, with more of an olive cast to it. The dress also has some unexpected structure beneath the bust, but this serves more as decoration than a functional feature. In fact, its primary function seemed to be to make it harder to get the dress on! The fabric was stiff, not soft and flowy like I was expecting, and I wish the sleeves had more ""poofiness"" to them and that the slit went juuuuuust a tad higher on the leg, as it seems to end at a weird place on me. I also do NOT like the pockets, as their placement just makes my hips look wider (and I need NO HELP with that). All that being said, I am certain it is a nice dress on the bodies of others! I cannot see myself wearing this dress on the daily, but might pull it out for my next Ren Faire visit.",
Lisa Y,Pretty old fashioned looking dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OE59160QZL02/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9BTYFVH,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 5, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"This is a really pretty, quaint old fashioned looking dress. It does remind you of something from the renaissance days. I loved the style and definitely love the deep black color. The material is really lightweight and thin, definitely more of a summer dress because it is so lightweight. It's comfortable wearing and is made well enough, good seams and stitching but because it's so thin not sure how long it would last through the years with washing. It has a drawstring adjustable top, easy to open or close based on your bust needs or the look you're going for. Overall happy with it and would recommend",
Amanda B.,"Looks good on, but see through",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LMP28D6REOE1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9BTYFVH,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 31, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: White,,"This is a cute dress.

Great for wearing underneath, but you may want to wear a slip if you are going to wear it by itself. Cute, would recommend.",3

Hailey,it ripped when I tried it on,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVUWCCSF8J7BG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9BTYFVH,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 12, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Beige,,"I wanted to love this dress so much because its stunning. However, the pockets are in the worst possible spot which makes it just the right amount of too tight on my hips and the dress ripped along the seam when I tried it on for the first time. Which is incredibly unfortunate because I really wanted to wear it to an upcoming event. If they had just put the pockets a little bit lower it would be perfect. The zipper is nice, the pockets are deep, and the boning isnt uncomfortable. The tie on the chest is absolutely beautiful and the length as well as the sleeves were gorgeous. I just wish it hadn't ripped ):",
DMT,Lots of Bust Adjustment for all Sizes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3T3TU3TN2NT7B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9BTYFVH,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 12, 2024",,,"I am very much pear shaped--carrying most of my weight in my thighs and bum. I also have larger arms, but my waist is smaller. I am small chested and had to really cinch the bust to make it work. Haha, maybe I need a water bra or pushup bra for this. This dress is as flattering as a dress can be on me right now. For reference I am 5'4"" weighing 170 pounds but am active shedding weight. I really like the material. It is light and airy but with a built in slip for modesty, is a beautiful color, and will look nice with the shawl my grandma crocheted for me. This is another fine quality Scarlet Darkness product! It is great for the Ren Faire, or since Cottage core is very ""in"" right now, great for every day. I will wear it to church. (I admit, though, I've never paid much attention to fashion. I wear what I am comfortable in regardless of style. This just happens to be in style now.)",5
