The fit is another issue—it's hard to imagine it looking good on many different body types.  Worse still, the dress is practically see-through, making it nearly unwearable without additional layers underneath.

Because this dress - oh my gosh, this dress is so darn cute!  At the time of this review, I see the seller is running a coupon sale, and you should absolutely snatch this dress up - on sale or not - because it's so figure flattering for multiple body types!  I really like that I can wear this on or off the shoulder, although due to my sizing up, this does want to be off the shoulder very badly. It's good for a quick throw it on and look cute, or dress it up to suit different aesthetics from a Renn Faire inspired look with a floral print corset belt, to a more goth look with a black waspie corset and leather strappy harnesses and belts.  The wrinkles steam out easily, and I already know this fabric washes well (shortest gentle cycle the machine has, cold water, hang to dry is how I do it) and will hold up to multiple wears. Most of my Scarlett Darkness pieces have been worn on repeat for years now, and still look brand new, and I anticipate this dress being no exception.",5

I do think that the dress is a little overpriced, but grumpy teen does not. Since she'd be the one to price that kind of stuff, I'll go with her and say it's not. The corset isn't a real corset, there's nothing to tighten, same with the bow in the front. They're decoration only. The material is nice.

ShoeFanatic,"Faux Corset, Beautiful Color",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NPAY561OXONN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7SJBKZ7,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 31, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Dark Green,,"I love the color! It is a beautiful, consistent shade of emerald/evergreen with nearly matching lining.  The fit for me was slightly larger than expected. The smocking on the back has a moderate amount of give that would allow me to size down (from a medium to a small). I was able to put the garment on easily without using the zipper because the smocking made the dress almost stretchy towards the back. I am about 5'1"", so if I purchased again I would get a small to have a tighter fit. Even without sizing down, the dress is so comfortable! The fabric flows beautifully and the lining + the hem hangs nice and neatly.  The bodice has a faux corset feel because you can't adjust or tighten the bodice in any way, the two strings at the neckline don't adjust, they are sewn in place, all you can do it tie them into a bow or untie them. The bodice is as is, so that's why if you want a snug fit, I suggest sizing down a size from your normal dress size.  The pockets on this dress were also uneven. One pocket (the left) is significantly deeper than the other (the right). The right pocket seemed to be caught in the seam of the lining, making it smaller than the left. I am used to tailoring my clothes because of my height, so I can fix and restitch that, and tighten the bodice at the size seams. But others mayn't be able to, and none of us should really have to, which is why I deducted one star- the irregular scale of the pockets, and the lack of corseting ability- the dress is really ""AS IS"" and you won't be able to adjust anything unless you or someone you know can sew.  I would buy this dress again though, knowing what to expect. It is very pretty, and even with the few hiccups, still nicely made. It will need steaming upon arrival, but overall it is a great dress- whether for date night, celebrations (graduations, recitals, family/friends milestone, etc.) or dressing up in the Medieval style. I definitely recommend!",2
Kirsten Brand,Gorgeous Dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S7F9PAI5K0JD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7SJBKZ7,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 31, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Dark Green,,"I've been intrigued by this brand for awhile now and I'm so glad I finally got the opportunity to try one of their dresses out! I got this one in green and I'm in love with it.  I'm on the thicker side with a very exaggerated hourglass figure, so I definitely expected this to fit well in the bust and waist area. I was very apprehensive about the length, though. Being a bigger girl, I wasn't sure how this dress would look on me at this length; whether it would be short, or not. Thankfully it comes down to about the knee on me- and although I'm definitely out of my comfort zone there, it looks great. It fits amazingly in all other ways! When I tried it on and came out of my bedroom my family audibly gasped. That's got to be a good thing!  I feel great in it, too. Not just by way of confidence, but the fabric is so light and comfortable- it's not silk, but it's definitely smooth in a way that feels comparable to silk to me, and it breathes so well. So while it's a long sleeved dress, you might be able to wear it on the right day during the warmer months without so much as feeling uncomfortable with the temperature. The sleeves are built so that you can arrange them on your shoulders or off, depending on what you're most comfortable with.  I'm absolutely in love with this dress and really glad I got the chance to finally check this brand out. There's another dress of theirs I've had my eye on but have been too worried about how I'd like it to give myself permission to just grab it- now that I have an idea of the quality of clothing this brand puts out, I'm going to grab it ASAP!  Seriously, just buy it. You're going to love it. It's so beautiful and comfortable!",3

She said it makes her body look amazing, goes great with her boots, and makes her feel like a fairy princess wandering the woods. She said she never wants to take it off. In the pictures she sent, she looked gorgeous in it! Great dress!",
hjh,I love this brand. SCARLET DARKNESS IS THE BEST!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2016LA9L46Z3J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7SJBKZ7,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 29, 2024",Size: MediumColor: White,,"I love Scarlet Darkness clothes. You cant beat the price for the quality of these clothes. There arent many places that sell era clothing and the ones that do are so expensive and the quality is not even close to SD. These clothes are sewn to perfection. The sizes are spot on, they are the best at what they do. 5 stars and then some~!",

It fits beautifully. The waist is defined and the bodice moulds beautifully to the chest. The top can be worn on the shoulders or off for a versatile look.  The length is perfect and hits just above the knees.  It's very flattering and my daughter is obsessed.  Can be worn as regular style or cosplay.",

Nay Family,Fits well and it is true to size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2V4KZ9BDEGR06/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7SJBKZ7,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 23, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"This dress is made of 95% Polyester, 5% Elastane and it has a ""crispness"" to it and holds its shape well. The bow in the front is nice but it is not functional. It's merely for decoration so don't expect that it is going to tighten around your bust. Order the size that fits best for you. The length falls right above the knees. I like that you can move the top off your shoulders a bit. It's completely opaque. It's a very cute dress.",
