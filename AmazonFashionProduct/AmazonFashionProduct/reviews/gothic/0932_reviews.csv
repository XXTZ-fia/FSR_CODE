Maria M.,"If you don't have a sewing machine, don't buy it.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGB6UL1CLZY4A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Color: Tops Crop RedSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"If you don't have a sewing machine, don't buy it. The bottom lace is attached very poorly, with separate, rare stitches. By the end of the first day of wearing it had almost come off. The good news is that I have a sewing machine. Otherwise, it's a very nice top.",
Cody and Rebecah,Runs small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VTU818WBNS2Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 29, 2024",Color: Tops CropSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,Runs small but decent quality,
Shaer,Please read,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WGW4W7YJCAYH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2024",Color: Tops CropSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"Unfortunately for busty girls/women I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it is a little tight, the material is on the cheap side so it won’t last you long, and last but not least the top overall is slightly uncomfortable. I would have to worry about accidentally ripping off the lace, I forgot to mention it does stain when put with other colored clothing🥲( that might have been on me though so please don’t take my word for that part!) the top is cute for a short little trip though so you know, just have fun and feel like a baddie with it ❤️",2
Jamie,LOVE THIS TOP,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31SZP3OL1KSMJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2024",Color: Tops CropSize: Small,Verified Purchase,It’s really cute.

Lex,Runs small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HWKYA3PWPJTG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 14, 2024",Color: Tops CropSize: Large,Verified Purchase,Runs small and is really tight in the part with the lace around the mid area. I am a mid size girlie and I couldn’t fit it around my middle and barely got it over my boobs so def go up at least one size maybe two to be safe. The material is not stretchy at all so there isn’t really any give unless you pop seams.,
Gabrielle,Sizing is horrible,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CH4XX4F7KOCH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"2.0 "," the United States "," July 9, 2024",Color: Tops CropSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,Doesn’t fit like a XXL. Quality is cheap and very fragile. Not comfortable because its too tight in certain areas around my bust/waist.,
Paige P,Runs small but great quality!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S2V8Y6KFDK1T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 6, 2024",Color: Tops Crop RedSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,Love everything about this top! I wish it went one or two more sizes up to not ride up over my boobs  but it worked ok for what I got it for.,
Reiley Freels,cute but the lace at the bottom on the waist is low quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YGKTOIASN1LQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 9, 2023",Color: Tops CropSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"the lace that is at the bottom of the shirt was pretty low quality, it started falling off on the first wear. also, order a size up, it was super tight with a size that normally fits me well. other than that, the shirt it super cute and the sleeves are nice, so far it just seems like the lace on the bottom is the only real problem.",

JD Teater,"If you are larger chested, order a size up",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OE17WVX9BGBB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 31, 2023",Color: Tops CropSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I am 5'3, 170 pounds and ordered a extra-large size. Not only was it like putting on a latex shirt (as it is made of a velvety material, awfully hot), the seams that outline the chest did not line up with my (c sized) chest. Taking it off was absolutely miserable, too. However, it is a lovely shirt with wonderful patterns and I do want to consider ordering a size up, if it exists.",2
Crystal Ennis,Nice,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IHEQYYNVWT6G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 21, 2023",Color: Tops Crop RedSize: Large,Verified Purchase,Love the style and make. Size fits nicely but on the next one I order as a precaution I'm going to size up one. Have only worn a couple times since buying and I've already had to fix the stitching for the lace around the belly section so the stitching isn't really that well done.,
Savannah,Super cute but weird material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RZ4JNISTNQ3J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 26, 2023",Color: Tops CropSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"This is really cute and fun to wear, but not for very long. The material is like costume material and it’s not very comfortable to wear all day. It’s also not very stretchy so if you have a bigger bust, it might rip trying to get it on. Mine already has. Otherwise, it’s nice to have for festivals or other short-stay events.",2
Mimi Ortiz,One of my favorite tops!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IR5G0HRIZ38K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 9, 2022",Color: Tops Crop RedSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,Definitely one of my favorite tops! It's a perfect fit for me which was kind of surprising as goth tops are difficult to find for someone plus sized. I was surprised to fit it a little stretchy to the point it actually hugged my curves. Definitely worth buying!,2
Jasper,Gorgeous!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R394FYXD3YP0G1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 3, 2022",Color: Tops Crop RedSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,It's perfect and I was worried it wouldn't look good with my body type (on on the plus size spectrum) and it looks so good and gave me a big confidence boost! Recommend :),3
Kate,cute but staining,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V1XPCVCX0P5H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 5, 2022",Color: Tops CropSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"It’s really cute and looks as advertised; my one complaint is it left a slight stain after all day wear. It came off in the shower, and I didn’t notice the staining on any items, just my skin, but that’s obviously still not ideal. And if you have skin sensitive to dyes this probably isn’t for you.",2
Skylar,"cheap, small",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2462YF9DZLW5P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"2.0 "," the United States "," July 21, 2022",Color: Tops Crop RedSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,you need to have no boobs to fit in it regardless of when size you choose. the lace also started coming off immediately,
Savannah Hurn,Good quality.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18TEBEJ92E9LQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 16, 2022",Color: Tops Crop RedSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"Make sure you size up if you have bigger boobs, I got a black one a while ago and it ripped cause of my boobs",5
Amazon Customer,Sewing isn't the best,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R116PL70DX3TOW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2022",Color: Tops CropSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,It's a very cute top and I don't regret buying it. The only problem is the lace trim isn't sewn on the the best and several stitches have already popped in the 1 time I've worn it. It's not a big deal for me because I'll just sew a new line of stitches around the lace trim.,
Lily Hurd ♥️‼️,Very sexy!! But one sewing issue.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OMUIWFM6ANF5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2021",Color: Tops CropSize: Small,Verified Purchase,I was super excited for the shirt to be something I could wear to school while looking a little older! It was overall a very good shit but at the pace trim on the bottom there was a few holes due to poor sewing. But other than that it’s a quick fix!,
Cxllie,2xl fits like a medium,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LX656MMS12HR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"1.0 "," the United States "," August 20, 2021",Color: Tops Crop RedSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"Sizes are insanely small, if you have a large chest, definitely avoid",9

But other than that it’s really pretty and I will keep wearing it",14
Sabina,I got a small.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1A8FZWAOHCBC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D48TR35T,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 1, 2021",Color: Tops CropSize: Small,Verified Purchase,It’s very cute. Pretty accurate to the picture. It fits right if you get the right size. I would’ve done 4 stars just cause the stitching had two loose threads but mostly the stitching is fine. I overall think it’s a five star product for the price.,7
