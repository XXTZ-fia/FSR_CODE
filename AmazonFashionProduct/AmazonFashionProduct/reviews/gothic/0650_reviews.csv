A. B.,"The perfect ""shopping list"" sized Post-It note.  Colors may vary, so beware.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37S87SK967QFI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BPJVCVZD,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 26, 2023",Color: Wanderlust Pastels,,"In today's world, name-brand products that are worth the price premium are few and far between, but 3M is still the best option available when it comes to adhesives in all their forms.  This product is an updated formula for their classic Post-It Notes:  they advertise 'super sticky' adhesive, and the size is larger, too.This particular product consists of four pads of sticky notes in a 4""x6"" size - about the size most people would use as a shopping list.  These are perfect for a to-do list, perhaps leaving instructions for a babysitter or keeping track of groceries you want to buy on your refrigerator.Each pad is in a different color - you get one of each of the four primary colors in a lighter pastel version.  I like the colors I received, but it's important to note that they aren't the ones that were advertised in the listing.  I definitely received product 4621R-4SSNRP, but I got primary colors instead of a the more springtime pastel arrangement that was advertised.  I actually prefer what I received, but you should be aware the colors might vary if the specifics matter for you.Because these scream 'refrigerator' to me, I do wish they came with a magnet on the back.  I may explore adding one myself, but I'm skeptical of how well they'll hold up in that sort of usage without a slightly thicker backing plate.  It's not a flaw in the product, but I do think it's a missed opportunity.So, are these twice as sticky?  I honestly don't know.  I tried to do some side by side tests with other Post-It notes I had around the house, and they behave... exactly the same.  The adhesive feels just about as sticky to me, and both notes work about as well.  They still don't love sticking to dirty/dusty surfaces, and they still work perfectly on clean, flat ones.  I think these are a great choice, but I'm not sure if I can really confirm the 2x claim:  I'm sure there's a lab test somewhere where these perform that much better, but in real world use they seem pretty equivalent to me.Which isn't a bad thing!  Everyone likes genuine Post-It Notes, and they're a modern classic for a reason.  If you're looking for a larger format that still has the classic Post-It quality, these are exactly what you need.",

I can't tell that they are made of 100% recycled materials as they perform just as well as regular 3M notepads.  You can write with pens and pencils and everything is readable.  Where these pads beat any generic pads is in their sticking power.  These 3M pads will pretty much stick to anything and actually stay there until you manually apply some force to remove them.  It's the type of stick that you want.  You can put them on glossy painted walls, flat matte painted walls, whiteboards, stainless steel refrigerators, wood-finished bookshelves, whatever.  It'll stick and stay there.  And as long as you take it off within a reasonable timeframe (a couple weeks, I think) you shouldn't have any residue left behind.  Definitely 5-stars.",

These notes fix BOTH of those issues, and - coming from Post-It - you know they bring the same ease of use.First, they’re much bigger than the standard note at 4x6 and they’re lined which helps you better use that newfound space to write more on each note and write more clearly/evenly (if you’ve ever tried to read other people’s notes during a meeting, you know how important this can be).  Second, they’ve improved the glue to stick better to walls and other surfaces, yet still remove just as cleanly which is a big win.So these are Post-Its that have been improved in basically every where - and still for a reasonable price.

I prepare food for distributions in plastic bags, close them up, and attach sticky notes that say who they go to.  I started by using traditional Post-it notes but they failed me right away.  The notes would get knocked off through all the handling, or fall off if a bag was jammed into the freezer.  So I also use Scotch Magic Tape.  I didn't think 3M would mind if I used one of their products to help out another.I hadn't heard of 3M super sticky Post-it notes so I thought I would give them a try.  Their adhesive is a little stronger, and I find I don't have to reinforce them with Scotch Tape on plastic bags any more.  I'm not fully satisfied yet because I got the 4"" x 6"" pads of super sticky Post-it notes.  These are too large for me, and dangle off the sides of the plastic bags.  I've been trimming off the bottoms of the notes to make them more compact, but when I next purchase I'll be looking for a smaller size.One brainiac stuck some of the notes I had written (for later attachment to bags) onto a finished wood furniture surface.  I almost had a heart attack, but found if I slowly peeled the super sticky notes off I could do so without causing any damage to the finish.  I read on the packaging that the adhesive used is water based, so I thought if I found I was lifting the finish I would try to dampen the notes from the written side, to get the adhesive to release.  Glad I didn't have to go there.One last detail:  you are reading a Vine review, which means this product was sent to me without my having to pay for it.  I never believed Vine reviews, I felt people would say anything to get free stuff.  The Vine program, at least for me, is a little different:  I only get what I go out of my way to ask for, and everything I get is reported as income to me, so I'll have to pay income taxes at what will probably be reported as list price.  I may actually lose on the deal.  But I wanted to try these super sticky Post-it notes, they actually do work for me where the traditional Post-it notes don't, I didn't know they existed before I saw them available for review, and, hopefully, my experience has been a help to you.",2

Kathy F,Great size; sticks tight but easy to remove,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R7UQNNO6YYPL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BPJVCVZD,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 7, 2023",Color: Wanderlust Pastels,,"This Post-It notepads are great! Just like the regular square Post-Its but the larger size makes them perfect for shopping lists, to-do lists, etc. I appreciate the lines because my handwriting has a tendency to wander and become unruly, and I like the pastel colors because it's easier to read what I've written (unlike on the paper with darker colors).  The adhesive is nice and strong, so I can stick it on my car dashboard where it gets blown around by the AC and doesn't come loose. But when it's time to remove the list, no sticky residue is left behind.  I would definitely buy these again!",
Sue P,Awesome sticky pads!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LWUPVTPA8KZQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BPJVCVZD,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 7, 2023",Color: Oasis,,"I am addicted to post it notes. Have been for years and it is my preferred option when needing to actually write something down to remind, inform, or label items around the house. I use them to temporarily add to a box or items for storing so that I know the contents and since this is the larger 4x6 size, I can organize and itemize everything in the box. Also perfect for writing down something you need when an electronic device isn't available or appropriate. These are also the best for jotting down a quick note to my husband because it shows up well, I can pop it on the front of something I know he'll see (frig, coffee maker, bathroom mirror) and they are bright and eye catching. There is a perfect amount of stickiness and the colors are beautiful! I love that they are recycled paper, as well!",

These stick great you can write on them I even use sharpies and they don’t bleed through. What I like about these post it notes is as with most of them you can remove them and put them in a different location and they still stick.,

I find them to be the perfect size for lists.  The Super Sticky adhesive is much needed given the larger size -- and it holds the paper well.  I always love that I can stick a Post-It note on a vertical surface, inside a book, or write on it while on its pad -- and it never leaves behind a trace.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",
