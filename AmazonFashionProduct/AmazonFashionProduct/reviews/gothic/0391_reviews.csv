Several years ago she surprised me by asking about dressing up for them. I was delighted being an ex theater nerd myself so that was right up my street. Anyways this is the second ren fest dress I've gotten her as she outgrew the first one. She loves the style of this dress it's a bit fairy princess with it's long sleeves and busy bunching and such, and the vibrant red color. The fabric is comfortable (I'm told) even on hotter days. It's reasonably priced and a good value, and will last several years until she outgrows it. It works well and looks good with her other ren fest garb accessories (double ring belt, belt bag, flowered headdress). It does have a bit of a tendency to wrinkle and hold onto wrinkles. Oh well, nothin's perfect I guess.",

It was loose where it needed to be. It was fitted where it needed to be. And it flowed nicely. I especially love the long fabric hanging from the sleves. The fabric wasn't as cheap as I expected. I'm 5'9"" and it was long enough! If I ever have a reason to get this dress again in a different color, I'll definitely get more! It came SUPER compact and wrinkled. There was no time to wash and hang dry (hand wash or gentle cycle only...no instructions on if it needs to hang dry or it is ok to put in the dryer). So, I misted it with water and hung it up overnight. Then fluffed it in the dryer on low heat for 10 minutes before I put it on. The wrinkles came out well enough. Everybody loved it! Idk exactly what you call my ""costume"". But I paired it with a cute crown and necklace. I felt pretty in it and not self conscious about my weight. 10/10 recommend.",2

I used it for a costume party where i dressed as a vampire. I am a bigger girl so i was a bit skeptical of how it would fit. It fit like a glove and hugs in all the right places. I felt so majestic in it. My mom already claimed it for next years costume because she loved the look of it so much. The layering is very well done. I could not believe the value I got it for. I was expecting to pay much more. It did have a vinegary smell to it right out of the package. But that went away when I washed it. I would suggest handwashing it because it slightly ripped under the arm part due to the fabric wrapping around the center part of my washer. It was a small tear that was not visible so I wore it as usual. I am planning to rewear this dress for a Stevie Nick's costume next year. Although it would be nice for a Ren fair if you wanted to.,22

Overall it is about 1 inch longer, and the sleeves are slightly larger which accommodates my larger-than-average arms. Not sure if the difference is consistent between the 2 sellers or if I just got lucky with whichever seamstress made this one, but I'm ecstatic in either case. I purchased this - along with a collar, cape, and a fabulous under-bust corset by Daisy - to be a Victorian vampire, but I can see this dress being on standby for tons of other future costumes.
