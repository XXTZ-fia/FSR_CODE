I normally get a Large, but got an extra large. Definitely should have gone up one more size. I can zip and button the corset, but it's quite tight in the chest, uncomfortable, and limits my movement quite a bit. I realized if I leave it unzipped and only do the buttons, it helps noticeably. The corset also cuts off way up from your belly button, so you either need to wear something beneath it or wear pants/skirt that can be pulled up (unless you're comfortable showing your midriff). Otherwise, it gets the job done if your plan to wear it for a costume. Fabric is nice, buttons are definitely on the cheaper side, so don't strain them, design is great.",

I ordered a XXL and i can zip it fine, although it is tighter it isn't uncomfortable tight. The arms and jacket part of this fits perfectly as a usual XL regardless of the XXL size. I did find that the unique tail coat didn't go in front of my thighs as expected by the model photo, more towards the sides on them. I am altering this slightly to use for a different costume, so that doesn't bother me. It could just have to do with my hip size. Overall I am very happy with the purchase.
