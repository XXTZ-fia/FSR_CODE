It's actually quite nice! The fabric is thick and soft, and the lace on the hem of the dress is silky and hangs nicely. True to size.",
Iggy Fay,Super cute!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZIXSKEPYHRA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49MHHTK,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 29, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Two Piece -Dress+cape,,Adorable and super comfy! Only thing I’d note is that the cover didn’t fit right due to me having broad shoulders. Material isn’t itchy at all.,

Palm,Size Up,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R257RLRGI1N5A7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49MHHTK,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2021",Size: MediumColor: Two Piece -Dress+cape,Verified Purchase,"Ordered a medium based on other reviews and glad I did. I’m 5’3” and 120 lbs. Medium is fitted but not too tight. Soft, faux velvety material. It’s thin and would recommend hand washing. The half jacket was not a medium fit and fits more like a US XS. I cannot button it and it hardly fits on my shoulders. Overall, dress is great, but would skip the jacket based on inaccurate sizing; shame because it’s super cute as well.",3
