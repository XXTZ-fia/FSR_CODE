I held off buying this for awhile because of the price but it is absolutely worth the money. I have never had more people tell me a bag was ""made for me"" until started carrying this around 🤣  It's the perfect bag for your punk/grunge/goth self who feels the need to carry around half their house in their purse LOL.

The material is durable, the color of the bag matches all of my other black clothes for the most part and the strap that comes with it is nice quality too. You can use it as a messenger bag or as a shoulder bag depending on your vibe. I do wish it had better zipper placement but it isn’t the worst. I love all the separate pockets on the outside and inside of the bag since I carry a lot during the day. It’s a bag that’s big enough to carry school supplies, it can be used as a small overnight bag or even a diaper bag. I use it for my work and school materials so it’s always full and I’ve never had an issue with anything breaking off or becoming worn too fast. Definitely worth the money!",13

Id lean towards marketing it as a backpack/duffel bag and lowering the price because of the cheapness in materials because it's honestly not worth the price.,

It has a lot of space and plenty pockets, as well as smaller pockets for pens and such. The only way I can think to describe the space inside is that it could hold two or three textbooks to be  completely full. Even then, you’d still have some space to keep little things like your wallet and make-up from the crazy amount of pockets this thing has. It’s good for travel, fits well beneath an airplane seat. Has three straps, two to make it a shoulder bag and one long one for a crossbody bag.",

I have gotten multiple compliments on this purse and all just within the first few days of using it. It does come with an extra long strap and that is a bonus as well.

I have not been disappointed by any of them. This bag in particular looks just like the pictures and is so adorable in person. One thing that I don't feel gets translated with the pictures is just how big this purse is. It almost feels like the size of a diaper bag and not a purse. And there are pockets for days so if you like pockets this is definitely the bag for you. There are some drawbacks to this particular purse in general however. The zippers are very hard to manipulate and the extra decorations on the purse don't stay on well. Aside from that though everything is awesome on the bag and I am thoroughly happy with my purchase. I will most definitely end up with more lost Queen purses in my collection. They last a long time and are durable, I just am excessively hard on my bags and like switching up my style.

So I pondered whether to keep it or give it back. I didn’t want to give it up because it’s such a unique bag it’s just really cute and different… But it just wasn’t worth keeping a bag that isn’t working correctly that you pay $60 for of your hard earned money and it doesn’t do what it should do. It might just have been a fluke and I got a bad bag. I am going to try and order it again in a different color and see how that goes but the one I ordered in black I had to return. But know that it is much bigger than it looks so if you’re a tiny person like myself it’s an overwhelming bag because it has so much going on it’s a lot of bag for a little person… Lol.

This one has been pretty much my daily since I got it in 2022. Occasionally I switch it out but I'm general it has been in constant use since I got it and it is still going strong. It's been washed, kicked when I've sat it on the floor, knocked around when the kids throw their backpacks on it, I don't abuse it, but it takes some rough handling. And I still get tons of compliments on it.  None of the stitching has come loose. The handles are still holding strong. No tears, no signs of wear.  The charms on the zippers did disappear quite quickly, and after taking the ""belt"" part off to wash it, it never went back on correctly.  However, only one of the side pocket zippers has gotten messed up and pulled apart. The rest are fine. I don't use those pockets though, so that might explain why.  Over all, it's still a great purse. I use it more often than not, so I can attest to it being sturdy. Unless you're really battering it and carrying around really heavy stuff (I mean really heavy), it's going to last.  Original review: First, I get a ton of compliments on it. And it's so perfectly goth. It's hard to find a large bag that's still gothy.  Warning though, because of the construction, it's a heavy bag without anything in it (which I don't mind at all. I'm used to carrying heavy things).  The color is beautiful, the hardware is great, and the materials are sturdy. It is not a flimsy faux leather, it's thick cotton for the body, and the straps are very sturdy.  Other reviewers had issues with the zippers. I pulled the zippers open, not with the pull, but just opened them, and every zipper has zipped perfectly. Now, granted some are hard to reach, but I figured that by looking at the pictures.  It's roomy. Very, very, roomy. Lose a small child in there roomy. However, I use a purse organizer (best invention ever) so I never have to dig through the purse for my keys or wallet. It's the perfect size for my organizer AND has extra room so I can have the shoulder strap in there (just in case I want to carry it that way) and carry a couple small cotton shopping bags.  I think that it will be a bag that lasts. The materials are high quality and the construction is sturdy. For the price, you are getting a large, quality bag. They could charge more for it and it would still be worth it! (Don't though! I want the red stripe and the back and white stripe too.. at the current price!)",
