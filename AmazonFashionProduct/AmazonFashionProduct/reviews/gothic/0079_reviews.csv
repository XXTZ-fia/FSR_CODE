Leslie Johnson,"Gothic, Cute and Warm",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPUUAOCJ131M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD3GQQW3,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 28, 2024",Color: 03.red/Crow,,"I live in Minnesota and it gets cold here, so I wear a lot of beanies. I like MOSTLY plain ones, so they can go with many outfits but you need some fun details every now and then and I'm a bit dark and moody, so the skull and raven combo caught my eye. The vibrant red is gorgeous, the applique applied nicely with no snags or lifting corners. The hat is soft and warm and fits great and I'm excited for snow so I can wear it without getting too hot lol.",
Rayne Alexandria,Good for Fall Season,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NYE7F8LHPLQ6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD3GQQW3,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 24, 2024",Color: 03.black/Skull,,"This beanie is made from a fairly light/thin material that is perfect for the fall season. I was pleased with it's snug fit, but it is a bit long. I had to roll the back of the beanie up about one and a half times in the back. Anyway, it's comfortable, it fits snuggly enough to help keep warmth in, without burning you up once it's actually on your head.  It's a pretty sweet beanie and the design on the front looks like it's an iron-on patch that's been sewn on? It's well-done, whether man or machine made, it's quality work. I would say this beanie could definitely last several seasons of continuous wear. Cute beanie! One of my new favs!",
Adrian,"Adorable, thick & strechy.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RI4D7YA8LRXP4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD3GQQW3,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 21, 2024",Color: 01.black/Skeleton,,The quality of this is super cute something id definitely buy if I seen it at hot topic. Stretchy and not oddly too long where it looks dumb on your head. I love this beanie it's super warm and cute!,
Marcus Darpino,Nice hat. I wish it hasn't vacuum packed into oblivion.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MLEW3NXCW9V5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD3GQQW3,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 13, 2024",Color: 03.black/Skull-l,,There shouldn't be a process required to make the hat useable. It came so smashed that the creases were nearly permanent. I had to wet the hat and run it through the dryer to get it near wearable. I massaged it the rest of the way.  I like the hat very much. I just wish it shipped better.,
Adam Kuykendall,Fun for my kids!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NJNNSFWPWBMW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD3GQQW3,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 9, 2024",Color: 03.white/Skull-r,,"Great hat just in time for Halloween!  Made from a comfortable fabric and stylishly designed, my kid loves it and will put it to good use. It can be hard to get your kids to dress warm in the colder months and this has ensured they might get sick one less time by where this when it's cold season.",

Jennifer Jones,Incredibly soft,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCBATS4HIM7CT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD3GQQW3,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 3, 2024",Color: 01.black/Skeleton,,This hat is incredibly soft and fits so well.

Shlebby,Good beanie but not thick,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22NOOTBTA7QTB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD3GQQW3,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 1, 2024",Color: 03.red/Crow,,"This is a pretty nice beanie. It’s not very thick which is nice so it’s not too hot, but aesthetically I prefer the look of a thicker beanie. It’s not itchy but it is on the tighter side. It fit snug and my head is an average size, so it may be too tight for people with sensitivities or who have a larger head. The design was sew cleanly, looked good and doesn’t deform while wearing. While I like the beanie, I think saying it’s “thick” is not accurate and it’s a bit too tight to be comfortable for long-wear. The color is also accurate and is a vibrant red. It’s definitely on the long side as well so keep that in mind. I would still recommend it and I’d give it a 4.3.",
Bob,Great Beanie! 😊,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RE731WHL22C52/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DD3GQQW3,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2024",Color: 01.black/Skeleton,,"I’m impressed by the quality of this beanie! It feels very soft, the embroidery is perfect, it has a good amount of stretch to it, and it is thick and warm enough without being too much. I can’t wait to wear it this fall and winter season! Definitely recommend for beanie-lovers.",
