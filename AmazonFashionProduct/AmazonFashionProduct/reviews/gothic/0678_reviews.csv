This has laces on the sides like mini corsets. This has fit a small child all the way up to a plus sized woman and it always looked fairly flawess. The fabric is a little less luxe up close, but from a distance no one would ever know.",

The dress did not come in time but I tried it on today and the dress is beautiful, fits wonderful and is great quality. Paired with a petticoat it will be perfect for next year. Could even pair it with a black veil for a general scary Victorian look.",

Arielle,Great Qaulity,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AGIZY60J1K17/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN96PRN5,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 2, 2024",Size: 3X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,It is not true to size. I sized up just to be roomier and it fits like normal - so it runs a tad small. It is great quality though. There is ribbon on the sides to cinch in the waist which I thought was a nice add on - though it could probably snap if cinched too much. All in all - a great find.,

The dress is comfortable for this purpose and very soft. The size fit perfectly. I completely love that it is full length (it is so sad that nowadays that type of real full length is so hard to find!). I hope to purchase more, I hope to find more diversity from this seller in the future because I would be a returning customer and I believe many of my friends would purchase as they cherish this style as well. Thank you!",4
