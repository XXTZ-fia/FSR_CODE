Jennifer B.,Cheap,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYNEAM5HSXHZP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP2H1PRD,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 7, 2023",Color: WhiteSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"The material was a very shiny polyester, non-breathable material.

C. Adams,Love the style,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA8AAJ4JXTY0R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP2H1PRD,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 21, 2023",Color: ApricotSize: X-Large,,"This is a wonderful vintage, Victorian look. It's a little big on me, but I don't even care (I ordered up because my size wasn't available). Because of the fit I'll probably wear it out (not tucked in) and use it as a tunic of sorts.",
Christi B.,Nice but small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29PCAK3RVMHE6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP2H1PRD,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 6, 2023",Color: ApricotSize: XX-Large,,It's a small running size so id say definitely size up since you can cinch it in the back easily with the corset. It's just a tad too small for me so I may have to do some alterations - but it is still a good quality blouse and gives a great antique feel.,
Terrance Robinson,The sleeves are a plus!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16CDS0GLEGPFI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP2H1PRD,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 22, 2023",Color: BlackSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,This blouse is gorgeous. The sleeves were an eye catcher. The tie in the back can be adjusted to the tightness or the looseness that you like!!,
