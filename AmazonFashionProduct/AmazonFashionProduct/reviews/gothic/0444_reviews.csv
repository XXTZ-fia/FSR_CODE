Kat,"Very nice, inexpensive jewelry",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BQKRX3GQTAO3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6FKGLLZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"Good quality jewelry with cute little designs as pictured. These are small in size but true to gauge so as thick as you’d expect but be ready for a small circumference and beads. The black on them does not seem to tarnish or fade. Easy enough to use because you can get a grip on the designed pieces to hold on and screw them in, but they are small. Durable and don’t bend or break in use.",

Courtney,"Hard to click, some won't even unscrew, some are heavy",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AAQJL5HIBMN2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6FKGLLZ,"3.0 "," the United States "," February 24, 2024",Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"So the products are about as good as metal as they get I guess. A few things wrong though.  1. The skull clicker is very hard to get open and then clicked close once in your nose. 2. The purple ""crystal ball"" is very heavy, wasn't expecting that. 3. The cat and moon nose ring would not unscrew, i tried so hard to unscrew it that the moon broke off. 4. The bumble bee nose rings threading is loose.  I wish I could give the product a better review, but I can't. I bought this pack specifically for the bumble bee, cat and moon, and bat rings. I can wear 1 of them all the time, I can wear the other sometimes because it is loose. And the third one I can't wear because it broke when trying to unscrew it.",

Whitney Cooper,Please do not waste your money,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14S3TW2BTK7X8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6FKGLLZ,"1.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2023",Color: Black,Verified Purchase,The clickers in the pack do not stay locked in. The jewelry with the balls are impossible because they’re so tiny. Not one single piece of this is able to be used long term with ease. This isn’t the first pack of septum piercings I’ve purchased from Amazon but it is the worst by far!,

keith,Wat too small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R159C2QOOHE22Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6FKGLLZ,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 14, 2023",Color: Black,Verified Purchase,The top of the bat kept poking my nose making it run. The skull wouldn't even close without pulling on my nose. The cat and moon one the tip of the moon was hooked on to the inside of my nose making it also unable to wear. Really can't use any of the cute clickers. Not worth buying all of them if you can only really use one or two.,
