M. Becker,Beautiful fabric,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PLR1HMN99DHO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFRCHTX8,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 13, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,,We are frequent attendees at renfests and needed to replace some worn out costume pieces. These were chosen for pirate and steampunk outfits and the quality was beyond what I expected. The fabric is a good weight and overall a nicely tailored piece. It’s on par with costume pieces we see from vendors at the faires for three times the price.,

Fabrics are wonderful for pants usually intended for costuming, embossed patterns in the fabric are very attractive-looking. Finishing is perfectly done, wonderful for everything from RenFair to caroling.",
