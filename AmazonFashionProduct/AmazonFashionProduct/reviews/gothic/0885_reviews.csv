Buffy,The material is heavier And it wears better than the other companies I tried,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KII1M8F6ZJL6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWJ3QQ69,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 17, 2024",Color: RedSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,I love the product I like the style it’s comfortable. Just sorry it took me three coats to get the perfect one…. Thank you for being so patient Alan enjoyed the coat immensely and thank you for your patience too on deliveries but this is the best made out of the rest of the companies. I think thanks again happy holidays.☝️,
asterismW,Great quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27JELXIZJ7GIJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWJ3QQ69,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 13, 2024",Color: BlueSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I bought this for a cosplay costume. I was really impressed with the quality. Quality fabric, well stitched, and finished edges. I didn't like the puffy sleeves, so I got them tailored to be regular sleeves, but the rest of it I left alone. Good fit (I'm 5'6"", 150 lbs and I got the medium, after finding the large was too big), very comfortable. I was very happy with it!",

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the bust area being on the smaller side. I do like, that it could be used next year for a different type of character.",

Jacquelinesoleil,Looks ok but definitely not 1 day shipping,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3765R2CJNNHF9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWJ3QQ69,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 18, 2024",,Verified Purchase,I bought the large as recommended and it was too big so I ordered another one in medium for Prime 1 day shipping. It’s been 5 days and I still don’t have it. For a Halloween party that is tomorrow so I’m not confident I’ll get it in time.,
bobble,Order up.. don't have high expectations,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ8UI34N2RVQE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWJ3QQ69,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 27, 2024",Color: Black-111Size: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"Fabric has no stretch, it's a cheap polyester. Cut is ok, but because it has zero stretch it's going to be hard to get the right fit unless you have a Barbie body. Definitely not worth the money. Bought for a Halloween event.. contemplating if I have enough time to send this back or not. Really disappointed.",
Jessi,Disproportionate,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AL0BVHE7ENUW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWJ3QQ69,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Well, I ordered this for kind of a niche purpose, halloween related. Im normally an xs but becauae so many reviews complained about it running small, I thought I could fit a small. No, this thing runs big if youre a small person. Im 5'1 and 110 lbs and it was really long, almost hitting the floor in the back, and way too loose in the skirt. It looked weird and not really like the picture; the poofy shoulder frill was a lot bigger than the picture and the pockets were on the side of the coat instead of in the front. The bust area fit just fine (Im a 32b) so the whole thing was disproportionate. The sleeves are long and it just wasnt really flattering. It being priced at above $50 makes no sense, considering the material is an odd cotton (maybe poly blend?). Just overall not really something Id wear as a costume, much less day to day use. I will say, the color was accurate.",2

Pats2cents YouTube,I took a chance. Fit is snug around shoulders. Material is similar to graduation robe fabric.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NMYEYF1AR305/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWJ3QQ69,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2024",Color: Black-111Size: 3X-Large,Verified Purchase,"Pictures will follow soon. Flattering only of you are a large woman with a waist line and a flatter tummy. This is not to be worn too tight. Snug is fine; but please avoid wearing if too small. The flattering effects will only work against you and make you look worse. Since I battle with fluid retention. I know that 7-10lb loss will make this a perfect fit; so I took a chance. It is snug now; but when I get my ankles down to normal (in a day or 2) I will take some pictures to show how it fits. I don't wear clothes too tight; because that makes ""heavy"" look FAT.",10
Summer Rose,Cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNY661MHRB56O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWJ3QQ69,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2024",Color: Black-111Size: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"I feel that it is necessary to first mention I carry my weight mostly in the front, and have an extra large chest, so my issues with the fit of this jacket are only due to my body, not the jacket itself. This fits perfectly across my back, shoulders, through my arms, and the length is perfect. It has a nice shape in the waist, but due to the way I carry my weight, I can't even button it half way from the bottom up, and there is zero chance of the fabric so much as touching across my chest...but that is not a quality issue, that is a me issue. Even though I can't button it, the way the collar on both sides naturally folds down looks really cute, which is nice, I didn't expect it to, figured it would look weird. So I can still wear this without feeling like I look silly. Oh and I didn't notice this in the description so may have missed it, but it has pockets! As a jacket this should not have surprised me, but it did, in a good way.",19
asc,Nice item but . . .,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34A2W9OM8BXJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWJ3QQ69,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 25, 2023",Color: Black-111Size: 3X-Large,,"This is a cute item, but when I got mine there were 2 buttons already off in the package and another one fell off when I tried it on. (It was on the sleeve) While checking the rest I noticed all of the button stitching was really loose so I now have to re-sow all of the buttons to be able to wear it.  I can’t find a way to contact the seller directly and don’t want to return it but it was still disappointing.",6
