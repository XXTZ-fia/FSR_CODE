Stainless Steel just needs some soap and water and it shines! This is super heavy and solid, just a fantastic quality piece of jewelry! Sometimes these bigger rings fit kinda different on the same finger but opposite hands. It’s kinda big on my right pointer but fits perfect on my left pointer. It’s the finger and ring shape, design etc. It’s not a sizing issue from the company. Just play around with it and you’ll find your fit.  10/10",

I ordered what I thought would fit my middle finger measured multiple times for future reference. It fits my pinky. It's a wonderful ring is beautiful I love it. It's definitely size up. Don't know why it's going by centimeters here but it's much smaller than what it says it is on the sizing chart. That being said I love it I would order it again of course I was size up order it for a friend. But when in doubt size up it comes with little wraps to help make it smaller so if it's too big you're safe but too small we're stuck with pinky ring.,
