melanie jex,Very cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BHT723WIGGZW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHXZYJZS,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 5, 2024",Color: BlackSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,I loved it,
C. Dailey,Nice jacket but has zipper in front,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9HTHGIKOHTB5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHXZYJZS,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 1, 2024",Color: RedSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"The product title is ""Medieval Renaissance Gothic Frock Coat Steampunk Victorian Jacket"". Unfortunately zippers, like the one going all the way up the front of this coat, are not very medieval. It's very difficult to see in the photos but the zipper really takes away from the look and modernizes something that is potentially very vintage. Ultimately I returned this item.",

Krazy Munky,Runs a bit large,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MTU42XJ1G67X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHXZYJZS,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 21, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Normally I have to size up. Especially because of my arms. Oddly I had to size down so instead of a large or xl I ended up with a medium. I still have room, but it’s comfortable, and the arms fit well, it’s a little costumy for my normal costume, but this year we will be outside , so I need a coat, the price was right on this one.",4

Mamissa,Not worth the headache,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SCVJGBGZ1XP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHXZYJZS,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 5, 2023",,Verified Purchase,Runs super large. Isn’t the best quality. It has a ton of stretch. I opt for a large when I want to be comfy and didn’t get to use this at all-I ordered a medium to replace the large and it was too big. Had to return both,8
