Steampunk vibe/pirate vibe. I got XL size and it fit just right (5""10, 215 pounds). Like the color and fit with my Dark Plaque Doctor Vibe.  Cons: The hood on it seemed to small, close to the my head, giving me a world war I vibe with my raven mask (the black hood in my pictures is another one I strapped on top, which also help hide the black military like stripes on the shoulders).  I think the coat is better when you have an idea of what you want to mix with it. I was wearing a black body suit underneath and platform boot (as well as other accessories). So I think it's great when you know what to want to use with, but by itself it could look incomplete.  Otherwise, help me make one of my favorite Ren Fair/Halloween costumes.",

I ordered a size larger than normal. Wish I’d gone 2. The sleeves are tight as with most Chinese clothes. The zipper at the hips goes all the way around the body. Not sure I like the looks of the zipper in the back. The fabric is a slightly stretchy polyester, it looks good. The trim on the shoulders doesn’t exactly match the image and is not fully sewed down. I think over all this coat will be good. It’s a statement piece to add to the kid’s wardrobe so he looks cool. My only real beef with it is there are no care instructions. It got wet with some smelly liquid and I don’t know how to get it clean. Being polyester it should be washable. But the faux leather trim concerns me.  Ok so it’s a few days later. I did wash this in a front load washer on delicate, cold, with a slow spin and hung to dry. It worked really well and dried quicker than expected. The wrinkles remained. Overall I was impressed. However, just now the zipper that holds the tails to the coat and goes around the hips, just separated leaving a gap between the tails and the jacket. I should be able to fix it with a little work, but it’s not happening. I’ll try again in a few. But I like the coat enough I’ll get a replacement rather than a refund.",

AnubianArmani,"A bit of a sizing nightmare even with the guide! Thin, baggy in areas and dissapointed..",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HKZUTPGUB9ON/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08N694F1D,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 1, 2021",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Right.  So, this one was a bit of a trap for me because I love the look of this in the photo. When I expected a cool looking double breasted coat sadly, this was a thin confusingly buttoned mess. I cannot really tell where to fasten it because it always appears off line, the hood just looks a bit ""off"" like it was just plopped there and I am confused on the correct way that ""neck flap"" sits.  The fit was very baggy in the sleeves and bunches up underneath the zipper (if buttoning it on the far left because otherwise it boxes you out like a plank with no form fitting and it is comparable to party store costume wear in the thinness and how the cheapest zipper type/ hardware was used to build it up. I wanted to like it more, but I was disappointed. I suppose I should have expected as much here as some would tell me but I usually do not buy things like this here. I much rather be up front about how it really is and not just ""let it go because that is how it is"". There is some quality things here. It is a LINT MAGNET! Walk outside for a bit and stuff sticks like glue. The belting/straps are flimsy with the cheapest faux buckles that I can see on a cheap one off party costume.  The Takeaway: If you are looking for a cheap outfit and you can tailor it for yourself to wear at a party or part of a quick OC cosplay. Sure! That is why I did not rate it as low as I wanted. It can be made to look good with work. As is, it's just an awkward gaggle of fabric, zippers and snap fasteners.  Pics soon!",
