Bee Bee,Ok quality. But I have my worries,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R66LI8PLNP7YN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQRHXB8H,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Wjc663_coffee/Ash_brown,Verified Purchase,"First issue I had immediately because it was shipped directly in the clear thin garment bag and there was multiple rips and scuffs, so my delivered item also had damages. Zero privacy and protection.  Second issue I take is that this is not at all the quality you'd expect for the price. The zippers are horrible, as many other reviews state. The sizing is off an incredible amount. I normally wear a large for fitted looks, id buy XL for some room. I am a 32G so I normally do size up for chest room. I thought am XL would work, but after reading the reviews I opted for XXL. The XXL size fits exactly like a large would. Thankfully it is pretty much how I wanted it to fit so I guess that was worth it?  But, it arrived with damages, and was shipped inappropriately imo which caused that. And then left out on my porch where anyone could see exactly what I ordered (including thieves) and in the weather with large holes in the thin packaging. All around the entire experience was something I expect from a $15 item.  The one thing I would give credit for is that it at least does seem like it will be warm for what I needed it for. But for the price I paid that's literally the least it could do. This isn't worth the price.",

It fit snugged around the arms and torso. It fits big on the shoulders and the length of the sleeves.  I have long arms and the jacket sleeve was still long on me.

Someone's dog hair was all over it.  It's got two zip-up options. You can zip the inner removable layer or the outer ""leather"" layer. I find that it gets a little tight under the arms when I zip the outer layer, and it mashes the boobage a bit. So I wear it with the inner layer zipped up, and the outer layer half-zipped.

I even upped the size based on other reviews from my go-to large to a mind blowing XXL which will literally be the largest sized anything I’ve ever bought for myself. The material seems nice and I really like the zipped in hoodie for removal for washing. My biggest gripe is how it was shipped. While I’m all for foregoing the excessive packaging when possible, shipping a leather-like item with no exterior packaging is a gamble I wouldn’t take. I was lucky enough not to receive a scuffed or damaged jacket, but it definitely needs to be shipped inside a bubble envelope at the very least.",6
