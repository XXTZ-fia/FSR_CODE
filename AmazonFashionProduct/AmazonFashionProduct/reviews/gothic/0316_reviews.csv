She had it on her list and I was a bit skeptical due to the 'mini' skirt taut. It was short but long enough to meet my concerns (as a grandma). The material is quite good. Thick but not too thick. Enough to make the skirt stand out and not just hang down. It went with a myriad of the tshirts she got and even a nice blouse she got. Very good item. In fact I will probably look for more in different colors.,

I bought this as a Christmas gift for my teenager. I ordered a medium and they sent a small. The package says “M”, while the skirt clearly shows “S”. It is so small it would barely fit my 9yo. The material is also definitely not cotton. It feels like thin felt that you can put your finger through. It’s so thin that it’s see-through! I cannot believe how much they charge for this. Between the very poor quality, wrong product being sent and wonky sizing, stay away!",

Despite this, what arrived could barely pass for a small! The length was super short, and it was impossible to wear comfortably. To make matters worse, the fabric was thin and felt very cheap. It’s overpriced and not worth it at all. Even if the sizing wasn’t an issue, the material alone makes it not worth the price tag.

Otherwise it is super cute and great for warm weather.  4-stars mostly cuz the zipper seems finicky,

Temperance Helman,Favorite skirt I've ever bought,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R256THCEJBTRK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D41DXYM9,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 27, 2024",Size: 4XColor: A Pure Black,Verified Purchase,"I plan on buying another one of these skirt's in a different color because I love the style and fit so much. It is extremely flattering, and as a plus sized and pear shaped person I find it hard to find things that don't feel snug in the wrong places. The skirt has a slick material that makes it easy to clean, but a bit scratchy to wear directly against the skin. Its a lightweight material so it doesn't make me hot to wear layers with it, and the material is thick enough to not be see through. I spent my second time ever wearing it to a 7 hour long concert, as well as walked 3-4 miles in it the same day and it didn't make me too hot to keep wearing it, but I could tell that if I didn't have a shirt tucked into it that the material would have hurt my skin during that time. The corset part works nicely, and there is some extra elastic to give extra stretch and comfort around the waist with or without tightening the ribbons. I suggest completely removing the ribbon when machine washing it, because it will come undone and tangle up with other clothes. I can get into the skirt easily without having to use the zipper (I'm a B cup), but if you have large breasts and would need to unzip do so with caution! The zipper seems fragile and if tugged too harshly I can see it breaking.",8

It's so flattering and the perfect fabric weight, flowing so pretty! I especially love the ribbon-corset front. Snatches the waist so perfectly. It's so comfy, too. Bought it in the pink plaid as seen in the video and plain black. May come back to buy more variants!  My only complaints are how tough it is to get the zipper to move, making it feel as though I may break it if I try too hard, and hoping the quality of the product lasts. I can never be too sure. I've only worn it once so far, but you never know.  Overall, definitely think it's worth it, especially if you have a cute outfit in mind!",12

The material is very light and thin, not see through but thinner than I expected. Also because it is so thin it doesn't have enough stiffness to flare out like in the picture. It falls more straight down than flaring out. It doesn't have any stretch but I would go with the size you normally wear. After reading comments about the lack of stretch I went for a larger size when I would normally go for the medium. I sit between sizes normally. The skirt is too big and I am gonna need to alter it now. Also if you have short legs this skirt will be just a few inches off of your knee. The front is just decorative so if you wanted it to cinch it won't hold up well. Otherwise it is nice. The color was spot on and I don't see any issues in the construction.",4

Overall pretty good value for the money. The lace up part looks a bit cheap but otherwise it’s really cute.,2
