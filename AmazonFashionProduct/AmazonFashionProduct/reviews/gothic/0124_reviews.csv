I wish that I had tried it on as soon as I got it rather than waiting until Halloween. Also it runs quite small. Ordered a 4x (Not a US 4x) thinking I'd have some wiggle room ( I am a 2x) because the sizes aren't accurate sizes. Should have ordered up another size for it not to be snug.",

It was a little big on me and I could have ordered the 3X but I wanted to make sure it fit. The mesh material is a little itchy but nothing too crazy. And I will say be careful when washing this dress. The flowers were sewn on and I don't want them to unravel or rip off. I hang dry my dress and washed on delicate setting. The only detail I don't like about this dress is it doesn't have pockets. Other than that such a beautiful and well made dress.",21

The sheer fabric feels very delicate- must take care putting on and do not recommend a snug fit or it will tear.  The small fits more like a size 2 or 3 than a size 4, and is short waisted.  If you are busty, this may not work for you.  Had to return as the zipper would not work- it got stuck in the waist band and wouldn’t go all the way up.  Black fabric has a bit of stretch which is nice!  Returned the small and ordered a medium- it literally fits the exact same way with maybe only a 1/4 inch more room around the waist.  It is not longer in the waist at all, and the zipper still sticks in the waistband area, but I was at least able to get it up all the way.",

When I say it so disappointing its not funny. the material is scratchy and see through the dress not the sleeves. It felt like something you'd buy at forever 21 in 2010. A large was more like a medium and even then the sleeves had the super cheap ribbons sewn on so tight it started to suffocate my arms. Biggest disappointment. Will be returning.,
