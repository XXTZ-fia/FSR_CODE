C. W.,Nice necklace,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ONHG7SQ2BADN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNSTM8F1,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Style: Layered Beads Heart,,"This necklace is just as pictured. It seems pretty durable, and I like the two lengths of the chains. An odd thing is that the clasp is on the left side. If this bothers you, it looks like it would be pretty easy to detatch the main charm, turn it around, and put it back on.",
