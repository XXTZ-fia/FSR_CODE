She loves it. The lacing at the waist snugs it up beautifully. Alternately, she has since worn this several times to other events with a corset. It looks cute either way. Laundering is a breeze. My only concession is I do put it in a laundry bag to prevent the lace from snags. For how inexpensive this dress is, I honestly wasn't expecting much. But it's comfortable, looks good, and is easy to care for.",

The deep purple color is beautiful.  Unfortunately, the cups are sown in and the adjustable shoulder straps do not have a large range. For reference I am 5' 5"" at 140lbs, I wear a size 34DD. My chest fits and is covered properly, but the cups sit awkwardly. It doesn't look awkward, but it feels just off enough that I constantly feel the need to adjust.  Overall I do really like it.",4
