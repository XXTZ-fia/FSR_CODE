Natasha,Cheap Heap of fabric,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R386ZN74OVD9T6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP96FR51,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"I was so excited for this product until I unwrapped it. It looked like it might have been previously returned as it arrived in a boutique zip locked baggy but it was bunched up instead of folded.  The material is a shiny sleek elastic breathable fabric like any generic $20 witch costume but it is Heavy with all the layers. I think the unflattering figure is due to the material used but more so due to the shorter bodice length and the fact that the layers are sewned at the underbust instead of at the hips. The fit is ok. I went down a size and probably could have squeezed another one down if the lossen material around my underbust and arms are to go by but the seams were protesting when I attempted to pull it over my head more from how heavy it is. There is a zipper under the armpit, I think it's meant to allow the size out more? But it was unnecessary in my case. I'm not happy with the price I paid for the product received.",

Carmela,Costume,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CMTDBW793HSO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP96FR51,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 26, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Z2882gn,,"Looks surprisingly true to the picture. It's a thicker costume material. It is a bit loose fitting. Great for a colder outing or layering underneath. The arms look a bit weird, it would be better with gauntlets or another accessory. This piece is adaptable for a variety of uses.",
MeganElaine,Too heavy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9Z91FLV3UNZQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP96FR51,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 17, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Z2882,Verified Purchase,"Yes the material has stretch, but too much, the heavy weight with all the fabric weighed it down and it was unflattering.",

I thought I could make it look good, but it was not particularly interesting to look at. First year I didn't receive a single compliment on my costume.",
LeeR,SO CUTE!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O9OPX4QITW5C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP96FR51,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 30, 2024",,,I ordered a small I’m 5’7 ish and 133lbs. It could be tighter around the waist but other than that it’s perfect! It worked awesome for my ghostface costume!,
Jamie,Good quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R306V2LLPW0JN2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP96FR51,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 29, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Z2882gn,Verified Purchase,I was surprised with the texture and thickness. It's multi layered which made it pretty warm. I got an XL which is what I normally wear and it fit loosely. A large could have worked but I'm glad I played it safe because it still fits nicely and feels great!,
Cheryl J Stocks,Nice costume,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSSKMTF17NEW5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP96FR51,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 12, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Z2882gn,Verified Purchase,I bought this for the Renaissance Fair. I added things to it to be a huntress/elf. Very comfortable and received compliments.,
Melissa,Cool costume!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GT7IMP8SGTRR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP96FR51,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 1, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Z2882gn,,"This is a cool versatile costume! The material is thick and durable. I love the asymmetrical look and it actually lays just as pictured when worn, so I was pretty happy with that! True to size, it fits great- very comfy with lots of stretch! My husband said I looked like Robin Hood or an elven archer. Looks nice with a simple waist corset or just as is. Very functional for a variety of costume aspirations!",4
A. Goebel,Neat but tight,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM6ZEZLMI9JXG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP96FR51,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2024",Size: 3X-LargeColor: Z2882,,"This hoodie dress is really neat. I like all the layers and how they lay, and details like the buttons on the sleeves. However, it just too tight for me. I was able to get it on because it has a zipper under one arm, but I couldn't close the zipper. If you larger in the chest, either size up by at least two sizes (I sized up by one size), or pass on this.",5
Misha Lawing,Cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IIJBOSNXSN9U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP96FR51,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 27, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Z2882,,it is cute and comfy but the little hems here and there tear easily if you stretch it at all.,
JoJo Moser,So cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RADO13MP1Y1DU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP96FR51,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 16, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Z2882gn,,I love this dress. It really gives off elf vibes and I am here for it. The only thing I wish is that I had ordered one size smaller as it is a little bit roomier for me than I would like but honestly it isn’t noticeable to anyone but me. I just add a lovely brown braided belt and it levels the outfit up another notch which synching the waist in more.  I also tuck the stings of the hoodie portion away so you cant see them. I really like the forest green color and the fabric is pretty soft and cozy! I would absolutely get this again.,2
Tammy W.,Nice,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14B9WLHWZ62HT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP96FR51,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 15, 2024",,,"Made well.  No chemical smells.  Comfortable.  It's a bit big on me, but I'm on the petite side so it was kinda expected. The sizing issue will allow me to layer something underneath for warmth when I wear it for Halloween.  Can't wait.",
RogerPasadena,"Pics are Accurate, Good Details",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA7GXLJWOAEV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP96FR51,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 8, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Z2882vt,,"The first thing to know about this costume piece is it is not extremely high quality fabric. That sort of stretchy silky Man made(in whole or part) Material that inexpensive costumes are made of these days. Some of the pieces seem to be blistered with dense foam inserts.  The second thing to know is that the details are very nicely done, and once it is recovered from being squished in a bag and shipped, looks quite nice. The size has run fairly true to their billing so if you like a looser fit order a bigger size. (The large size fit well on a curvy person, but did not accommodate a very full bust well.)  The purple is a good deep solid color, but as it has not been washed one does not know how well that color will hold.",8
