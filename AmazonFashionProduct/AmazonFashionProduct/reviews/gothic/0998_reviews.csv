I have a big chest and a larger stomach as well, and this is somewhat flattering but it does not work perfectly with my big chest.  The other thing about this is the fabric sensation is horrific. The red color is that stretch legging fabric and not made of cloth and then the lace sleeves have a harsh hemm. If it wasn't so cute i'd give it a two. BUt it is cute enough that I'd be willing to alter it, but please for the love of Christmas do not get this shirt thinking you're going to have that nostalgic emo feeling fromt he 90s.

It's unique looking and sexy, but it's conservative enough to wear casually.  The fabric was surprisingly soft for being flannel. I was expecting it to be rougher then it ended up being. The lace was as soft and comfortable as expected. Both fabrics have a satisfying feel to them, I don't feel like I'm wearing a cheap garment.  The chest area is shaped for breasts, enhancing that feminine figure. I felt really sexy just because of that detail.  I love the ribbon and grommet details, but the ribbon is so smooth that it kept untying itself, I had to retry both sides multiple times throughout the day. The other issue I had was that the ribbon kept pulling up the bottom of this shirt. I'm tempted to rethread the ribbons to avoid the lower grommets. Additionally, the ribbons are long, those will probably get trimmed too, once I fully thread them through all the grommets.  Overall I am very happy with this top and easily recommend it!",

Luckily, I ordered it mostly for home, so that's not a dealbreaker for me, although I could stand to lose some weight to make it a bit more flattering. It hangs at the body a little bit, in random places, I believe because of the material in combination with my being a bigger size person to begin with (5'5"", ~199, ordered 3XL). The sizing was at least not too small. The cut is beautiful, I really love the shoulder area and the arms and the way that entire top half is structured. If they made this out of cotton, or any other more actual-dayware-material, I could 100% recommend it, but as it stands, I can only recommend it for pajama-esque or similar use cases.",

It's also quite flattering! The lace on the sleeves is stretchy and soft. I was worried it might be a little itchy the way a stiff lace can be, but it's not at all. The lace ""band"" is only in the front, it does not go all the way around, but it gives the illusion that it does. The way that it is gathered in the front makes the top drape out in front just lovely. I also love that the corset style lacing in front can be done tighter or you can pull the string a little more loosely to give a more casual effect. All in all, it's a really great top to be worn with jeans or leggings!",
