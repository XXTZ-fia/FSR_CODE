Had it for almost a year and well, I have to say that although the material is really sturdy and has kept its beauty...what was its downfall was the zipper. I advise that you do your best NOT to stuff it with heavier things such as coin purses, make-up bags, sunscreen, keys, and such all at once. I mean, you MIGHT be able to get away with putting heavier things in this bag but the one I had made the zipper give out and now it doesn't stay zipped anymore even if I only put lighter things in it. Maybe I got the gnarly one, idk, but I would caution to pack light if you want it to last.",

I ended up breaking the zipper and ripping out the teeth.

I've tried every technique trying to zip up the bag in a way that won't cause the zipper to fail, and nothing has worked for more than a couple days. Even when I manage to get it zipped up properly, it'll just come undone with the slightest jarring. You MUST be extremely gentle handling this bag and it's zipper or else you'll end up with the same issue as me and my aforementioned coworker. Very cute design, faux leather holds up great, and I love the extra pockets + size of the bag. It's a shame that the zipper is poorly made/sewn in.",

Then the Amazon brand one I had saved is not available I'm black anymore sadly.  Then I stumbled upon this. I personally like the gold studs on it. Not all goths hate other colors of metal. It looks more expensive than it is.  So far after a month of heavy use its in great shape. Only one mark from when I accidently put my heavy metal makeup kit on a strap. But even that isn't noticeable.  It has a hidden pocket on the back so I put my cards and cash in that instead of my reciculously huge coach wallet that uses half the space haha.  I do not recommend filling this full though as this style of bag will wear out faster if you do. I keep the bare minimum in it, which for me is more than most haha. Face powder, lipsticks 4x, lip balm, a bottle of pills, mints, a crystal to be safe lol, and eyelash glue and tweezers.  You should give it a try. For the price you really can't beat it. Plus bats!!!! I try to never wear less than 2-3 Bats at a time  Its been 4 months since I bought this and with daily wear its in perfect condition!! It's very strong and durable.
