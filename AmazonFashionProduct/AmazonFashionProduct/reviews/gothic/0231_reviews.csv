It feels and looks like three different fabrics an average Seamstress could have stitched together at home to ‘simple fix’ a shirt they had previously loved and damaged.

I’ll be keeping it because it does appear to be stitched together well but the only place I plan on wearing it now is athletic occasions.,2
