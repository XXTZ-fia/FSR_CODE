It's perfect! The belt is flattering, although I'm going to have to shorten it, and I've bought a petticoat, but not sure if I'll need it. I absolutely love the buckle embellishments on the shoulders. They work to loosen or tighten based on your bust size.  The dress ia an a-line dress in that the 'waist' is just below the bust line flattering any figure. I can't wait to show this off!",2

I will say that if you want the skirt to look as full as it does in the picture, you will need to wear some sort of petticoat underneath. Overall, great quality for the price.",

TetrisTidyingTechniques,"Cute and comfortable, but pricey",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CQVH7PIG03KH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9YHKV8Y,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 21, 2023",Color: Blue_1Size: 1X,,"This is a stylish dress with a pretty rose-patterned lace. The blue color is beautiful, but it's a bit shinier than I was expecting. It's comfortable and the length is about 3 inches below the knees. I'm 5' 6"", 42"" bust, 35"" waist, around 183lbs, and usually an L or XL. According to the size chart, I'm an L, but I ordered a 1X by mistake. It still fits, but it's a bit big, so the L would have fit perfectly. Unfortunately, the belt is just too big for me. I'll undo the stitches and adjust the size though, because the belt is cute and pairs really nicely with the dress. The fabric underneath the lace is quite stretchy but really thin and, sadly, it seems to lack the level of quality I was hoping for. Considering this information, I'd say this dress is kinda pricey ($45.99 at the time).  I'm reviewing the [ROSE GAL Women Plus Size 1950s Vintage Fit and Flare Knee Length Cocktail Dress] [1X] [Blue_1].",7

The fabric is very detailed with a shimmer look on the blue that makes it look expensive.  The cut is very curvy figure flattering.  True to size and I love that the designer allowed enough room in the chest area while also keeping the waist fitted.  I often find fitted dresses to snug for DD chest but this one is perfect!,

cloagirl,"Runs large, but cute fit!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15UZH7K1XPKEA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9YHKV8Y,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 1, 2023",Color: Blue_1Size: 2X,,"As a bigger gal, I'm usually worried about things I order running small, so imagine my surprise when this one actually ran large, though I did go by their measurements. I got the blue and black dress with buckled shoulder straps, and my biggest concern is the top of the dress, it was roomier in the back of the top than I was expecting. Which makes it so the fabric doesn't cling unflatteringly to the shoulder rolls, which is a plus, but it also doesn't feel super secure around you.  Even so, I think it still looks nice on me, so I'm not too disappointed - or at least I won't be until I shed a few pounds and it won't fit right at all anymore. Though I might try to alter it because I really do like this dress. I know I had a couple complaints about it, but even running large, it manages to be a flattering fit, and I'm excited for a chance to wear it out.",

I'm about 5'10"" and the top points of the hem come up a *touch* higher than I'd like (backup bile shorts for a windy day!!)
