The ones I kept all exceeded expectations. They are incredibly flattering, and glow just like in the site pictures. I enjoy an alternative fashion sense, and this kind of dress wear is so fun to incorporate into my provocative style.  Form-wise, the fabric is pretty good quality. The long bottom is an interesting touch. The collar, I understand as an element of a tuxedo waistcoat, but as I use these as vests, it brings a pleasing dramatic element. And their adjustment strap in the back, while many vests come with two strands and a strap, this is one solid mechanism which makes adjustment *so* easy, and doesn't loosen itself out with time.  Undesirables: the red black one is a lot more brown in real life than red, which was disappointing. It didn't look good. Additionally, this is not tailored wear, and can fit odd depending on body shape/type. I sit between a male's medium and large. Large was massive, and medium is *just* large, and so sits slightly forward from where might be ideal. It still looks great, I only include this for objectivity's and honesty's sakes.  This product is a fine intersection between affordability and quality - not perfect necessarily by either axis' concerns, yet a stylish, lovely compromise.",13

At first I was unsure of the color and fit, because it looked very dark, glittery (biggest surprise), and large when I pulled it out of the package. But it was absolutely perfect; mind blown.  Being a naturally large-chested trans man (about a 38DD, haven't measured in awhile), it's impossible to find clothes that fit well and make me look masculine, especially without a binder. I typically size up drastically so I can wear my favorites any day of the week. I did so here and expected it not to look flattering after tightening to fit, which was absolutely untrue. It fit perfectly over my chest and when tightened, still held a flattering masculine shape. The color manipulates the light just right to make me appear even sharper; I thought that I had pecs to rival Chris Evans!  The pattern and lining are absolutely phenomenal and high quality, which is a wonderful bonus to the fit and color. Absolutely recommend to larger-chested transmascs looking for classy formalwear they can wear with or without a binder. Wearing without a binder mimics the appearance of wearing one; I haven’t tried it with a binder yet. Only downside is how it flares around the arms because of the presence of breasts, but that's not a noticeable detail from the front. Gender euphoria all around. Will be buying more in the future.",47
