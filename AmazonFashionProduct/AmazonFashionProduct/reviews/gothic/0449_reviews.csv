The hat actually is misspelled lmao Says “Agein” instead of “Again”. No idea how they didn’t catch it after mass producing it",
C.A. Gruver,CHECK THE SPELLING...!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36JNSERYE0GCV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DQQCT363,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: One SizeColor: New Black Gothic Maga Hat,Verified Purchase,"While the hat is a fine quality, 'Again' is misspelled in the slogan. The description should note them as irregulars and the price should reflect that fact. Continue your search... there are others out there, for the same price, without the error.",
Bri Horn,Nice Hat,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R378WOC55U5FN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DQQCT363,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: One SizeColor: New Black Gothic Maga Hat,,"This has is very well constructed and I was surprised with how perfectly it fit my head. I like the style, the colors allow you pair it with virtually another color. The material is very thick and feels like it has longevity. Great way to show support without being so loud. great buy, looks great and the price is reasonable given the quality of the item.",
Robert Novak,"Looks like the official hat it emulates, but is a smaller one-size size.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IO3YSN6KQSAS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DQQCT363,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: One SizeColor: New Black Gothic Maga Hat,,"I bought the official version of this hat, and when this version came up for review, I figured I'd give it a try.  At just under $13, with next day delivery available, it has definite advantages.  But the typography seems to have been changed enough to avoid legal conflicts (not that gothic lettering is always that clear in the first place, but the ""ga"" in ""Again"" looks really strange, as well as some other tweaks to the typestyle.  Also, this hat fits comfortably (almost perfectly) inside the official hat, so for people with larger heads like me (I wear a 7 7/8 to 8), it's not going to fit well even fully expanded in the back.  In the two-hat picture, this hat is the one on the top with the two ""vent"" dots above the type. In the ""stacked"" photo, this one is inside the official hat. Almost a perfect fit.  It gets the idea across, and for an average to small head it's a great deal. I won't be able to actually wear it, so it will be shelf candy in my office.",
J,A nice hat BUT child sized,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RK53ULVCQOA8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DQQCT363,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Size: One SizeColor: New Black Gothic Maga Hat,,The hat I received was constructed well and looked nice. BUT once I tried it on I could tell its smaller than an adults hat. Disappointed it fits small/strange.,
Laurie Partridge,Cool Looking Gothic MAGA,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B67KBS3EV2B0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DQQCT363,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Size: One SizeColor: New Black Gothic Maga Hat,,"This is probably my favorite MAGA hat in my collection. The cap looks great in black. The gothic script is so cool looking with the American flag on the side. My only issue is that it’s a little small on me & I don’t think I have a big head. Still, it’s a great look.",
Christopher Lee,It's an AVERAGE QUALITY Goth MAGA HAT! I Was Hoping For b Better Quality!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2911ULQPPD7YL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DQQCT363,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Size: One SizeColor: New Black Gothic Maga Hat,,"OK let me start out by Saying I'm a HUGE Fan of President Donald Trump and I consider him an American Hero especially after he took a bullet for this country during his Campaign Rally in Butler, PA! Anyone who loves this country as much as Donald Trump is a Hero and Deserves to be President!  On the Flip Side I'm not too much of a Fan of this Gothic MAGA Hat! The Stitching is Excellent and the Overall Style is Great! I give the Hat 5 Stars for both of those categories!!  HOWEVER, my big problem and concern with this hat is the actual hat itself!! It's very Flimsy, The Material is thin and there's no way this thing would last a couple of washes in the washing machine!  I've seen other MAGA Hats that are thick quality and have a nice hold to them in terms of shape! This thing unfortunately is NOT that type of hat! Therefore on the Craftsmanship and Materials used in the hat itself I'm rating it 1 Star!  Therefore, with all things considered, I'm giving this hat a 3 Star Rating Overall!! Trust me when I say this but that's a Generous 3 Stars considering the actual hat itself is made of a very Cheap Material!!  Nonetheless, I always try to give my best and honest opinion on items that I review and this hat is no more than 3 Stars! ⭐⭐⭐",
