Amazon Customer,The plus sizes are not made as well as the regular sizes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35R0D3UOCAQN1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Size: 5X-LargeColor: Red-halter,Verified Purchase,"The black “corset” is attached and only goes along the front. The dress is not made well. My friends and I got these dresses to match for a masquerade ball. They are both skinny. I am not. The black one was well constructed in size large. The purple of was gorgeous in size small. The red in a 5X? Costume fabric and very cheaply made. Also, it runs small. I had to get a 5X even thought I wear a 2X in regular clothing.",
Tara Hilder,Looks nothing like the photo,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TBZH68ZGZOSI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 21, 2024",Size: 3X-LargeColor: Black-halter,Verified Purchase,Looks nothing like the photos.

Leah shank,Beautiful!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3A16BXRL1VWN7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 16, 2024",,Verified Purchase,So I purchased this for my 11 year old as part of her costume and let me tell you she rocked it! She is very developed for her age and filled this out perfectly. It is stunning and Incredibly lightweight. The size fit like a glove. So the sizes are on point. She was able to comfortably move around. It's definitely machine washable. I always turn things inside out and hung it to dry.,
Michelle Heinz,Arms a little tight at first,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E5FEGNJPXF8U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 6, 2024",,,"My only negative mostly is the waist would have preferred it to go all around and a little thicker material but dress is cute for what I was aiming for, (gypsy style). The arms with the lace was a little snug but after a while the lace started to relax. Will post an update once the event gets here.",
Andrew G.,Different dress than pictured,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP5KGTU3QABAE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 28, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Red-halter,Verified Purchase,Center black piece isn't it's own piece. It's part of the dress and only goes half way around. Also didn't come with the black laces shown either. Cheaply made for nearly $50 dress.,

Michael Brown,The purple doesn't match.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R332M69HZBKIUW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"1.0 "," the United States "," November 16, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Purple-long Sleeve,Verified Purchase,The purple didn't match the pictures. We bought this for my daughter and it just didn't look like the pictures. We were disappointed that it was such a dull purple-ish plum-ish instead of that nice royal purple in the pictures.,
Clara Dymnicki,To big,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7GCNRABIT61L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 16, 2023",,Verified Purchase,The dress was too big and the material was very cheap for the price.,2

Glendy Moreno,Not as pictured or described,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKM7DPI3LQHNQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 3, 2023",,Verified Purchase,The bottom of the dress is sheath does not have a high-low effect or the flow as pictured. The “corset” is just simulated it contains holes in the front and comes with a shoelace like string to feed through. The lace on top is low quality very delicate feels as if it will rip. The shipping was also very long.,2
Tina,Looks Really Cheap,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YIFSZB16RA2D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 29, 2023",,Verified Purchase,Dress is so cheap looking in person. Was going to wear this for Halloween but I'd be way too embarrassed to wear this. Also corset part is just stitched on the front so when you turn it looks ridiculous because it doesn't continue to the back side.,4
jennifer phelan,This is awful,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P5JDF6LTVR2Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 24, 2023",Size: 5X-LargeColor: Red-halter,Verified Purchase,Quality is absolutely awful as is fit. Not flattering and very cheaply made. Fabric is thinner than most pajama fabric.  This is the ugliest dress I have ever bought and I won’t even wear it for Halloween,7
Debbie Rodríguez,Return policy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JA2IMFHLFESD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"1.0 "," the United States "," July 21, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"This dress was never used because it was to big, and now I can’t return it because the window closed",
kari gist,Did not look like the picture,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R164URRCWU91O9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"1.0 "," the United States "," June 28, 2023",Size: 4X-LargeColor: Black-halter,Verified Purchase,It didn't look like the picture at all from the chest down it's supposed to have two layers but it only had the slip part that supposed to prevent people from seeing your underwear it didn't have the flowy second layered the picture looked fancy and pretty but what I got looked cheap like what did they do remove the second layer of the dress? The dress isn't ugly or unwearable but I do feel like I got scammed cuz it didn't look like the picture at all so I'm disappointed with this purchase,7
Kindle Customer,Very cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39SVHXDYK9GP0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2022",,Verified Purchase,I was hesitant to purchase with the weird size chart. It’s always tricky being a bigger girl on here. I’m usually a 1x in torrid tops and a 20 on bottom. I ordered the 4x and it fits perfectly,18
Stephanie,Cheap material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AM1DDEKFQYM5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 31, 2022",,Verified Purchase,"What the picture looks like on Amazon vs what it looks like in person are two separate things. The material used on this is absolutely cheap. I’ve found better dresses at Ross for way cheaper and has better material. Not to mention, if you do not wear a bra you nipples will show. Do not advise spending 50 bucks on this. You would be better going off going to Hot Topic.",
Liz Jimenez,Pensé seria de menor calidad. pero superó mis expectativas.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FCBLE10JNEFK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 13, 2022",,Verified Purchase,Pedí una talla más grande ya que siempre en los brazos quedan ajustados y este quedó perfecto,2
Heather France,Beautiful for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROHZBK1SQJUDU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9XHLZC1,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 25, 2020",,Verified Purchase,"I ordered this dress in the bright red. It’s a little more orange-red than pictured but still beautiful. I am 5’10 and the length was perfect on me. Waist Line  was a bit short but I assume that is related to my height not a problem with the dress.  The dress is not perfect on me because I am tall, but if you are shorter or Just shorter waisted, the dress is beautiful for the price.",4
