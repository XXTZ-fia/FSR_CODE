While I’m an elder emo year round, I’m not much of a dress girlie. This one may just convert me, though! It was SUPER comfy, VERY flattering around my insecurities (midsection and arms), and BEYOND affordable! The lace did require a little trimming here and there to take care of some minor fraying on the sleeves but it was no biggie. I lasted all day in this thing and can’t wait to wear it for future occasions like our belated family reception. And it showed up fabulous in the teasers we got from our photographer!

But after one single wash the dress was a disaster. The stretchy lace fabric pilled and bunched up, and for some reason or another the dress hot a whole lot shorter even after washing in cold water. Cute dress, if you plan on wearing it once. Other than that kinda of a waste of money",
