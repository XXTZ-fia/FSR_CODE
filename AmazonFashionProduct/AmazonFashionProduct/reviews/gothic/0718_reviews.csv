JH,"Well made, and nice fit.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14PEPEEF4AAAR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4HMQYZ3,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 6, 2024",Color: RedSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"I'm 5'3"", weigh 112, 34DD bust, 25"" waist, & small framed. Wasn't sure on sizing because my bust is always too big for this type of cut if the waist isn't going to swallow me. I got the S & M in red, and will say that the red isn't as pretty in person. It's a more dull red than pic, but it at least doesn't have the orange undertone of so many red clothes (I would have sent both back if that had been the case. The medium fit me nicely. Plenty of room in the bust, and didn't look oversized on ribs and waist. It fit well enough I almost didn't try on the small, but did. The small still fit in the bust without looking weird on my bust, and it fit slightly more snuggly. The upper back felt a bit tight when I rolled my shoulders, but not horribly so. I normally wear a small top, but depending on style have gotten XS & M sometimes. I could have easily gotten away with keeping either of them, and looked nice. Neither had the button gap issue anywhere either. I ended up deciding to keep the small and returned the medium. I washed it in lukewarm water, and dried on low heat. It took that well, but to my disappointment will need some ironing. The buttons are difficult to button. The ""button holes"" are TINY elastic bands that have to be stretched around the half ball type buttons. My small fingers still had trouble. Overall I do like the blouse, and imagine I'll have it for many years to come. I believe that getting your normal size should be a good choice on sizing.",

Seriously, no cleavage.  I couldn't believe it!  The lacing in the back allowed me to synch it so it enhanced my waist, giving me the illusion of an hourglass figure.  My pudgy belly was even camouflaged, as were my chubby upper arms.  This is the most flattering top I've found in the last 10 years.  Bonus: the material is so soft!",3

I tried steaming it in the dryer keeping in mind others negative reviews about the buttons & ribbon. I simply undid all the buttons & removed the ribbon (left it out completely) so there was no tension on those parts of the fabric then put it on gentle cycle dry with a bunch of ice cubes. Two 15 min cycles like this did not damage the garment but it barely got out any wrinkles either. Unfortunately my steamer broke or I’d try that next. I’m afraid to wash it yet because I need it for a cosplay event coming up soon, it was a last minute replacement for changing weather. I might return it if I can’t get the wrinkles out & just borrow my partner’s cotton masc. peasant shirt instead. (Which I didn’t want to do hence the purchase) For the price this is very cheap material & more akin to something you’d find on Shein though the design is very pretty & well thought out. The ribbon is also super cheap which is kind of unnecessary considering wholesale poly satin ribbon isn’t very expensive. If I had gotten the black I’d definitely swap out the ribbon, but the green will be difficult to color match. It’s too bad the fabric quality doesn’t match the design. If it was a cotton blend or even a higher quality poly/rayon blend that would wear better I would give it 5*. I don’t think I’ll be ordering anything else from Scarlet Darkness unless they improve their quality, despite them having tons of cute items. I’m so tired of Amazon becoming a more expensive Shein or AliExpress for the same questionable quality as a hub for any seller regardless of the price point, it’s disappointing. It’s like playing Russian roulette with your wallet.",3

It's also a good shirt for Renfaire or steampunk/pirate/Victorian cosplay. I ordered a size up, and it's a bit looser in the bust than I expected. The torso is customizable due to the ribbons along the back. If you aren't used to corset lacing, it may be helpful to have someone help you set the top the first time - you can reach around and just draw the ribbons from the bottom, but that ends up making the torso tighter than you may like it. No issues with the front buttons or snaps, but the snaps look delicately sown on and may need reinforcement with stronger thread. The fabric is double-gauze, which is soft and lovely - no concerns with transparency. The elastic in the sleeves may be bothersome if you have larger arms. It isn't as stretchy there as I would like. Given it's flat-packed, be prepared for wrinkles. Steaming probably required. Given the button loops, lace details, & fabric, I'll be handwashing this or putting in a mesh bag on the Delicates cycle of the machine, then hanging to dry. My package had a first-use seal before you could open the main bag, and included a tissue insert. Clearly this was not a returned item. Very happy with this shirt & the vendor.",6

And, the stretchy sleeves were nice because I have bigger arms.  The shape is flattering and the lace detailing gives it an authentic look.

This shirt seemed to be the perfect mix or wearability and costume that my closet so desperately needs. It is, but it isn't. Upon opening the package, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the shirt was made for a mass produced item. Once I put it on though, my hopes were dashed. It is both too big, and too small at the same time. Pulling the corset in tight enough to make the top look flattering results in gaping buttons, and a huge bubble of fabric in the back above it. The draping along the neck is much too big and falls unflatteringly. As a sewist, I think I can fix it, maybe, but I am currently disappointed and the poor shirt is assigned to the ""maybe someday"" section of my closet.  Frownie Face.",

The wash instructions didn't say anything out of the ordinary so I didn't stress it. Yeah. See the pics for the end result. The ribbon pulled out the loops on the back that let you use the ribbon to tighten the blouse, and two buttons came off the front and were lost. 😓  So yeah, got one use out of this shirt, which makes mea really sad because it was perfect in all other respects.
