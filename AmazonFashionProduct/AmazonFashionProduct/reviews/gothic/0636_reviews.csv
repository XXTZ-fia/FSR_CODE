Jill H,Fits perfectly,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PA61HARCCZ0B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBZNZRLD,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 16, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Navy Blue,,"I like that it fits perfectly and that it not to tight or loose around me and that.it was not to long. It doesn't have much weight to it, it is really light weight. It kept me pretty warm when I was out in the rain. Quality was really good on it, it was really stretchy, I love the Renaissance style to it, it remind me of assassin's creed games, and it is very comfortable to just wear around the house I was getting a lot of good comments on it as well.",
H. Collins,"Looks good but very thin material, NOT cotton as advertised",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSY087AXLRDF3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBZNZRLD,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 23, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Navy Blue,,"Update: Added a star because despite all of the problems listed below, my wife uses this constantly as a housecoat so it does have some utility.  This is not really a cloak as it has sleeves, nor is it a proper coat. The material is very thin and seems like it is not very durable, nor would it be effective at protection from the elements. It is a good looking accessory for some sort of ambiguous cosplay or LARP or Halloween costume, but is not very functional or warming at all. The description says ""renaissance"" but I challenge you to find a renaissance period garment with this pattern or design. Note the description also says ""cotton"" as the material but this is plainly not cotton, and the tag says ""100% Polyester.""",

The fabric is ridiculously thin and feels VERY cheap. I know from experience with similar fabrics that t's also of the type to really wrinkle easily and be difficult to get the wrinkles out.  I also can't believe how cheap and unsuitable the zipper is. I use to work in a fabric store and it's comparable to the industrial type we sold by the yard for use in things like upholstery covers. It's heavy with chunky metal teeth and the glide is very rough feeling. It's ridiculous to have used it for a garment closure.  About the only good thing I can say is that it is true to size.",

Fits small - definitely recommend sizing up.,
