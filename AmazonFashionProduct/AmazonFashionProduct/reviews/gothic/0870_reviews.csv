Kpop Romantasy,Comfortable for Larger Sizes!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3H1V875HLNNP3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCJYBHTG,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2025",Color: Navy BlueSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"This was so much fun to wear to Ren fair!! I was going for a Ravenclaw princess Mage. 😁💙 The blue color is striking, the lace and details are gorgeous, and the neckline is stunning! I was worried it wouldn't fit well due to the elastic waist and side zipper, but it fit very well... snug but the elastic adds give. The length was perfect for me I am about 5'5"" and 250 lbs. The neckline in the back was not too low, just above the middle of my back.  Some complaints were of the material - I AM sensitive to fabrics, and I sew/quilt myself. I found it to be a durable material, but not overly scratchy to wear. My skin was fine after wearing all day.. no irritations. 😄",

Beautiful dress with beautiful details and fabric. The pockets are fantastic. I’m 5’1 and 220ish and the 2xl fit like it was made for me. I did try the XL as well and while it fit and was a little more shapely it also was more snug on the arms and chest area making the arms shorter and just not as flattering. There is a liner to cover almost to the knees. The length on me was a little more than midi and a little less than maxi which is just right for adding another under skirt if you wanted. I added a brown underskirt for a renfest look. It’s also a lovely length without. I could even wear this to church. It’s not a cheap costume dress. I will be ordering more colors!,
Amazon Customer,Returned but still 4 stars,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GF6MS3ZIDRJP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCJYBHTG,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 20, 2024",Color: GreenSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"So, I’m very busty. I have to start with that because the problem that made me return this was just the fit across the bust. While it did technically fit, it was snug enough on the bust that it made the shoulders fit oddly and pulled a bit which made it unflattering ON ME. Emphasis on that because the dress was LOVELY. The details were exactly as shown. The dress felt like a very nice quality! Not cheap or thin feeling. A nice weight material and a lovely silky slip lining. As the add shows it’s not ankle length so if you’re planning to layer with a chemise for a costume or renfaire (as I was) keep that in mind. Was bummed this did work for me as it was really beautiful.",

I bought this one not knowing what to expect and, to be honest with you, it was an incredibly nice dress. The material is thick and not see through, it's also super cute and can be used outside of ren fairs. There's a small area with some material pressing in that can be a little annoying of you don't wear an underdress but it's not that noticable a feel for most people. Highly recommend if your looking for a cute AF and versatile dress.",

I am a chunky size 18, (ie my clothes are tight right now), but I was able to fit into the XX-Large sized dress.  The dress was pretty tight in the chest and waist, yet my biceps, which are large, went through the more than adequate arm holes and were very comfortable in the beautiful bell sleeves.  A standard sized 18 would fit this dress perfectly.I am extremely impressed with this dress and would have no problem wearing it to a nice restaurant or event.  Yes, you can use it for Halloween or Ren Fair, but to me, the quality is much too high to used only once or twice a year.

It could be the style, but this one seems to be truer to the size chart than another one, which is good for this dress, but I wonder about the overall consistency in sizing across the manufacturing of this brand.Scarlet Darkness has really nice designs and I really like the design of this dress.  It fits well.  It is not my everyday style, but for cosplay, it is definitely a keeper.  One thing I noticed was the weight of the dress.  It seems to pull down onto my shoulders, not horribly, but enough to notice.  The skirt is lined, but neither of those layers add a lot of weight.  The only thing that I can think of is the elastic at the waist.  There is a large band of shirred fabric in the back and it seems that the weight is coming from that panel.Looking at the fabric, I would not put this in the dryer on heat.  I have had clothes made of viscose and it tends to shrink.  I would suggest washing in cold on the gentle cycle and hang dry or even dry clean because this fabric has a tendency to wrinkle.",

This, where I did get the XL, if my boobs were bigger it would not fit.  This is running a little smaller than the skirt but it still fits ok and is comfortable.I like this company because their clothing does not feel flimsy as you would expect from something in this price range.  No, their clothing feels solid and durable.  Although only time will tell on that one.One downside, for me anyway, is the built in slip.  Comes to a little above my knees and... again for me.... is a little too form fitting.  The slip, IMO, should flow with the rest of the skirt area.  I may cut that out and buy something separate.I highly recommend this clothing line if you are into period pieces, cosplay, or just want to step out of the everyday.  Check out their web site, a much larger selection than here on Amazon.",
