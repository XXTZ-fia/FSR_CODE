The sleeves shrunk, the velvet rolled and it became unwearable. I washed it in delicate and had planned to let it dry flat, but my mother in law put it in the dryer and ruined it. So if there's any chance you might accidentally throw it in the dryer: it will shrivel up and feel bad on your skin, but if you're good at paying attention to that kind of thing that shouldn't be a problem.",

Emily W.,"Too small, poor quality",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMS68Y9FY1GJQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49VDRVL,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 4, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Black Gothic,Verified Purchase,"This top is WAY too small. I ordered a large and I don't think it was even a child's large. The fabric had some give to it, so I was able to squeeze in, but it was very uncomfortable. The fabric was itchy and low quality too with lots of strings. Other than looking small (barely covering my bra), I guess it looked okay overall, but there are plenty of similar things out there and this definitely wasn't worth it.",6
Jasmina Loves Maltese',Very cute but very short,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RARNLTKS7NFOP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49VDRVL,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 5, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: Red Gothic,Verified Purchase,"I don't mind this being short, I think it's because of my 38d cups haha. It's cute. If your arms are thicker than mine I might look elsewhere though, as the lace is only a little stretchy. I thought it would be really stretchy as that is what I would have used, as I sew myself.  Also I would have made the top curve out a tiny bit longer in front to account for boobs. Over all for the price its a good find. It is astetically pleasing and comfortable.",15
Ciara,Super cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1A9PEUYHHX9DU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49VDRVL,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 18, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black Gothic,Verified Purchase,"Super cute! Super stretchy and fit perfectly to cover my harness but show just the right amount of skin for me. Also surprisingly warm! Will update after going out with friends.  UPDATE: So as you can tell from my outfit, I like to wear chains, unfortunately the lace got caught in them a bit but surprisingly it never ripped and was pretty easy to get loose. Just be cautious if you are wearing chains or something it can easily get snagged in. It also tended to roll up a bit at my stomach but I am not sure if this was due to my harness underneath. I was also moving around a lot which didn’t help. I also didn’t notice any staining of skin that some other reviewers mentioned. Overall was still super cute, got a lot of compliments from my friends and it kept me warm somehow in 40 degree weather. Would give a 4.5",5
