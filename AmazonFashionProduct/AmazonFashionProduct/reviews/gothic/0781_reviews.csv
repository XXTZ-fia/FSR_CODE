Great for getting a good fit in theory, an absolute nightmare in practice. 2. I don't know how people find this thing comfortable. The fabric that's facing your skin leaves a lot to be desired for comfort. 3. On the topic of the fabric, it simultaneously doesn't breath and also doesn't absorb sweat. So you sweat like crazy in this top and then get to become an itchy, wet mess. Horrible experience on hot days.",6
