A little more subtle than silver studs on black (or any other combination).  If I have one complaint, I suppose the actual belt material feels just a *tad* on the cheaper side.

I think they will work best as waist belts rather than a belt you are relying on to keep your pants up!

The buckles don't close flush so they look a little cheap. I get WHY it is that way but rather than have the buckle open in the middle, it would make more sense to have them open on the end of the buckle so it doesn't look so cheap.  Overall, these are fine.

The only con about these is I am not sure how long the closures are going to last. The closures are not of the best quality metal and the hooks might break with too much pressure. Also note, the hooks don't have a huge hook in them so when you breathe in too much and your waist shrinks it might come unhooked. That has happened a few times already. Not too big of a deal if you have belt loops but most the dresses I wear them with do not have loops. Might need to macgyver something to keep them together a bit better. Cost for quality is to be expected. Leather is nicer than expected.",
