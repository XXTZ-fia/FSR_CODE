D_Doll,Cute for the Halloween season,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NSDUUD2DQLKJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3MY1XJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 23, 2024",,,"I decided to try this dress and it IS cute, but some things I noticed: The skirt looks better with a crinoline/underskirt beneath it to give it that flared out, more pin up style look to it that works so well with these cuts of dresses.  The top is low cut, and no matter which way I laced up the front, it wants to show cleavage. I will most likely attempt to sew the two sides together to allow for a bit more modesty, and to help the front lay down better. The faux leather the grommets are anchored to is a bit cheap looking, and the whole dress could have been improved if a heavier velvet was used there instead. That's just my personal preference - for some, that leather bit may be a selling point.  This dress itself has some stretch to it, and the purple color beneath the lace overlay peeks through well, and the tones of purple look different depending on the lighting, which is really fun.  I love that the straps are adjustable in the back.  For my use, I will probably pair with a v neck cropped black cardigan to show off the strap detail at the front of the dress while covering some of the faux leather detail, a black crinoline underskirt and vintage styled peep toe pumps.  Really fun for an early spooky season dress, and can be passed off as a skirt if paired with the right tops, so it gets bonus points for having that bit of versatility. It lost some points for not having a built in underskirt to add to the definition/line of the dress.",2
A.,"Beautiful color with lace overlay, very low cut",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MMT2HRU9X8XW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC3MY1XJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 19, 2024",,,"I love the way the lace overlay looks over the purple polyester underlayer, gives a really subtle and beautiful effect. The neckline is as shown and pretty well done, a few tiny extra strings that were easy to cut and otherwise it's well sewn. It is very low cut, more than expected and will show your bra! For having a large chest the front tends to just hang straight down so it doesn't provide as much shape as I had hoped and will probably look best with a belt if you want the waist to cinch in (see photos). Nice length, I am 155lbs and 5'5"" for reference.",2
