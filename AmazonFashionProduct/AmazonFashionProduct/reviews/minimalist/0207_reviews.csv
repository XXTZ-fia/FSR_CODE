Many years ago I wore the Vibram five finger shoes, but eventually had to give them up due to the aforementioned bad ankle. Now that I'm back, I didn't want to go back to the 5 finger shoes, but definitely wanted to get back to zero drop and toe freedom. I purchased a few different pairs of this style shoe, but none were quite right... until I found this pair. I had the red pair for a couple weeks decided to get the white for my European vacation (cute enough to go with dresses or just pants or shorts). I'm not a very athletic person and live a pretty sedentary lifestyle (again, bad ankle made things very hard). So I knew that this might be really hard given the amount of walking to happen on vacation. But it was a total success!! I did 7-10 miles per day according to the apple watch. This was hands down the best shoes I could have hoped for. I took a spare pair of hiking style shoes along just in case. I wore them one day and my feet were miserable. My legs and feet hurt without a doubt since they were doing mileage beyond their norm. And walking on the cobblestones in Belgium and Italy was really tough on the feet. But there is no better option that I could have had. My feet and legs grew so much stronger over the course of those three weeks. I wouldn't recommend newbies going that hard that fast, but I knew kind of what to expect. Now my goal is just to maintain that strength and keep wearing these shoes!! Highly recommend. One other note - I did add a really flat (zero drop) cheap gel insoles that I got a the big retail W store just for some extra protection. Perfect. If you are new to barefoot, I would highly recommend these as great transition pairs. The toe space and zero drop are really great.",6

If you have children, you may remember the pediatrician telling you not to put them in shoes too soon after they begin walking. I'm guessing it's that ""barefoot feel"" that shoes like this give. It's sending signals to your brain about how to use your body based on what's underfoot. And the unevenness feels like a foot massage. All those signals you don't get when you wear shoes with a stiff sole and your toes bound into a narrow shape.  Try a pair and you'll see what I mean.

They feel great for all-day wear, whether I'm running errands or going for a casual walk.  Great Price Point:  For the quality and comfort they offer, these shoes are surprisingly affordable. It's refreshing to find a well-made minimalist option without breaking the bank. They provide excellent value for anyone looking to explore barefoot-style footwear.  Lightweight Design:  The lightweight construction makes them feel almost like you're walking barefoot.

Zero Drop Sole:  The zero drop sole promotes a natural running gait and encourages foot strength. I’ve found them beneficial for my foot health, as they allow my feet to move as nature intended.  Sizing Consideration:  The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that the sizing can be a little tricky. I recommend checking the size guide carefully, as they may run slightly larger or smaller depending on the style and fit you're used to.  Overall Satisfaction:  The Saguaro Forestep Ⅰ shoes have exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, style, and affordability.

However, in my experience, this wasn’t the case. I typically wear Merrell barefoot shoes in size US 10 Men/EUR 44, so I ordered US 9.5-10 Men. They turned out to be a bit small. The shoes delivered are labeled as EUR 43, which is incorrect since most manufacturers map Men’s US 10 to EUR 44. Given that these shoes are US 9.5-10 Men, the size delivered should be 43.5 EUR or 44 EUR. If you typically wear Men’s US 10, I suggest ordering 10.5 Men.  Otherwise, these are pretty average shoes, nothing spectacular. They are comfortable with enough room in the toebox, even with the smaller size I received.  One issue that makes me dislike these shoes is the plasticky sound they make when walking over hard surfaces like tiles or wood floors. I haven’t noticed this issue with any other shoes I own.  Overall, they are decent shoes but not comparable to branded barefoot shoes I’ve used in the past. At their current price of $53, I would really think twice about saving $20-30 by buying these shoes versus paying $70-80 for branded shoes.",6
