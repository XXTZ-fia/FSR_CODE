Mr.Papillon,NOT wide toe box!!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C8U6V80KVLHD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D54TSJZP,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Size: 10Color: White,Verified Purchase,"I have feet that fit normally in regular shoes easily, never had to buy wide but I’ve been trying to give my toes room to splay for my foot health recently. Have had multiple barefoot shoes before this with no issues. I didn’t heed the other reviews saying these were a little narrow because they’re advertised as wide toe box and I don’t have particularly wide feet so I thought they’d be fine. BUT they are really really narrow! Do not buy these unless you actually have really narrow feet and want the zero drop. Also I have medium high foot volume and feel too much pressure on the top of my foot as well. I’m extra sad because these seem to have really high quality construction and I was really positive about them until I wore them for a while and felt the pinch. Ouch!",

Mei Ortega Tong,No hay suficiente espacio para los pies,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3F2WGBOXYM44O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D54TSJZP,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 18, 2024",Size: 7.5Color: Black,,"Tengo otros zapatos barefoot mucho más baratos, incluso unas sandalias Xero y nunca había tenido problemas. Estos zapatos son duros y además no hay suficiente espacio para mis pies (que son delgados), de hecho después de 6 horas de usarlos me dolían los dedos de los pies y casi se me hacen heridas. Los otros zapatos los he usado hasta por 24 horas en mis turnos de trabajo y con estos no soporté. Pésima compra por el precio. Positivo sólo puedo decir que se ven lindos.",
Happy cyclist,"Nice shoe, but sole under forefoot is pretty rigid",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X0X5IJK9AM96/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D54TSJZP,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 26, 2024",Size: 9Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"I enjoy Xero's sandals, especially the thin & flexible Aqua Cloud, so was hoping this closed-toe shoe would be similarly flexible.  The sole does flex behind the metatarsal joints, but no flex underneath the toes, which means I won't be using the toe muscles  much at all.  (Small as they are, toes are there to help stabilize while we walk, run, and climb -- whether or not we know we're using 'em  ;)  Sorry to return this otherwise nice shoe.",

Beth,I’ll wait and see.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AP6G72GW4QMO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D54TSJZP,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 27, 2024",Size: 8.5Color: Orion Blue,Verified Purchase,"I enjoy the color and the feel of these shoes. I ordered 8.5 women’s size as that is the same size as the Prio Suede pair I own and found the fit similarly.  I had an issue with the inner heel of the prio suede style wearing thin quickly from the inside within the first month of wear. The company responded that everyone wears their shoes a bit differently so the wear would be different for everyone. Based on their response to my previous issue I will have to wait and see whether or not the fuzz I’m seeing on the front of these shoes, after a few days of wearing them, will amount to holes in the near future.  These shoes are more breathable than the Prio Suede but still quite warm in the midsole and heel of the shoe, likely because despite the mesh appearance, the midsole and heel have quite a bit of padding to offer stability.  I have yet to see this brand living up to its cost. If I find this pair can’t hold up for even a few months I would rank the quality as low as any random shoe from Ross Dress for Less.",7
Boss,so not for me,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37RORH2H2RDX7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D54TSJZP,"2.0 "," the United States "," March 29, 2024",Size: 7.5Color: White,Verified Purchase,"I have been on a search for a cute white pair of barefoot shoes to wear with sundresses. I loved the Xero Dillon, but the color was off white & discolored in spots, so I returned them for these. These are NOT for my feet. I have slightly wide, high arch, high instep feet. I ordered a size up. These were soooo tight. These shoes are slip on. there is no tongue. the laces aren't necessary, they are for looks. So I couldn't adjust the laces to make it looser where needed. They look great and are nice & white. If you have the right shaped food they are probably perfect, but I wouldn't recommend them.",12

Especially these comfortable, slid on shoes! I can walk all day in these shoes & it's a breeze. I do wish the laces didn't actually need to be tied. Wish xero would do fake laces instead where they're tied forever & you ain't gotta mess with them.",5
