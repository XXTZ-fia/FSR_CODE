Amazon Customer,Nicest Wallet I've Owned,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UQOJBH6K36UV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCS13QC1,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2025",Color: Carbon Fiber,Verified Purchase,My old slim soft leather wallet with a similar clear ID pocket was getting grimy and it didn't do a great job protecting my cards. (My license split in my wallet while in my pocket). I picked this wallet since it was much cheaper than the Ridge wallet but had the same hard case. Everything from my previous wallet fit directly into this wallet without having to disclude anything. This wallet is about the size of a smartphone with a medium-sized case. Having a spring mechanism to pop the cards out would have been cool but I imagine the slider has fewer moving parts and will be more reliable in the long run. The mechanism has no play and is smooth. I don't love the money clip but it is firm and so far I've had no problems.,

So after a lot of browsing I found this wallet, and with a little trepidation ordered it.  When it arrived I was concerned that something about one third the size of my old wallet would hold everything I needed.  So I spent the next few days deciding if I was going to try it, and finally took the leap.  The wallet actually held everything from my old wallet with room for a few extra cards.  So I took it out for a test drive, it has a rather nice look, I can easily access any card in my wallet, the main card holder fans out the cards just enough to make retrieving them easy.  It is compact, light weight and easy to use much easier than my old wallet.  I recommend this to anyone who wants a compact wallet option.",

He may pretend to like it just to keep from hurting your feelings. There is really nothing to like about this wallet.  Do you really want all your cash on display every time you pull your wallet out? The Driver's License window is not clear. It's actually frosted so you can't read the license through the window. You would need to take the license out of the wallet every time you're asked to show it. They include instructions on how to unjam the popup credit card function, so I assume this is a possibility. So what happens when you're trying to check out in the store and you can't get your credit card out? If you carry your wallet in your back pocket, like I do, I can't imagine sitting on that brick all day. I didn't keep mine long enough to put it to the test but I can imagine the money clip and the hard case would wear a hole in your pocket in a short time.  No thanks on this wallet.

I couldn't. It actually worked. I then tried placing the card in one of the outside open slots and it worked just fine.  So if you are skeptical of the RFID dont be, it works.

I was looking for something with plenty of card slots, two outer slots for my most used cards, and an ID card slot (clear view of ID).  It also needed to be slim enough to easily adapt to different pockets (pants, coat, etc).  This wallet checked all of the boxes.  It also came in the Camel color I was looking for, came with a 2-year warranty, and came with screws and a small tool in case I need to tighten down the metal part or replace a missing screw in the future.  I've only had the wallet for a short time now (a few days), and already people out in public are asking to see my wallet in detail when I take it out.  I can't really see any downsides at this time.  If I had to pick something to improve upon, I'd say the magnetic part of the ID fold is a little weak.  It is definitely strong enough to hold, but the ID fold will move slightly as you move the wallet around.  This wallet is still a 5/5 product, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a money clip/card holder style wallet.",
