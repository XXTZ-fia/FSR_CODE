Incredibly comfortable shoes, despite the founder's YouTube commercial suggesting that they're uncomfortable and explaining why they will be uncomfortable to begin with.  Yes, for the first few days, there were some minor aches and pains in the feet, but that's from all of those years of not adequately using all of those smaller muscles, joint, and ligaments in the foot and ankle area from the pillow-plush cushioned shoes I've bought over the years.  After naturally adjusting my stride, pace, and step cadence walking, I feel much more stable and secure to the earth than previously.

A doctor suggested I get these and said it is her #1 suggestion for shoes, but the toe box is way too tight, especially compared to the Whitin shoes I am wearing right now.

I've used these shoes for group fitness classes and working out solo. Exercises include: - Box jumps - Deadlifts - Bench pressing - Squats  When it comes to running, these shoes are a no go. They hurt my feet on solid concrete and on trails after 2 minutes. For those instances, I choose Asics as they also have a wider toe box.  Overall, they've lasted quite a while and I'd give them two thumbs up. My 2 gripes though would be price and design. They are pricey and out of range for some who may not be able to afford or want to buy shoes that are over $100 dollars. Also, it'd be great if Xero updated their design and color ways. Yes, aesthetics are subjective but IMO, they aren't very good looking shoes. But I purchased them so what does that say about me? Lol!  I am a fan of Xero but in order to compete with the other brands out there, your designs need to 'wow' your audience. Other than that, it's a solid choice for working out in.",

I love running in those shoes but they are tiresome walking around in all day for hiking or city walking.  The opposite is true with the HFS II. The sole is clearly stiffer, possibly slightly thicker too. It's an awesome shoe for the whole day for minor hiking, city walking, going to work or going out.

I consider myself a moderate runner and have put approx. 2,200 miles on this pair. The Xero HFS was my first foray into “barefoot” shoes. I have always preferred a more flexible, light, minimalist shoe. Beforehand I ran in shoes like Nike free runners, or adidas swift’s.  Out of the box these shoes are incredibly flexible and very wide when compared to typical running shoes. They do not constrain your feet in the slightest. The lack of cushion on the sole takes a little time to get used to. I have a partial gravel driveway. Within the first few days I returned home from a run and landed on a single rock, leaving a nasty bruise. You learn really quickly to be mindful of your strides when wearing barefoot shoes.  The treads seem to be nearly indestructible. Every prior running shoe I've worn would be completely bald around the midpoint within a year. These have displayed very minimal wear around the ball of my foot. There are however some wear issues regarding other parts…  The top end of these separated very early around 3 months. This was first displayed on the inner side of the shoe around the ball area. I assume this is because that area experiences the most flex. At first it was very minor and remained this way until I had them for around a year. At this point the separation became more severe, eventually displaying on to the other (outer) side of the shoe. After 2 years I had to retire them as a hole started to form in between the top and the sole where they seperated.  I am a little disappointed that the sole started to separate so quickly. All of my other shoes would eventually get retired because the treads would wear out. However, these do hold the personal record for longest service life. The treads simply don't die. They are so incredibly comfortable after adapting that I can't go back to regular shoes. The unconstrained flexibility has ruined me. Putting on work boots or normal tennis shoes feels akin to wearing a vice after 2 years wearing Xero’s. If the tops didn't separate so badly they would be the perfect shoe.",

With these shoes, I can walk forever, but this has more to do with the flat feet working with barefoot/zero drop style than the Xero shoes themselves.  I went with Xero because they seemed like a legitimate brand that would stand behind their shoes. For this reason, I was willing to pay the extra money compared to others on Amazon. At this point, I have two pairs of their shoes, and they have a warranty for 5000 miles. I have put 1000 miles on the HFS shoes and you can see that they are severely worn and versatility is a little questionable depending on surface. The Prio have no more than 500 on them and the right shoe already has similar balding. There are runners claiming 4,000-6,000 miles on similar shoes costing $30-50 on here.  I have revised my rating to show that they do honor their warranty, but likely need a better email system.  I wasn’t pleased about a lack of response, but it turns out there support emails go to spam and they have in fact reached out. They have offered me their 5000 warranty, giving me the discount.

Owned 5 prior pair of zero HFS shoes only get 18 months out normally but this pair was gone in only 5 months of wear and spent over 2 months to get warranty claim processed but they no longer respond.,2
Tagifras,Transition sucked but my feet feel stronger,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G2AMWY58IV33/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTL15TNB,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 22, 2023",,Verified Purchase,I tried Vibrams before but felt silly and I couldnt ever bring myself to wear them fulltime. When I got these I did that thing your not supposed to and full switched to these as my only shoes. It sucked pretty bad for the first 2 weeks. Pretty much like walking on concrete barefoot the entire time. Now my feet feel stronger and I only ever get tired foot pain after a busy long week.  I would rate these higher but I tried wearing barefoot once or twice but the shoe rubs on my middle toe joint. Never seems to be a problem while wearing socks though.,
Michael Eldred,I Finally Found My Favorite Running Shoes!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RW3TBKLAWGEHR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTL15TNB,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 21, 2023",Size: 10Color: Pewter,Verified Purchase,"For years I had been purchasing different minimalist shoes, some expensive and some cheap, looking for a comfortable road running shoe that would last more than a couple of months before wearing through the sole. I run a little over 21 miles a week. I had ""settled"" on another brand of minimalist running shoes because they would last from four to five months. However, the quality began to wane badly, and the last pair I purchased didn't even last 2 months. My wife saw an ad for Xero shoes with a 5,000 mile guarantee and suggested them to me.  Wow, not only are these the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn, but they swallowed my running route whole and spit out the gravel! At last, I have found the shoes that have eluded me all these years.",2
LotusEater,Zero support and doesn't contour to foot.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MMG592WREORA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTL15TNB,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 15, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"It is really flat. It has zero drop and is very lightweight, but offers no support for arch or ankle. Even with an arch insole insert it doesn't feel good on my foot.",

They are exactly as advertised. It feels somewhat like bare feet, but they’re still covered from the elements. They are extremely comfortable and feel almost like slippers. Usually I’m pining to get my shoes off after work, but these shoes are so comfortable that I hardly notice them.",

This model changes everything. There are a few minor things I don’t like, but over all the best minimalist running shoe I’ve owned since Inov8 changed the 195s to be complete junk in 2010s.",
SuppingSam,"Comfortable, wider than most",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2679JX7ERHA2E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTL15TNB,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 6, 2023",,Verified Purchase,I like these shoes ! They are almost too wide for me but they lace up snuggly and make it OK. The shoelaces are like heavy parachute cord… i wish all my shoes had them. Shoes are very light and i enjoy wearing for casual and balance/agility types of work outs. Packaging was all recyclable and easy to breakdown.,

Joshua Leeger,Just buy Whitins,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GQRWQ6PX14WJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTL15TNB,"1.0 "," the United States "," August 29, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"The ultra-flat zero-drop shoe thing is now only a holdover from a fad 15 years ago. All actual development and innovation has ceased. In which case, what is the difference between a $100+ Xero or Vivo Barefoot shoe and the Whitin shoes ($45) available on Amazon? About $100+...that's all. It would be wonderful for someone to make an actual zero-drop cross-trainer - that has enough cushion to sustain 3-mile runs as well as lift and jump in...but this is not it.",
bpaine008,Highly recommend for comfort and grip.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZFC5C99WCFK6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTL15TNB,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 28, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"Went half a size larger than Xero's hiking boots and they fit great. Very comfy and soft; I don't even always wear socks with these, just slip them on. Also, on flat surfaces the grip is off the charts. So much so that when new they squeak a bit whenever you come to a stop. Just be aware that they are true barefoot shoes and have a miniscule amount of cushion and zero support - which is great for me.",

Very comfortable and light weight. I'm a big fan of minimalist footwear and this is exactly what I've been looking for. It took a few weeks to get used to, but I'm using these for casual use, running a few miles, and lifting weights.",
