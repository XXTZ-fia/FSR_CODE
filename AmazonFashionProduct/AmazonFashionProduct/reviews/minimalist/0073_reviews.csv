The fit feels great, plenty of room in the toes, they look nice, the sole is pliable. If they last for a reasonable timeframe I would definitely purchase again. My only downside I've noticed is the insole has a bit more cushion than I would like in a barefoot shoe.",

Well, these shoes are like that in a way. They make you feel the only thing between you and the pavement is a very thin material. If I were a young man I might buy this shoe again. I am not so, I need a substantial shoe to support. These shoes are not support shoes. Young feet do not need support shoes as much as old feet. There is another aspect or uniqueness to the shoe. It ""kurplops"".  Think of a clown shoe. When the clown takes a step the heel touches, then the rest of the shoe plops down. Sometimes you can hear the ""kurploping"". When you go into a dinner with friends, no one wants to be ""kurploping""! So, the shoe forces you to try to walk differently so there is no ""kurploping"". This effort detracts from a comfortable evening. Instead of enjoying your friends you are wondering if you are ""kurploping"". No. I would not buy the shoe again.",

The sole is also very rigid and stiff, despite the memory foam-like upper layer. My fake Vans have a thinner and more flexible sole than this. The sizing is also off, feeling looser which made for a painful walk with the heel part of the shoe sliding off. Feels like you’re walking in sandals with these.
