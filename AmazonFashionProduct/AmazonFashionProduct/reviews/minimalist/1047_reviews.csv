Nikki Nicole,"Cute shoes but run big.  They are nice, wide shoes.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EM7MX6BL84V5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGPPJLSY,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Size: 7 WideColor: Beige,,"My feet have grown since I got pregnant and had my daughter.  I used to wear size 5 ½ or 6, and now I am a 7 wide.  However, these shoes run a little big, so they were way too large for me.  I wish I would have gotten a size 6 or 6 ½ wide, instead.  They are cute, though!  These would be really great for someone who has really wide feet!  The price of this when I originally ordered this item was $43.99, which seems great for these shoes!",
ChaoticStray,"If You Get Your Own Insoles, These Shoes Are Perfect!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUKEEIDV19M90/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGPPJLSY,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Size: 9.5 WideColor: Black,,"I needed a new pair of tennis shoes because I have a habit of wearing shoes until they die an ugly death (souls ripped from shoe, hole grows too big to wear, sides completely worn down, etc).  Because of the increase in activity I wanted a pair of shoes that could last me a while and do an array of activities, just because I don't want to constantly be switching between pairs (the bane of my existence is shoe shopping).  I grabbed these because the advertisement stated this was an active shoe, and so far so good.I am walking in a lot of rainy weather, and one time I didn't notice a puddle and the lower half of my shoe was covered with water.  Even though the top was breathable, I didn't notice or feel any difference with the tread, which was really nice.  I am often on my feet for 6 to 8 hours and on longer days I can feel it, but shorter days it is golden.  I really like that there is more support around the ankles.  I am the type of person who can be walking in a straight line, acting fine, doing nothing crazy, and bam, my ankle is sprained.  I haven't had any issues with these and my ankles feel really supported.  I do dislike that there is barely any soul support and I will be adding Insoles to these shoes to make them a tad bit more comfy on the longer days.Even though I have a few animals, I haven't really noticed any animal fur on my shoes, nor lint, nor debris, so they are naturally good at staying clean.  I personally like to tie my shoes tightly, because it makes me less likely to trip (I trip on shadows, I am a natural klutz), and even with the amount of walking I do, I don't need to retie them during the day.  Odors don't really stick to these shoes either.  One more thing that I personally don't like is I tend to walk on my toes rather than my heels, and the noise the shoes makes me grit my teeth (it is really loud on tile floor).I do suggest these shoes if you get your own insoles![ TLDR ]------------------------------------[ ✓ ]  Ankle Support[ ✓ ]  Ties Tightly and Doesn't Come Undone[ ✓ ]  Not Prone to Slipping[ ✓ ]  Doesn't Hold Odors[ ✓ ]  Doesn't Get Dirty Easy[ ✓ ]  Good for ~ 6 Hour Days Without Inserts.[ X ]  You Need to Buy Insoles/Inserts for Comfort for the Bottom of Your Feet.[ X ]  The Shoes Make Loud Noise (Rubber on Tile)",

They’re cute on and easy to wear. The only issue I really have is that there isn’t much cushion on the soles. My arches are higher and there’s not enough support for them. Nothing an insert can’t fix, but just something to be aware of when purchasing.",
Aliiiiiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaaa,Great product,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YDF28IM57MTN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGPPJLSY,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Size: 9 WideColor: Black,,These shoes are almost as comfortable as my expensive pair of name brand.

The shape of the shoe is what makes it so comfortable, but it's also what makes it look a bit more casual. The shoe feels very washable though I haven't tried that yet. If you've ever used ""barefoot"" shoes, this has that same feeling, but there aren't separate slots for each toe. It's more like a wide mitten than a tight glove.",

I grew up in Florida and don't like wearing shoes, so I was excited to get these shoes. They are super lightweight, your toes have so much room, and you can slip them on and off easily.  I will probably replace the laces with the stretchy laces that you never have to tie/untie, but these shoes are just about perfect for me.",2
Azriel-Goddess,Very awesome wide toe shoe!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DV23MB3YD0CY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGPPJLSY,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 16, 2024",Size: 8 WideColor: Taupe,,"This STQ Wide Toe Box Barefoot Shoes for Women is really nice. The eight wide tope color is really unique as well. It almost reminds you of a teeny hint of grayish light green with cream, if that makes any sense, Lol... The wide toe area was amazing for my mother who's 78, and she's always talking about how she would like a shoe that gave her more space on the toes because a lot of the things are narrow depending on how they make shoes for certain body frames and types and so forth, but these right here hit the mark. They are made really good and have some supreme material to them as well, not to mention with the bottom sole of the shoe, had a very nice grip to the floor when she was walking in them, and they look very casual and they feel super comfy, and that is always a 10 across the board in my book. This was definitely awesome and more. Thank you..!",

These shoes are great.  They actually have lots of room for wide feet.They are super easy to slip on.  I got grey and found them stylish.  These will be my go to shoe for travel.I'll look to buy black and cream as well.The fit is good.  I'm usually between a 9 and 9 1/2. I ordered 9.5 and am happy with it.  I think the 9 would have worked too as sometimes that extra 1/2 size is to make extra toe space and these are wide enough for that.I'm super happy with these shoes.,
