Grant Weaver,Oddly Comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31IS2HYHOP3C0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGLRTDVN,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2025",Size: 9 WideColor: W85 | Army Green,Verified Purchase,"Can't get over how comfy these are. I went with my normal size, and they fit great. There is just enough padding to feel soft while also being a barefoot shoe. There is also extra padding near your heel which I think helps the comfort even more.  Can't speak on durability as I've only had them a week or so, but have worn them to work, the gym, and out and about, and they were great in both environments. I don't imagine I'll run into issues with durability, but considering the cost, you can't beat it. I've bought shoes for $$$ that lasted only a month or 2. These are already exceeding my expectations.  Have already started looking into other designs by this company to slowly replace my shoe collection with this brand.",
Shan and Zo,Cheap and Comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCHHFCOWEX2J1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGLRTDVN,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Size: 9 WideColor: W85 | Pink,Verified Purchase,"I bought these when I started a new job, as I had finally converted to the dark side (the barefoot dark side, that is). Now, I do own some leather vivo barefoots, but I didn't want to bring in my nice shoes to work. These were on sale, so I purchased them, and they were actually quite nice! They were not as wide as I would have liked, as I do have very wide feet and wearing these actually caused a bit of callousing to develop on the medial aspect of my big toe, but other than that I found these shoes to be very comfortable. If you are NOT used to wearing barefoot shoes, it is a big difference. Your foot will probably be uncomfortable at first. The more you wear them, and the stronger your foot muscles and structures become, they get more comfortable. I just wish they were wider at the toe box. But not a bad deal.",

I am so very pleased with the results.  My feet feel so good when I wear these.  I also get lots of compliments.  I'm about to order a new pair.

I do walk several miles and understand that is more than typical wear.

I got my second pair and there were no real issues at first. About a month into using the second pair the sole insert (that is not supposed to be detachable) started to slip backwards during my walk until it was 1/3 of the way down the shoe. I can reposition it to the correct spot but within a block it’s slipped again. Once this started occurring I was already outside of the return timeframe.

But I decided to try.  What a difference!  I can walk for hours in these shoes...no hip pain. And when they get dirty (they are white), I just throw them in the washing machine and let them air dry. They are the closest thing to going barefoot.  They basically just protect the bottom of your foot from cuts and scrapes. It feels like you are walking on a little foam cusion, but you can feel the ground beneath your feet.  I wish they came in more styles and colors, mostly I wish they made laceless ones.

I wanted something that was flat (zero-ish drop), not too cushy, and has plenty of room in the toebox.  They are shipped in a shrink-wrapped plastic bag. At first, I was like 🤔, but actually this is a good idea - less weight, less waste.  When I first opened them up, my first reaction was CLOWN SHOWS! 🤡 The toe boxes are big, and they look kinda goofy. But once I put them on, they really don't look silly at all - simple and sleek.  The quality is surprisingly good. The materials seem as durable as you'd expect for a pair of cheap shoes in this range, and all of the stitching seemed pretty good too.  The dealbreaker is the design. The pleather lacing side straps are pretty stiff. When I bend my foot deeply, the top of it digs right into the crease of my big toe. I already hate lunges enough, I don't need to be saying ""ouch"" because my back foot is being pinched every time I lunge!! It's possible this might soften up over time, but I could tell from wearing these for 2 minutes that it wouldn't happen before I got a big blister. So, back they go, and the search continues.",10

I did develop better patience with myself lol .. and I liked my first two pair so I bought more styles .. BUT I COULD HAVE BEEN MADE THE PURCHASE.. why do companies need a hefty report of merchandise moved in November is what I want to know .. I’ll look that up .. what’s so important about November.. or end of year spike in sales in general.. November and December.. use to only be December but November was added .. I’ll look that up .. oh but the shoes .. nothing fancy .. moderate quality sewing .. if you short on funds but want to start the barefoot shoes get these .. they are comfortable.. the 10.5 were better for my normally size 11 feet .. I bought an 11 in a different style it was to big .. but I kept them lol .. good shoe but a bit stif But buy anytime price is the same year around",

My feet hurt so bad for 3 days straight. My hips hurt and my thighs. I couldn't believe it. My Crocs were saving me from all this pain. For the past week I've been searching for a shoe alternative to my Crocs. I've heard of barefoot shoes but was always afraid to try them because of the price tag and how goofy they look. I saw a review about someone using them as a shoe alternative to Crocs and I was immediately sold. I purchased these after measuring my feet and went with a 9 wide. They fit perfectly and fit even better without the insole...which is removable. I'm super happy because my feet can spread and I know they won't be swollen at the end of the day. I love them so much I immediately purchased a gray pair. I may wear barefoot shoes for the rest of my life. They do take so getting use to. I recommend if you want to try them...ease into them. Wear some Crocs first so you can build up to it...kinda like training wheels. Then switch to barefoot shoes.

They don’t have much support as they are more of a barefoot shoe. Good quality and lightweight. I appreciate the Large toe box, So my feet aren’t constructed.",2
Georgi Lawley,Foot and heal pain gone,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WZ4ESL0FETJ5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGLRTDVN,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 20, 2024",Size: 8 WideColor: W85 | Light Blue,Verified Purchase,I'm definitely buying another pair! These immediately solved my pain in my feet. They look good too. I was alittle worried they might look like clown shoes but they don't and my toes have so much room. Love these!,
Jasmine,Best value barefoot shoe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9IALME4UKXSY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGLRTDVN,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 20, 2024",Size: 7 WideColor: W85 | Black/Gum,Verified Purchase,"Size 7 wide; usually wear a 7.5 in most brands  I bought these in Nov ‘23 and am writing this review in Sep ‘24. These shoes have been my daily wearers for over 10months and I could not be happier. Though the sole has started to crack I cannot wait to get my next pair. Barefoot shoes definitely take some getting used to but once your feet have built up their muscles you’ll never go back. I used to suffer from sever ankle pain due to various basketball injuries and after switching to these shoes not only did my ankle strengthen I no longer had chronic pain. These shoes have trekked countless miles taking trips to Puerto Rico and Alaska, could not ask for a better companion. For the price I did not expect to get a year’s worth of wear but got real fricken close. I’ve definitely abused these so a more casual wearer may get more life out of these than I have.",7
Elaina Love,Love the fit and easy on off,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FYQWRHY84B5B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGLRTDVN,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 20, 2024",Size: 9 WideColor: W85 | All Black,Verified Purchase,"The first thing I’d like to say about these shoes is how easy they are to get on and off. No need to untie, the elasticity of the shoe helps you slide it on easily by pulling the back tab. And I love the spaciousness in the toes. That’s my favorite part! When I walk my feet tend to swell and this gives them plenty of space for expansion. They look a little wide, but I don’t care how they look, it’s about how they feel. I love these shoes and would happily buy them again! And the price is right! True to size",
Caitlin Smyth,Comfy and cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R65N5VKEPNW3I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGLRTDVN,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 19, 2024",Size: 6.5 WideColor: W85 | White/Gum,Verified Purchase,These shoes were exactly as pictured. Im a physical therapist and im on my feet alot and my feet couldnt be more comfortable. 10/10 recommend.,
Elisabete Whaley,Extremely comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LAJLRM0475PC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGLRTDVN,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 19, 2024",Size: 7 WideColor: W85 | All Black,,I have left a earlier rating. Love almost everything about these shoes but unfortunately the soles do not last. I get two holes on each shoe in a hurry. I am in my fourth pair. They are fine if they are only used for work and some walking. I take 1 1/4 mile extremely brisk walk with my dogs every night and after only 3-4 trips some parts of the sole are already visibly worn. I would not mind paying more for these shoes if the soles were made with a better material.,

Got wide to ensure comfort since I tend to get the wide shoes , but seem a little “clown shoe look” At the front . My family said wouldn’t see it till I mentioned to them 😁 But what matters more to me more is the comfort 😂",
