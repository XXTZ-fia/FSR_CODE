Crimson,"Comfy, well made but not warm",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12NC5VZWT5AIY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP68GDNX,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: 14 Women/12 MenColor: Black_902,Verified Purchase,"I have become a believer in barefoot shoes.  I started in the summer with a lightweight pair and wore them everywhere, even on longer hikes with the dog, maybe 2-4 miles at a time.  My knees are too old and damaged to run so I walk every day to have some activity.  It took a while to get used to the concept but over a couple weeks I noticed fewer aches and pains in my foot and knee joints.  If you're new to minimalist footwear expect little to no padding and you WILL feel rocks, twigs etc.  Relax, you'll get used to it.  If you want cushy foam padding these are not for you.As fall turned to winter I wanted a warmer pair for my daily activities, so I bought these ""winter"" boots.  Well, winter here can range from 30 degrees to well below zero.  These boots are well made and comfortable but definitely not warm, even with quality wool socks.  They are fine for above freezing temps but anything below 20 your feet will get cold.  I would compare these to a nylon running shoe as far as warmth.So if you want a pair for ""cool"" temps these are great.  If you need true winter footwear I'd look elsewhere.  Value is 5 star but because they are advertised as winter footwear they only get 3 stars.",2

I re ordered a 1/2 size larger and they are quite a bit larger. I’m keeping them as in order to return them I have to uber to staples or ups. They will need an insole as I can feel the cold pavement on the bottom of my feet. Barefoot shoes are great for summer but not so great in winter.,

They say they’re extra big for neuropathy which I have but all they’re doing is given you a size 12 1/2 for your 10 1/2 foot.  AND.  And they gave you enough of the elastic shoe string stuff to fit an elephant.  Well, they’re not for elephants so you’ll have 2 feet of nylon string with slide plastic clamp on it left over when you got your foot in it.Like I said  They were quite odd 🫣",3

I have lighter summer shoes from this brand but needed something warmer for winter. They are lightweight but as warm as a pair of sneakers. They have good traction. I normally wear women's size 8.5 and these are true to size. They look a bit nerdy like any barefoot shoe but it's a small price to pay for the improvement in my feet. If you are not used to wearing barefoot shoes, try wearing these only indoors at first and work your way up to wearing outside for longer walks. These don't have a lot of cushion in the bottom so I would not wear them on a rocky trail but I wear them to walk on easy trails in my local parks",2
