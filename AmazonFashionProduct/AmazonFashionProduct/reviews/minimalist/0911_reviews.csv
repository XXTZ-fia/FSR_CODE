Ryan Berardelli,Nice looking earrings!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QV0VBDE709GW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWVMZ4VW,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 20, 2024",Color: Multi,,"Wife got the gold pair of these to wear to some fancier events that she needed to attend, and we both think they look great.  Material quality is good, and the gold color is very pleasing. They look quite large, but aren't actually that heavy since they're completely hollow. They do a good job of hiding the cavity in the rear since they have so much curvature. No real complaints!",

The earrings are shiny and without scratches, and the packaging was nice. The earrings are nice- I think the sizing is a bit awkward but that’s personal preference. I haven’t had them long enough to know how they hold up.",
