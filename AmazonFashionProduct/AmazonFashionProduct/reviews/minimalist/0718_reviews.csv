Andrew,"Awesome Minimalist Wallet, Super Durable, Excellent Capacity",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AJCZEYON6EWK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GB0KMVU,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2024",Color: Cyan Sailcloth,,"I received this wallet as a gift (off of a wish list I had made) for Christmas of 2023 and have been using this wallet daily for over a year at this point. I am beyond pleased with how well this has held up.  Key features I was searching for when I discovered this company was thin material (no bulk), high capacity, if needed, and durability. This wallet checks all those boxes and looks pretty rad while doing so. I carry anywhere from 8 to 12 ID's/credit cards at any given time and the thin material keeps this from being bulky in my front pocket.  After a year, there is no signs of any failure of the materials, only some slight wear that one would expect. I anticipate that I will go another year plus without issues. I thought the price point seemed a bit high when I first discovered this, but I think it is well worth it. I am contemplating purchasing a back-up, so when I eventually wear this out, I can be certain that I will have a replacement.  If you have been looking at this wallet, but just not sure, don't hesitate, I did for months (mostly because I am cheap), but I am so glad I have this in my pocket.",
