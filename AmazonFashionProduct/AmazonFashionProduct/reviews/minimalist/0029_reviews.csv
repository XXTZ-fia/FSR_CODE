I ordered the next size up, which was 41 (no 40?) and it was also difficult to get on, due to size of ankle opening, and then once on, far too large. Very disappointed.

Rachel Lyons,One of the few affordable barefoot shoes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LCEMI58RC71L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMZPR998,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 15, 2024",,,"Most of the shoes I own are barefoot shoes (no heel, flexible sole, foot shaped), and one of the challenges is finding shoes that meet that criteria and are affordable. This is my third pair of Whitin shoes, and it won't be the last.  First off, these are not the highest quality shoes. If you're looking for something closer to the other brands that run in the 100s, you will likely be disappointed. But if you like to have a variety of shoes, then this might be the right one for you.  What I like:  Comfort. These boots are comfortable and warm. I was looking for a cold weather shoe that will easly slip on, and these fit the bill.  Adjustable. With boots, I have a tendency to end up with my foot jammed up in the toe of the shoe. The hook and loop strap helps keep my foot in place. The down side is that they're slightly more challenging to slip my foot in.  Flexible. The sole flexes with my foot, and I don't feel like I'm fighting with it when I'm walking.  A note on sizing. I generally wear a size nine, but found that I really needed a half size larger with these shoes (EU 40 vs 41).  I am quite happy with these shoes, and feel they are a good value for the listed price (around $39).",

Uggs always make you feel like a blind giant stomping around destroying every thing in sight. While these shoes are wide like Uggs, they are not overly stuffed with a fleece lining. They are perfect. They are comfortable to wear all day long, and wide enough so when your feet swell you have no pain. They grip well, although some might say too well with how they squeak. The Velcro strap is more for looks than anything. Getting your foot in is kind of difficult but if you’ve ever slipped your foot into a shoe without untying you’ll be fine. It’s not too difficult. Once they’re on they are great! I love them! Got them in three different colors 🤗",8

The outer is made of nice suede-look material, the lining of wool, and the insole is faux fur. They are warm and hug the foot without being tight anywhere. These are true to size and fit well, but I am a bit disappointed in how they look on my feet. At the inner and outer sides where the separate pieces of material meet, these gap and stick out away from my ankles. I have small ankles and skinny legs which probably result in this unflattering look. The boots will still work fine for casual looks with leggings and jeans for me. For most others, these should look and feel wonderful. They are a great value.",4

Kindle Customer,best barefoot boot on the market,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZUWVHZ1RHL4U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMZPR998,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 8, 2024",Size: 8 WideColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,"So I spent many hours searching for an affordable barefoot boot that didn’t look weird and wasn’t $200+. Whitin has a chelsea boot that I ordered but just didn’t love and also the size 8 was too small. I probably need to just admit my feet are 8.5 post two pregnancies. My feet are narrow, so there is just a tad extra space in these boots but these boots have a firm upper with the strap that my foot has no chance of slipping out. I ended up ordering the 9 and love them. My toes no longer feel pinched and my splay is comfortable. The style is perfect for casual nice wear. My arches don’t hurt. and the color is so versatile. I will definitely be buying in a couple more colors. Thank you whitin for finally filling this whole in the market!!  I also have a pair of their gym shoes and love them. They have held up incredibly well and I expect these boots to do the same.",10

The soles are every bit as good quality as I would expect to get from a brick-and-mortar store, the material feels durable, and the lining is soft. As advertised, they're wide in the foot. However, despite being wide the opening is still *VERY* tight, and the adjustment strap does almost nothing to loosen them. My wife, who is a 5.5 and has relatively narrow feet, struggled to get the shoes on and off because of how tight the opening is. Once they're on, they're roomy and comfortable, but the process of getting them there is pretty fraught. They're also very true to size, and between that and the narrow opening, she basically can't wear socks with them. I would recommend to buy a half size up unless you're intending to wear them barefoot.  Overall though, they're nice and well-made. As long as you can live with their limitations, these seem like shoes that will serve you well for a good long while.",2

Boots are lovely otherwise (see end of review for a description of the loveliness).  ... I'm so disappointed in these. I was so, so excited to receive these as I've been wanting a pair of barefoot Ugg style boots that I could afford. So when I saw whitin release these, I couldn't click 'buy now' fast enough! I love my other pair of whitins so much, so I figured that I'd love these equally as much. And maybe I still will?  The problem: I should have gone with my instinct and sized up. I bought them in my ""usual"" size (38, the same size my other pair of whitins are). I was going to buy them one size larger to accommodate for thick socks for the winter, but after looking at their sizing chart for these specific boots I thought that I would have ample room. Well, I should have sized up anyway.  First things first; before I even noticed that they were smaller, I was stopped right away as I could not get my foot in the boot. I have relatively high volume feet with moderately high arches. I tried taking the insoles out, and after some tugging, I finally managed to get them on. I wasn't too impressed with that, but I figured they would soften/stretch over time so it wasn't a big deal. But then once I got my foot all the way in I noticed that I could feel the end of the boot. I decided to walk down my hallway to see if maybe my heels would slide back a bit to allow for some space between my toes and the end of the boots, but they did not. I wanted to love these boots, but I can't even wear them. I feel bad giving Whitin 3 stars, but they should be more clear on their sizing. I do understand that sizes always vary from shoe to shoe and brand to brand, but they have their sizes on these boots listed and they are incorrect.  Now I have to return them after waiting 2 weeks to recieve them and who knows how long it will take for them to get back so I can purchase another pair. 😭  Aside from the sizing issue, the boots look really nice! They've got a soft (I assume faux) suede/nubuck exterior. The interior is soft and plush, the insoles have that faux fur feel, and even without the insoles they are still soft! These boots really do look like they would be amazing in the right size. I'm kind of heartbroken with these 😅.  Side note: those with low volume feet will do better in these than those of us who have high volume feet.  If I order a new pair I will update this review.",
