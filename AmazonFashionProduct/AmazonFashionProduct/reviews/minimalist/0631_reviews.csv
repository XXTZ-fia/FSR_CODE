Golfmom,So far it is great,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LD6H4L63CZ48/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B06Y561XN6,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Color: Saffiano Sky Blue,Verified Purchase,"I just received this little wallet, it was overnight delivery which was great.  I ordered in the Saffiano Sky Blue color and it came just as pictured.  I am a bit on the fence with the wallet because I am not sure that the cash holder will hold up over time because it is plastic, and I am also a little skeptical about the mechanism that releases the cards.  Brand new it is working well, but I am going to give it a couple of weeks or so to see how well it holds up.  One other thing, 6 cards in the pop up is very tight so I chose to only put 3 cards in it and I have on the inside slots my health care card, insurance card and DL, plus 7 bills, which is all I need on a daily basis.  With this amount it closes fairly easily but I don’t think it would hold much more on the inside without bulging or being harder to snap it closed.  I will update my review if any issues arise.",

I also love how I was able to put several cards in there and my favorite pops up higher and is super easy to tap to pay. When I am using one of the other cards it is easy to push down my favorite card and find the one I need. My wallet comfortably holds my driver's license, insurance card and some emergency cash. I usually pay with my card.  I recommend buying this and as it has been months since our purchase please know the lever on the side, buttons and materials have really held up perfectly!
