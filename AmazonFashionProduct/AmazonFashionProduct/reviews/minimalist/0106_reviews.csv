I've tried Altra, Xero, Vivo, Lems, and none of them are quite wide enough. I need about 4.5 inches at the balls of my feet, and most of these brands are around 4 inches wide at that area. These Hobibear shoes fit perfectly. They are lightweight and very soft as well. The only thing I didn't care for was the memory foam insole, but I simply took them out and put in some wool felt insoles, and now they're the best barefoot shoes I've put on my feet.

I didn’t want to dive in headlong with an expensive shoe from the get go so I bought these to test drive the wide toe box. Now I never want to go back to anything but a wide toe box because of these shoes. The first time I wore them for more than a trip to the mail box was to the state fair- where I spent all day walking. By the end of the day the only pain was just the general dull ache of being on my feet for 10+ hours and even that seemed minimal compared to previous shoes. My toes had so much space to expand and breathe! Usually in the hours or the next day after being on my feet that much my feet are still sore and achy from being chafed and squeezed, but I was ready to go because I didn’t feel any discomfort. They’re lightweight and have good traction. Because they’re zero soles I could feel the ground beneath me which was sometimes strange since my history of thick-soled shoes usually meant no ground-feeling. Overall I feel it helped prevent tripping, which I’m prone to do. I’ve had them for about a month and a half and haven’t noticed any wear, which is also impressive since I wear them almost every day now.",

Almost a year later and they're still in perfect condition 👀  You can see the glue a bit between the sole and fabric, but they've been like that since day one.  They are super comfortable and have actually cleared up the pain in my feet. My toes have room to wiggle which I appreciate. Turns out sometimes the best foot support is no support?  My feet were sore the first few days after wearing them. But it was a good sore, like underutilized muscles being activated.  If you really care about style, the visible glue will be a turn off, though it's not very noticeable imo.  I wasn't expecting much from some no-brand Chinese shoes but these are really, really good. Plan on getting more colors to be able to match a little better.",2

I love to be barefoot especially when indoors but these were so comfortable when I put them on that I left them on....for HOURS...which I never do indoors.  I can't speak to how they will hold up in the long run but they seem well-constructed.  The style is so cute.  They have managed to make a wide toe box look adorable rather than clownish or frumpy.  I recently discovered the joy of zero drop/wide toe box shoes and now find anything else hurts my feet.  So I have undertaken the expensive journey of replacing all my shoes so I have been looking at a LOT of shoes in this category.  Most of them are at least triple the price of these (if not more !) and nowhere near as cute.  The size seemed exactly true.  I know Amazon is recommending they run small and are often returned but I don't know why.  For me as a normal size 8, the size 8 was perfect.  I am wondering if they are returned often because of Amazon's advise to buy bigger when that may not be needed?  Thus far I have bought zero drop/wide toe box without adding the barefoot or minimalist element so was a little worried that I may not like these.  The worry was for no reason as they seem to have plenty of padding.  As someone who goes barefoot all the time, this doesn't feel barefoot to me.  It's not ad though I am going to feel rocks under my feet.  They are just so very comfortable, stylish, and affordable.  I am thrilled !",7

Sarah in Texas,Great shoes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13PA7DP95SL2Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCC9N7DD,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 4, 2024",Size: 9 Wide Women/8 Wide MenColor: Wine Red,Verified Purchase,"These shoes feel great on my feet. They have been washed several times and still look new. I have worn them for hikes up mountains, long walks on pavement, and all around the house. They have a hundred miles on them and look like they will be around for a couple hundred more! I will be buying these again in the future, very pleased!",2
Mikey V.,Comfy but not for a full day,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XRHRRLHDZSUU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCC9N7DD,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 3, 2024",Size: 9 Wide Women/8 Wide MenColor: Black,,"I saw these shoes on TikTok and my picky feet was intrigued. I have caveman flat feet and weak ankles so shopping for shoes can be exhausting.  I have a ton of shoes I had to retire early because they’ve been causing joint pain and fatigue after a few days and weeks trying to break them in. I tried my Hobibears for the first time and they were light as a feathers and fit comfortably. I wore them to do errands and they felt okay. They felt comfy if I was just standing. I’m generally a fast walker but these make me feel like I was speed-walking on sand, but they’re still comfy. The support is weak.  I would definitely not wear these at Disneyland from open to close. I plan on taking these to a Cruise. So, for full-day use I’ll rate this 3 stars but for comfort it’s 5 stars.",
K Larson,Comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23MOFPFWIAZHS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCC9N7DD,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 3, 2024",Size: 8 Wide Women/7 Wide MenColor: White,Verified Purchase,"I love this shoe.  For this order I ordered a 7-1/2W, my normal size is 8M.  The shoes are great for quick trips to store or wearing when I won't be walking a lot.  You can feel the ground underneath (especially rocks) which eliminates them for long walks for me).  Cute and quirky!",
