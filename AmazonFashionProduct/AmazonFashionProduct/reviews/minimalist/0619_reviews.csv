I have a pair in adult women's sizes and they fit me perfectly, I wish the kids sizes did the same.

So much so that this is our second pair for our son. And this should be a 5 star review.

The previous pair didn't have the same problem. Every other part is very durable, comfortable and exactly what we wanted in a shoe for an active kid but a more durable strap secure would be the only way we would buy them again.
