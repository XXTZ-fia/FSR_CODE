Bunions run in my family, so we are doing everything we can to prevent our kids from going through the same pain for as long as possible. I really like how well made the shoes are. The soles are think enough to keep their feet safe, but thin enough to allow natural movement. The sides are also lightly padded like a regular shoe, so I don’t have to worry about my kids getting cold feet. They seem to be try to size, but keep in mind that there will be more wiggle room than the average shoe due to the wider toe box. I also appreciate how much more affordable these shoes are compared to the shoes we were getting. If they continue to hold up, we will definitely be return customers as the kids grow.",

The bigger pair we got would have been fine except the right shoe was smaller than the other by at least 1/4”. My son said it was squeezing his foot, but the other one wasn’t. When we held them up to compare them the left one was distinctly larger than the right even though they were both marked as the same size.  I have a pair of saguaro barefoot boots and so I know what a good pair should fit like and I was deeply disappointed in these. I had to return both pairs and I’m ordering saguaro!",

My kid went from “wobbly walker” to “parkour professional” overnight. They’re so lightweight, I’m convinced my child thinks he’s actually barefoot—except now he’s invincible against sticks, rocks, and whatever else he insists on stomping on.  The wide toe box is perfect for his little Fred Flintstone feet, and the grip? Let’s just say he’s outmaneuvering me in every game of chase. Bonus: they’re stylish enough that people assume I’m one of those “cool parents” who knows what they’re doing.  Five stars for durability, comfort, and making me question if I’m raising a future ninja. Would recommend to any parent who wants their kid to run faster, jump higher, and occasionally remind you how out of shape you are.",3

They seem normal but they are actually really special in that my son is more balanced when he walks/runs. I feel less worried about him rolling his ankle. They grip well onto all floor materials. The sole is very durable and waterproof and provides extra damage proof at the toes. He has no problem playing on the equipment at parks with these shoes on. They seem to be holding up well. The only thing is maybe don't wear them in the sand. My son says they look dusty now so he wears the high tops more than these. But maybe I need to clean them better. I think I they look fine though.,

We no longer walk barefoot—it's impossible in the city—but finding shoes for a child that feel natural is entirely doable!  That's why I bought the Barefoot Shoes from KUBUA. Their main feature is that they provide a zero drop, which means no difference in height between the heel and the toe. If you're not familiar with this, here's the info: shoes made with this technology promote natural walking and running.  The sneakers are very lightweight and made from durable yet breathable material. They have a velcro strap, which is essential for kids who struggle with tying shoelaces, but there are laces too—perfect for practice! The inner sole and insole are soft and also breathable. There's plenty of room for toes, and the sneakers fit like a glove. My son said they're ""comfy!""  The product page mentions that these shoes are frequently returned, but we had no issues with the size. I think the reason isn't that these shoes are bad, but rather that people either don't know their child's size or order several pairs to try on and return the ones they don't need. So don't worry and go for it if you like them.  My little boy is very active, so it's especially important for us to have shoes that allow him to run freely while giving me peace of mind.",27
