The bottom rubber hole is on the thinner side and so it allows it to be more flexible helping create some of that barefoot feeling I guess.  The style of these look good. The black is pretty much solid black and although there’s some different material materials and textures, they look pretty uniformly black from a distance.

I’m giving 4 stars because the insoles are very lacking. If these had memory foam like the hey dudes they’d be an easy 5 stars. With the insole pulled they are rock hard. Because the uppers are so comfortable I’ve purchased insoles BUT that makes these essentially a $50 dollar shoe which I think the build quality of the lower and insole don’t match.  The uppers are really nice and seem durable. It’s pretty minimalist except for padding around the upper cuff. Stitching is nice with no fray and I don’t have any concerns about durability.  Fitment is definitely catered to wide. I’m traditionally an 11.5 and these are right on the mark. The wide front toe box is a dream come true though the heel leaves a lot of extra room. Fortunately the padding around the cuff is thick enough that my heel doesn’t want to pop out when walking. Perhaps when my insoles arrive it’ll be a better fit.  I would absolutely recommend these. The bottoms are nowhere near the utter comfort of Hey Dudes but the uppers are a dream come true for wide toe boxes. If they upgraded the cushion/insoles on these they would be an easy 5 stars.

I was able to shoehorn his foot in, but there's no way he's going to wear these on the daily when they are nearly impossible to get on. I may try to carefully unpick the stitches at the tongue to see if that gives him enough room to get the shoe on more easily, but I'm not expecting much success. Disappointing, as they are nice looking shoes.",2

These shoes are perfect for such occasions. The one thing that I would caution you about though is that the manufacturer means it when the shoes are described as barefoot and minimalist. The soles/insoles of these shoes provide little padding and almost no support. With virtually no heel, you are always walking on flat feet, which might aggravate an Achilles tendon if you have foot problems. So, if you have problems with your feet, you might want to pass on these shoes. If not, then these shoes might just be the lightweight shoes that you have been dreaming of. Give them a try!",

Grammar Guru,"Still not sure exactly what a barefoot shoe is, but these seem like good ones!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1K8PWHGQJMAQ5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D91Y64N8,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 4, 2024",,,"Strangely, I like these shoes. I didn't know what to expect and ordered a pair entirely out of curiosity. So, if you're a ""barefoot shoe"" wearer, this review is not for you because you know all about what I'm a little puzzled over. For you, I'll just say this seems to me to be a fairly classy looking sneaker that is also well made.  But if, like me, you're trying to figure out if this might be worth trying, maybe I can help a little.  1. The toe box is really wide and the front of my foot feels shoeless. That was weird at first because I'm used to the traditional shoe feel. But it isn't ""floppy"" because it laces up snugly around the angle, and I am getting used to it. I like that my foot is not squeezed at all! 2. The sole is as flat as can be! That means no raised heel at all. At first, I felt like my heel was low, but it really is like standing on the floor. The fact that I have a shoe covering my foot tricks my brain, I think. Because when I kick them off, it feels the same on the floor; as a matter of fact, my flip-flops are also perfectly flat but I don't have the same sensation. That I can also get used to. 3. The best part is that while these at first felt like cheap sneakers or boat shoes, they are surprisingly comfortable. The uppers are soft and hug my feet from just in front of my angle to the back. The heel is flat but not hard and not ""moccasin"" like. It has a really nice cushioned spot right under the middle of my heel. This creates the sensation of being on a flat floor but with a spongey texture under the heel. Not sure if that makes sense, but it is the best I can do. I am an old dude with bad knees and I usually wear Sketchers because they have ridiculously soft insoles. I wear flip-flops in the house to help cushion the impact on wood floors, and these feel better than my flip-flops. Of course, not all flip-flops are the same. 4. Being barefoot involves a certain tradeoff in control. Barefoot shoes are supposed to provide natural control while giving some comfort and looking civilized (can't go out to dinner barefoot). Still the supposed control you have over your feet and your gait while barefoot does also give up control. Shoes, after all, do provide a stable platform and rotational control for the ankle primarily. These do feel like they provide a similar tradeoff--I don't feel like I'm really barefoot, but my feet move more as if they are. And so my ankles and legs operate a little more like that too, which feels funny because now I really am aware of how differently I walk with and without shoes. With these, I feel like I have shoes on but walk like I don't.  While I'm not sure I'll get used to these or end up liking them enough, I should repeat that they are a good looking and good quality shoe. If you're looking for a barefoot shoe, and you know what that means, this should be a good shoe for you. They seem like a good bet to experiment with too, if you're curious!  EDIT: I am editing before I actually post the review. I reread the product description and realized I wrote the above review not realizing I was wearing the shoes with the inserts they come with. I took them out and now I have more of that flat, hard feel I expected. I don't like that, but it definitely provides even more of the barefoot feel.",
D.L.,"A very different shoe, lacking support, runs large",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RKM6ARHSQKSB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D91Y64N8,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 3, 2024",,,"These shoes are very different than typical shoes due to the thin flat bottom, which offers no arch support.  The included paperwork suggests “starting slowly… for short distances so your foot can adjust to the “direct contact with the ground”, going on to say “Many people get sore muscles in their feet at first…”I wish I had read that prior to ordering, as I’m not interested in wearing shoes that “require your foot muscles to be rebuilt.”  It is odd, as I don’t wear shoes in the house, so I spend an enormous amount of time barefoot, so one would think having a “barefoot shoe” would not require any rebuilding of muscles.These shoes did not work for me for several reasons, first, they run large.  I normally wear a size 11 work boot and a 10.5 in a high-quality dress shoe.  As these are “wide”, I ordered a 10.5, which was too big, not just in the width, but in the length as well.  The loose fit coupled with the lack of support made for an uncomfortable shoe.  Also, due to the flexible bottom, the shoes flop when you walk, even more than flip-flops, which I found really annoying.The shoes are very lightweight, with very little structure, fashioned from a thin canvas like material.  I suppose some people may like the overall feel, I found it unpleasant.  Although, to be fair, I am very picky about my footwear and have a hard time finding shoes that fit well.

Vine Reviewer,Comfortable once you get used to it. Very Light,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D2L992386BMR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D91Y64N8,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 3, 2024",,,"At first, this shoe felt awkward as I was not used to barefoot style shoes at all. It's strange how accustomed you become to the shoes you wear. After a day or two, I really began to understand the allure behind these and why they are popular. They are very light which adds to the comfort and makes them feel more like slippers than sneakers at times.  They are very wide. Even if you typically wear W sneakers or shoes, these will be wider than you are used to, especially in the toe area. Again, this took a little time to get used to but once you do, the next time you put on regular shoes you will wonder why they feel so tight all the time.  I'm happy with them, but I probably won't wear them for prolonged walks and instead will use them more for getting around the yard/neighborhood. I'm interested to see how they feel as they break in more but for now I am happy with the results.",

They slip on and off without need of tying and untying, and they feel good all day long. They are true to size and fit like they were custom made. Finally, they look great!

The smell quickly diminished, and with socks, they felt less like water shoes. They do have a bit of a clown shoes vibe on account of the wide toe box. If you can get over them looking a little bit funny, they are pretty good minimalist shoes. I have tried a few minimalist designs before, so I knew that they would wear on my feet a little bit differently than conventional shoes, since they don't provide the same amount of support, mostly just protecting the bottoms of your feet a bit. The upper part is styled a bit like a classic wingtip sort of vibe to it, but it's somewhat understated. For around the house or for short trips, they work well. I found them fairly uncomfortable without socks, and wouldn't recommend wearing them that way.",
