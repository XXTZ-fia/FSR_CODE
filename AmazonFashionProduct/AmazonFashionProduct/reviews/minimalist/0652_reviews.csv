Minus: I'm not wild about the elastic laces with the clips. They broke the second time I wore the boots. I ordered some conventional shoe laces -- problem solved.

Now they are my go-to walking shoes. I added a molded gel heel support with arch support and topped with a full foam insole with nylon top for easy slide of feet. Now they are very comfortable. I enjoy the flexible sole and ankle hugging and room for toes, and the fact they are basically flat at barefoot walkers should be.  The lace fastener with slide mechanism makes them easy to get on and off.  Feb, 2024: At first I thought these were wonderful. They let my toes spread out and barefoot shoes were recommended by a massage therapist, so I was happy. They are well constructed, they hug my ankle for support. I started walking more in these. Now, after three months, I have sudden foot problems in both feet: a burning, sprained feeling on the lateral side of one from the baby toe to my cuboid bone, and pain at the back of my heel (achilles tendon and bursa) on the other foot. I ordered arch support insoles and after two days the lateral foot problem is easing. I'm now wearing the support insoles in slippers around the house too and hope the heel pain will subside.",2

But I have longer second toes (as do 42.2% of people). The cut of the boot slants down from the big toe. It hurts my second toes which butt up against the front of the shoe ramming the tip and nail of my toes against it and bending them. Also, the tie on the right shoe broke from the clasp first time tightening it.",2
