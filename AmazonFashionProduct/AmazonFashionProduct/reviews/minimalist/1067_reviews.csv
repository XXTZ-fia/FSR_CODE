I love how much creative freedom that threader earrings give and this is a good variety of three different lengths. I mainly use the shortest ones and the mid length ones and save the extra long ones for special occasions. I should also note that these have never tarnished at all either, though my skin chemistry has never made my silver jewelry prone to tarnishing. I've lost a couple of these over the years due to misplacment (they do not fall out of my ears) and I'll probably be ordering another set in the future. People always compliment them and they have become an integral part of my signature style. Buy a set and get creative.",2

They do not tarnish, I have been wearing my other ones day & night. This pair that I had order on Jan 2nd and arrived on Jan 5th were 3.5 inches in length but when I opened the box it was missing an earring. I contacted the company and notified them. I asked that they send 1 earring to replace the one that was missing. They wanted me to return the 1 earring so it could be replaced with a full set. Let me say, I am very handicapped and in a wheelchair and it is very difficult to go and return them. I explained that to them several times in messaging them how difficult that would be. After many conversations with the company, finally the company came though my package was delivered Feb 20th. They actually sent me a full set. I had almost given up on them because their understanding what I was trying to get across wasn't an easy task. English is not their 1st language, they even mentioned in their communications that they are not US based. For the product I give 5 stars for communications with the company I give 2 starts. So I split the difference and gave them 3 starts. The price is very reasonable for the quality you are getting, as I stated before they don't tarnish after showering and sleeping in them. I will purchase from them again as I do love their earrings, I just wish they had better quality control and better communication skills.",

I am currently wearing the longest in the set.  It's long enough to thread through all three of my piercings; which is what I wanted.  My only complaint is that the chain portion of the earring is noticeably thinner and more delicate than any of the other threader earrings I own.  As you can see in the picture, the thicker chain is more the standard I'm used to seeing.  They are pretty, but harder to see at a distance than the thicker chains.
