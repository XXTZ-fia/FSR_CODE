Hallie,Super super cute! But it definitely rubs off green.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R812SJYHDYC50/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BFDHWLVZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 22, 2021",Color: Heart,Verified Purchase,"Ultimately, very cute and you get what you pay for! The ring came in very polished and silver looking. However, I had worn it for a while and it turned my finger green where the ring was; as fake silver does. I didn't put a coat of clear nail polish over it, (like an idiot) to protect the silver.  It is adjustable, it feels like better quality than you'd expect, and it's a lovely token of promise between you and your s/o. I'd totally recommend it. I am a size 6 and had to ajust it a bit smaller, for reference. Just be sure to put a protective coat of some kind over it so it retains that nice polish and doesn't rub off green on your finger.",2
