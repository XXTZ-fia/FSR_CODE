DG,Fun! and plastic part can be removed!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34WD2TMC3QG01/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DG5ZJHBG,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Size: 9Color: White,Verified Purchase,I haven’t tested their quality in the sense of walking a lot in them but upon first look and first wear I see no defects. These are great barefoot shoes especially if you’re just starting to get into this kind of shoe and don’t want to spend much money. They are wide enough without looking dorky. Other than the little plastic thing but that can easily be cut off with some wire cutters. I didn’t like that part but didn’t want to cut the elastic string. The plastic was so soft though wire cutters worked perfect. Some ppl might not care about that but if it was holding you back it shouldn’t because it was easily remedied. I got the white ones and I’m not sure how they will hold up dirt wise but I’ve had shoes like this before I’ve been able to hand wash and hey they were $20 if they get too dirty just get another pair.,

Wide toes box, cushiony super cute. If there were more colors or if the black didn’t have the brown sole I would buy more. And at a great price",
Nessa,Love these!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BPLIZOUAFHFW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DG5ZJHBG,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 14, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I can't speak to how durable they are, as I've only been wearing them a week. However, they're very comfortable with a wide toe box, zero drop, and easy to slip on and off. For $20 you can't go wrong, I ordered a second pair.",
Smiley,Perfect,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O6CYYJXA2VH9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DG5ZJHBG,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 13, 2024",Size: 9Color: Black,Verified Purchase,I am able to walk long distances in these with no foot pain. There’s no arch support but my feet don’t seem to mind. Feels like walking barefoot on a memory foam rug.,
mp,So comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RD6QQFHKYUST/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DG5ZJHBG,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 10, 2024",Size: 7Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"I was looking for a pair of barefoot shoes to wear with jeans that were just a little nicer than sneakers but still comfy. These are it. They feel like slippers with just enough cushion, wide toe base and enough of a rubber sole to protect the foot. They fit like a glove, true to size and my feet are so happy. Plus they look really cute.",
