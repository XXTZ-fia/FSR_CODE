The bracelet is nicely made, it has strong metal clasps that snap on tightly so you won’t fear it coming apart and falling off your wrist.  While the bracelet is a beautiful piece, the sizing is way off for a normal man. At first, the bracelet was ridiculously big and could almost fit around my elbow area. I then realized I could remove part if the clasp area to make it shorter, but that also didn’t help (the picture I uploaded is after removing the extra clasp).  Another drawback is that the bracelet is very stiff, so it hangs rigid which I don’t care for.  All things considered, this is a nice bracelet with a couple drawbacks. I wouldn’t recommend.",

The next day after receiving the bracelet, when I arrived home from an appointment, I noticed the bracelet was no longer on my wrist. I was immediately disappointed, and was going to write how the clasp wasn’t reliable. When I was heading out later, it had come off in my coat.  It’s a beautiful bracelet that is a nice dark brown in color. The metal clasp is understated, which adds to the attraction of the bracelet.  4 Stars = Excellent product. A solid buy, but careful about it coming off when you least expect it. And if you have a larger wrist, it will not be easy to put on your wrist.",

The braided leather seems to be of excellent quality, and a link can be removed from the cunning clasp to reduce the size somewhat. And by the way, that clasp is so robust I had to use needle-nosed pliers several times to limber it sufficiently to unfasten it without the aid of hand tools. I like to layer bracelets, and this one is ideal for that purpose. Woven leather bracelets have been popular for a while now, and they are available at stratospheric cost from all the major designers; however, this one answers fashion's call at a very modest price, so there's no reason to spend more unless you're a label snob. And we don't know anybody like that, do we?",

The clasp does take some getting use to on how to open, but that honestly makes me think it won't open accidentally.  Comes in a nice box with a drawer. The bracelet itself is not in any plastic, but does have a gel pack to soak up any moisture during shipping (a good idea, since it's leather).

It's a quality-made tight leather braid with just enough play to be flexible, and not rigid the way 'affordable' less expensive bracelets often are. This one is listed as their 8.5""model, but one of the clasp connectors can be removed, making it very comfortable on my 7.5"" wrist.  Please see the pics for a walkthrough and explanation of the sizing.  The leather looks and feels good, and the clasps look like pewter and have good weight to them, suggesting they are not the usual lightweight hardware often used on bracelets at this price point.  It is very easy to put on, and there is a press-down 'trigger' that releases the locking mechanism to remove. One caveat: sometimes it requires a little more pressure and stronger pull to unclasp - nothing major, but worth noting.  Also, it is a nice rich brown leather - the pics don't do it justice.  Overall, is is elegant and can be worn with another bracelet without there being too much weight or busyness; definitely suitable for work and sturdy enough to hold up to some 'abuse' (gardening, other manual activities) without tearing or scratching, at least to date.  In short: if you're looking for a subtle addition to a bracelet collection that looks and feels high quality, and is adjustable, it's a definite buy!",

Cons: - Not really a con, but the clasp is very strong so it takes some effort to get it down.  Overall: The design speaks for itself, but this really is a great accessory. I take it off before showering and try not to get it wet, but so far it's help up well haven't had any issues so far.

The clasp feels solid and the whole bracelet has a nice, quality feel to it.  It's nothing fancy, but the combination of metal and leather is stylish in a somewhat understated way.

In the past I have just tied a length of jute there, and that has been fine - except in formal situations. Jute twine on the wrist does not exactly compliment a suit and tie. This ‘bracelet’ here (I hate to even call it that since that word alone seems incompatible with what a man should have on his wrist. Let’s call it a wrist rope…) is near perfect. It is not flashy at all, it has no ridiculous gold trim or shiny silver parts. Even the clasp is painted a dull black. The wrist rope comes with an extension piece for larger wrists - something that should be included in every accessory for men like this. I have been wearing it for about a week now and I love it. It’s simple and fits in just as much in a formal setting as it does a casual one. Why do I say it is “almost” perfect? Because I would prefer it in brown.

The clasp is nicely blended into the bracelet. The texture is very nice along the skin. This was a real winner and I'm looking forward to getting a great deal of enjoyment out of it.",
x8u2nite,A Braided Leather and Stainless Steel Men's Bracelet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DO5K3H4GOADI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5LNBWWN,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 3, 2024",Color: black and steelSize: L-XL,,A good looking men's bracelet - braided with leather and stainless steel. I like the simplicity of it and its best feature - the locking mechanism. There is a tiny detent you have to push/press to unlock and push-in inside (clicks in) to lock really easily.. I had a bracelet that has a magnet for locking and it always falls off when gets bumped accidentally...... and there's more - there is an extra piece and can be part of the lock if you need to wear this bracelet looser (lengthens). In my case I did not need this extra piece and it fits my wrist perfect.,

CM-CHI,Masculine looking good quality bracelet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6Z1HRAFP8D81/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5LNBWWN,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 2, 2024",Color: black and steelSize: L-XL,,"I really like this bracelet, with the black leather and stainless steel wound through it, it's very masculine and looks really good when it's being worn. The leather and the clasp have about the same level of shininess, I'd say it's somewhere between a satin and semi gloss, so the bracelet pops really well.  The clasp is nice because it has about a 1/2"" extender built into it that you can remove to shorten the bracelet. I find it's super easy to close the bracelet, but I had a bit of a hard time opening it, which I suppose the way you want it to work so it doesn't fall off easily.  Overall I recommend it, it looks really great when I'm wearing it, and comes in a really nice box that would be great for gifting. Now if I can just keep from ruining it by getting it wet!!",

It is Black with Steel braided within it.  It looks really nice on & appears to be made well, except for the actual clasp.  Unfortunately, it is made of a plastic material that isn’t easy to clasp, comes undone easier than putting on(by accident often) & also can pinch you if you aren’t careful.😣. If they would have put just as much care in the actual clasp as they did with the bracelet, it would of been great.🤷🏼‍♀️❤️‍🔥Shalom…",

B. L.,Very Nice... Size is Bigger than Expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R213RN7FT4F2PJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5LNBWWN,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 28, 2024",Color: black and steelSize: L-XL,,"This is a very nice bracelet. The woven leather and wire look classy but still casual enough to wear every day. The clasp has a solid lockup that I'm not worried about opening unexpectedly. The matte finish on the clasp is also appropriate, a shiny finish would not have been a good look for this bracelet.  After watching the Seller video about how to put it on (use a flat surface to hold it in place while you squeeze the ends together) I didn't have any trouble putting it on without any help.  My only warning to other potential buyers is that the overall length is bigger than expected. I would describe my wrist size as ""athletic"". I wear size XL gloves and don't have much/any excess bulk at my wrists. When I remove the small extension piece, the bracelet fits me just right, maybe just a touch big.... If you have bigger wrists, this would be a good choice for you. If you have small wrists/hands, this might be too big, even with the extra link taken out.  Overall a solid 5 stars from me, but be sure the size is right for you.",

The leather is stiff and tightly woven, and the clasp is painted metal (the brand name is on the inner side of the clasp, so it can't be seen while the bracelet is on). It comes nicely packaged for gifting, with a second clasp to extend the size. The smaller size is still pretty loose on a 7 inch wrist, but the expanded size is perfect for a larger (10 inch) wrist like my husband's (see my pics).  Overall, this bracelet seems durable, and does fit a large wrist as claimed in the item description. My son is happy with it, and I would order it again.",

It’s slightly adjustable in that one of the clasps can be removed, however I still found it a bit large, and it lays kind of oddly on my wrist. The clasps are difficult to open with one hand, which is why I deducted one star. Hoping the clasp gets a bit looser with time. Nice presentation in a black padded box and would make a good gift.",

After I was able to put it on, with help from my wife, I immediately love wearing this beautiful piece.. It's solid, feels elegant and premium, but unfortunately it was a little too big for me. Not enough to take off another star though. I can get used to it looking big on my wrist and is not a deal breaker. I can see a specialty store charging triple the price for it without a doubt and I don't have a problem paying the asking price here in Amazon.  I'm taking a star off because of how difficult it is to put on, but still like it enough to recommend it if you're looking to add something different to your bracelet collection or are looking for nice gift for family or friend.",

The bracelet comes installed with a ¾ inch removable link for those with a particularly large wrist.  In terms of value, at the bottom of the Amazon product page in the “Products related to this item” there are multiple similar items, some with double leather wraps, which cost about 2/3 what this bracelet sells for.  Of course it’s difficult to assess the quality of these items without having the actual item to touch and look at, but they seem pretty similar from their illustrations.",
