I found these on a list of more cost effective options, and they’re relatively cute and neutral. The toe box is very wide but really not that noticeable; however, I wear a smaller/average size, so it’s possible that it would be more pronounced in larger sized shoes (which I know bothers some people). I’ve walked a couple miles in them and have been truly impressed with the comfort and noticeable decrease in chronic pain I typically experience. I plan on updating after my upcoming Disney trip which is arguably the most intensive test I can put them through.",

I would recommend them for anyone wanting to try out barefoot shoes, but not spend a lot of money. I have a lot of biomechanical issues, and I wanted to see if wearing barefoot shoes might help. Immediately, they were comfortable on my feet and felt natural. My knees, back, and ankle already feel better wearing them. I am transitioning slowly, but have gone for a half mile walk with no problems. They do work muscles differently, but that's to be expected. I wear a 9 1/2 in most athletic shoes. These don't come in half sizes, so I went up to a size 10, and I'm glad I did. I have a thumb's width of length at the end of my longest foot, which is what I prefer. From what I have read, it's preferable to give your feet extra room in this type of shoe. I will definitely be buying more of these in different colors.",

The laces and tightening of these shoes are good. The laces hold well and the shoot feels snug to the foot. The inside heel around the shoe is padded for a nice fit as well. I think the material is a nice thick material - we will see how it holds up to washes. I wear a 7.5 to an 8, I chose an 8 due to having narrow feet. The creasing when you tighten at the top is a little bit frustrating but not a deal breaker. I think it's a decent shoe for $40. My only thing, the insole of the shoes is REALLY pretty thin/not that squishy. I don't think it'll provide much heel comfort in the long run - you'll likely have to buy more insoles. These are not waterproof.  Update, two days in - they will start to hurt your feet pretty quickly. A bit of a let down",3
