ML,Very cute but won't close properly,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RI0FO1XRNOTIT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8HNPS2X,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 18, 2023",Color: Brown,Verified Purchase,"Very cute earrings, but the clasp mechanism did not work properly. It's supposed to be closed to allow you to properly close the earring, but one was completely open. The other was clearly closed by another customer using pliers to rectify the issue, but had signs of wear and did not work properly.  It's a shame because the earrings look great. The closing mechanism wasn't configured properly making them unusable. Hope this gets sorted out.",
