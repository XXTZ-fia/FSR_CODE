I got the blue and I love the color. They're a pretty periwinkle blue. I wear a size 9.5 wide, but I measured my feet, took the advice of the size guide and went a half size up and bought the 10, hoping I wouldn't need to exchange them. They're perfect! Wiggle room for my toes, they don't hurt my broken one, and though they are cushy, I could change out the insole for one with more arch support if I need to and it will still be good. The stretchy tongue is a nice feature, it helps get a snug, comfortable fit. Also, these are light weight, and don't slip on my heel, which is a problem I have in most wide shoes that I buy.

They are very comfortable and have a soft sole and are good for running, jogging, jumping and other exercise forms. They are nice looking and will wear nicely. They are very lightweight and seem to breathe really well, even in 100+ degree temps. It is nice that they allow your foot to get air! These go well with a completely casual outfit as well as a slightly more moral, still casual outfit. Great for school or a casual work environment. Great quality and amazing product!",

I love the color and the breathable fabric the shoes are made of. I was able to put my orthotics into the sneakers without any problems. I have wide feet and I love I was able to get these in a wide width size. The wide toe box also helps with my wide feet. I think the price is reasonable for what you get. Overall, a good shoe would recommend.",

Her largest foot measured at just over 9 inches, so I followed the recommendation on the size chart and added a bit and went with the size 7 (which was 9 37/64; I’ve never seen such strange fractions in shoe measurements!).  I wish I had sized up even more, because her toe was at the very end, and she complained of it hurting her big toe.  I probably should have gotten her an 8 or 8.5.  I’m bummed, because they fit well in the width and looked nice.  She did complain that “the heel feels like it has no padding,” which I am sure is because it is a zero-drop shoe—something she is not used to.If you have wide feet and like a zero-drop shoe, this is a great choice.  Just size up a bit.",3

After wearing these all day, I can say that they are very light and comfortable, with a super flexible sole.  One thing that concerned me was on the inside of the shoes; as you can see in the photo, the upper part of the inner sole isn't glued or stitched, and seems likely to curl over with wear.  For a person with healthy legs, these are decent casual shoes. The lack of any kind of support would make them unsuitable to wear to a job that requires extended time on your feet. I'll save them for after work!",

And their grey shade makes them SO versatile - I've even started wearing them to work. I have never been this happy with a pair of shoes before.  I ordered this shoe because it said it had a ""wide toe box"". When the shoes arrived, I thought, just looking at them, that the toe box wouldn't be as roomy as I had hoped. But, I wore them to do errands today - and I kind of love them. First, they are very comfortable without socks. That made a difference with today's temp of 80 degrees - I could feel cool air coming through the uppers onto my feet. Very nice. And, my toes had plenty of wiggle room. I ordered my usual size and it was perfect. I like the extra padding at the back of the shoe. These shoes are now my go to shoes to run errands on the weekend!",

One thing I noticed, however is that they are not neutral shoes.  They actually encourage inward foot rolling, pronation, where your ankle pushes inward.  I usually wear neutral shoes as suggested by my podiatrist, but these would actually be better for someone who has a stability problem with supination.  I will still wear them around but not for heavy activity where I could risk foot problems.",

The two tone colors add a nice touch of elegance and fashion to a plain type shoe as well.  Now the only down side is the sizes seem to run very large.  They were way too big for me, but fit my mother who wears a 9 perfect.  I'd definitely recommend these shoes for looks and comfort but order a size smaller than you normally wear.",

They are exactly as pictured by the manufacturer.  Because they toe area is wider, I could order my actual size rather than a size up that would not fit my narrow heel.  The foot pad will remove if you want to machine wash and flat dry.  The colors are perfect for so many things I own.  I really like the lace up that keeps the shoe very secure on my feet.  This shoe is finally the one for me, although I normally would not wear this type of shoe.  This has been the shoe that has changed my mind.  Also, I feel the price is reasonable if not a great buy for the quality of the shoe.",

I got the ivory color because I work in a hospital and needed something neutral to go with all my zany food pun t-shirts. I do recommend getting the brighter designs for increased fun.
