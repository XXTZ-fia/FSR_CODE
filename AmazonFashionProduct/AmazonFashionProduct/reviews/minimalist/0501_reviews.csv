I like hoop earrings, and wear them almost exclusively. I was a little disappointed, because they aren't very shiny. The material already looks kind of dull, which I would expect after a few wears, not right out of the package. They don't make my ears itch, though, which is a common problem for me, so I'm super happy about that! I also liked how each pair was in its own little bag. They were pretty inexpensive, so overall a nice product for the price.",4

They are comfortable to wear and are a nice smaller hoop that hugs your earlobe and secures tightly in the back with a straight post. This is important for me because my ears seem to be sensitive to the hoops that have curved posts. I love the variety across the 5 pairs- ranging in sizes for great everyday wear. 5-star rating for overall quality and stylish look.,
