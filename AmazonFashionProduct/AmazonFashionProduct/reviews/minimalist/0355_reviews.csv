I have a vast collection of styles, and colors. I purchased the 3 Bohemia. HANDS DOWN, these are my most favorite pair! The fit, the comfort, the pattern....chef's kiss! They are super affordable but I was able to buy during a sale so, BONUS! I immediately ordered another pair of a different pattern because I was afraid I would wear the other's out. I didn't like the 2nd pair quite as much only because they were a fluffier material and looked like slippers so I couldn't wear them in public as easily. Lol. But they are just as comfortable as the others!! I'd love to get another pair. I WILL get another pair. Listen, YOU NEED THESE. Especially if you like comfy, cute, happy feet.",

The ONLY thing I didn't like is they didn't ""match"" pattern. But I realize that is going to bother me more than most.",
