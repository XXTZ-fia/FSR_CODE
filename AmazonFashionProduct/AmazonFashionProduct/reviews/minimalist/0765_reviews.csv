Dave L,Definitely Works for us!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CBD6CYR25WP6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RXSTZC,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 13, 2024",Color: Black Carbon Fiber,Verified Purchase,"My wife and I both have had these wallets about a month now, and they work for us. This wallet is perfect for running to the store and for traveling where you may not want a full-sized wallet with every credit card you own. I can keep my DL, auto club card, health insurance cards, one or two credit cards, debit card and beach pass in it. While I don’t always carry a lot of cash, it can easily fit 2 or 3 bills folded in the center section. I fold the bills into quarters and am sure to push them down into the pocket so that they don’t fall out. Overall, it’s a small minimalist wallet, and with all the cards in it’s a tight fit, perhaps if it were a little larger it would be easier to extract some of the cards. However, we’re happy with them, because both of us can carry it in our front pockets when we’re out and about. My wife doesn’t need to carry a purse all the time as this holds everything she needs for a quick store run. Can't honestly answer as to blocking RFID, but it serves the purpose well - we would definitely buy again.",

Had this wallet for like 3-4yrs now and I love it! I typically kept two cards in each of the front 2 slots and 1 card in the top back one. (Debit, Personal CC x2, Business CC, HSA CC). On the ID side, I kept my DL, car and health insurance cards. And in the center pocket, I’d either have cash (folded 3-ways) or business cards or receipts in rotation. I found this let me keep my essentials and not overstretch the wallet - and over the years, though some of the stretching set, nothing would fall out as long as I generally maintained the same number of cards, which wasn’t an issue. The wallet fit nicely in my hand and pocket (even in skinny jeans) and was quick and easy to use. It may not have all those fancy pop-out features as some of the other “minimalist” wallets, but I prefer that. I found those other wallets to be bulkier/structured and not as versatile. To top it all off, THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS SECOND TO NONE!!!!! I am a repeat customer, and re-ordered this wallet as a gift for a friend and a replacement one for myself as the wallet’s inner lining was starting to wear from normal use. Upon receiving it I noticed a card regarding lifetime warranty and feedback. So I gave them a call to provide some feedback on the one I had for years and let’s just say they took care of me! Be sure to register your product for the warranty tho! This wallet is worth every penny! And for the cost, a no-brainer! They’re also a local small business in LA which made it even sweeter for me! Support small businesses and and do yourself a favor at the same time and cop this wallet!",8

Needed to downsize my wallet and thought a slim one like this would help. Really glad I bought it not only is my back pain gone but the space saving is awesome. I like leather wallets and the metal slim wallets always make me nervous. This leather is durable and holds a lot but if your looking to minimize this is great. It takes up very little room so I can carry in any pocket. Holds everything very well. The only issue is the outter most pocket tends to have cards slide out. But they don’t fall out completely.,
