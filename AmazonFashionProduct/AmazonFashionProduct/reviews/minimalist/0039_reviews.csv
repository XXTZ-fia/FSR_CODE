I get the toes in but the back collapses and I can't lift it into place so I can slide my foot all the way in. A shoe horn doesn't help at all and adds another problem which is that the tongue recedes into the shoe when I try using the horn. It's like I need three hands. I'm so impressed that other people don't seem to have these problems. I think I'll cut out the back and use them as slides. At least my toes will be happy.,
