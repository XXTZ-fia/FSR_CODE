I got the gray patterned one. - Eyestay is made of cheap plastic. Looks cheap too - Mediocre/poor ground-feel. More sneaker-like rather than a minimalist shoe. Outsole is firm and insole is well-cushioned. Moderately comfortable. - Premium toe space. Toes splay freely. - Padded heel counter.

The soles provide little to no arch support, so if you like a flat footed shoe, these are for you. They are wide in the toe section, so your digits will have extra comfort there.

Simple, light breathable and comfortable aside from having your foot covered in fabric and little rubber it feels free and like your bare footed they weigh close to nothing when on. Love wearing them around the house. Shoes are well assembled with nice fabric and good stitchwork. Only issue I had was the way it came shrink wrapped with no box they ended up all tweaked and wrinkled with tips indented. I dislike that very much ruins the shoes shape.",
