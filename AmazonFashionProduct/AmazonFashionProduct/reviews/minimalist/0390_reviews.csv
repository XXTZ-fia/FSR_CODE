Krista Friend,Great for big feet!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P1GR8U8BJFA5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCJLF1BQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Size: 14 Wide Women/13 Wide MenColor: Dark Grey,Verified Purchase,"These are our second pair! My son has large very wide feet. Trying to find shoes he likes and are comfortable for him is a struggle every time. These shoes are perfect for him. He uses these for wrestling practice. So, he's running, stretching, sparring, doing all the high school wrestling things in these shoes. They have held up very well compared to some other more expensive brands we've bought. Most others fall apart after about 2 months of use. Mainly the glue or stitching around the sole of shoes just don't hold up to the abuse he puts them through. These shoes have been through creeks and mud, snow and ice, wrestling exercises, the washing machine, anything you can think of a 15 year old boy doing, these shoes have been through it and are 100% intact. His favorite things about them is the room his toes have and they're lightweight. My favorite part is I can throw them in the washer in a laundry bag. I absolutely recommend these to anyone with a larger, wider, flatter foot.",

Toe shoes.  I learned to hate them.  Getting them on could be a pain in the duff, over priced, they made my feet itch, running outside meant stepping on rocks, and over time, my feet hurt.  So back to regular shoes.  I liked the idea of toe shoes.  I would not say they were a total wash, but just not for me.  A couple of months back I saw a Hobibear ad on social media.  I clicked.  For the price I figured:  Why not?  I am glad I did.  They comfortable.  The bigger toe box makes me feel like I am walking in swim fins occasionally, but it works itself out.  The toe box allows my toes to stretch out, and more comfort.  I used to have to wear slippers at work because regular shoes were so uncomfortable.  Now I just wear my Hobibears.  I live in the Inter-Mountain West.  We get nasty weather.  The Hobies work well in snow and ice.
