Sean H.,"Great little wallet, folding bills is odd and not much room for cards",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DQX4DLZEJ2QR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B078K66RNC,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 31, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Black With Orange Stitching - Rfid,Verified Purchase,"I love the way this feels in the pocket; I barely feel it and I tend to keep it and my keys in the same side pocket. However, this slim size does come with some drawbacks. Having to tri-fold bills means that when I do carry cash, I notice it since each individual bill becomes 3x thicker. Get change? Now the wallet is even thinker than before. I also had some trouble finding a place for all 3 cards I carry normally, plus my license. I ended up having to use one of the cutouts in the outer layer (for the RFID blocking material) to hold the third, least-used card. Mine may be an edge case, but it would be nice if there was a way to easily hold more than 2 cards and a license.  The price was a little higher than I was planning, but I have not been disappointed with my purchase, despite the small issues I already mentioned.",

The fabric material is much sturdier than I expected and there is a clear plastic window sewn which I must have missed in the description. All the surprises were good including that is pretty easy to wipe clean with a damp cloth. I like this very compact size but I may still get the micro size so I can carry unfolded currency sometimes. Awesome ultra compact wallet!,

I especially appreciate the ease of access to the cards without the need to push a button and select from all of them. the multiple slots make finding the right card easy and quick without the prospect of mechanical failure or the need to periodically tighten screws. The slots also make it easy to stay organized; driver license in one slot, health related cards in another, debit cards in a third, and most frequently used cards right up front. The money section is great, so I can now also securely carry multiple bills without the risk of them slipping out of elastic bands or money clips. I got the nano because I seldom use cash, but I'm thinking of the larger version for international travel where bills become more important at times.",3

It’s smoothly inserts in and out. 2. The transparent ID window is rigid high density plastic, the clarity is the clearest I’ve seen.

I've had this wallet for a little over half a year, and not only is it smaller than I expected with every slot filled, it is as far as I can tell just as durable as they claim it is. I've had zero problems with it. It really fits my lifestyle of packing light and reducing wasted space.

Years ago I made the bold move to the front, and since then I've struggled to find a wallet that was compact enough to not be overly protrusive when placed in a front pocket. Now that we live in a world of ubiquitous giant smartphones, the need to reduce bulk is all the more crucial. After years of trying so-called “slim” and “magic” wallets, the SlimFold Minimalist Wallet has finally lived up to those claims. It's pricey for a non-leather wallet, but it feels sturdy, holds all of my cards, and is compact enough to fit into my fifth pockets, even the smaller ones in my khaki/chino-style pants and shorts. As a result, my wallet leg doesn't look strangely bulky. This leaves my phone pocket a little lopsided, sort of a “half Torgo” look, if you will. Still better than the prior alternatives. Maybe next year we'll have flat foldable/rollable phones that conform to the shape of my other leg or fit in this wallet! 🙏",

I regularly carry 8-10 cards and 2-4 tri-folded bills which the Nano keeps small and compact. The soft shell material gains all the necessary structures once cards are added but remains almost unnoticeable in front, back and even breast pockets.  The design is simple but thoughtful, making access easy and convenient. I'm curious how long it will last but the 5 year warranty makes that less of a concern.  Don't over pay for an over engineered minimalist wallet. Keep it simple, keep it Slimfold!",

I used to have a large, thick Costanza wallet, and decided I wanted something smaller. I bought and used a few small, thin, ""minimalist"" ones, and while they were pretty thin, they had problems. Despite being thin, they seemed like they could be thinner. They were also kind of long or tall relative to their contents. But most of all, they usually fell apart after a short time, with threads and edges fraying and separating.  I then saw this. Much thinner and even smaller than the other ones, but much more expensive, and not leather - just some stretchy cloth material? I was hesitant to buy, but I decided to go for it.  In the few months I have been using it so far, it was worth every penny. It is small. Very small. But not too small. All my cards fit in it great, plus a bill or two. The material it's made out of seems to stretch when you open or close it, but always returns to it's form with no visible permanent deformation. But really, the thing is that this thing is just so dang LIGHT and TINY. I can barely tell it's in my pocket. And yet it still somehow fits everything inside that I need it to. I can see it being a problem if you carry lots of cash, but if you usually just carry a few cards, etc, this is an amazing wallet. I will be using it for quite some time. So far I don't have any durability or quality concerns - it looks as good as the day I bought it. If you are on the fence on this wallet due to the price, in my experience it was worth every penny, and I suggest you buy this wallet.",

I ended up purchasing this slim fold which is a little pricey.  After trying it out for a few days I continued to carry it.  Now it is not just for my trip, it is my everyday wallet.  I don't carry that many bills, 2-20's, a 5 and 3- 1's.  These days that's plenty of cash.  Some reviews say you have to fold the bills three times so they fit.  This is not true at all.

And I'm not exactly gentle on it - I've crammed it with too much stuff at times, throw it in my gym bag, toss it on the dash, etc.  It holds a perfect amount for a minimalist+ wallet. I also very much like the card slot design. When the wallet is closed, it is impossible for any cards to slide out. This is unlike many other designs, where the cards slide in from the top or in from the edges. I never have to worry about things popping out if I drop my wallet. To me, this wallet has the ideal design.  I also like that it doesn't have a big brand logo on the outside. The small ""slim fold"" logo is inside the wallet and not very big at all.",2

This is not meant to carry cash without having to fold it. If you want that option, get the larger sizes such as the micro for US currency. Docking points for this is ridiculous as the nano size was specifically designed this way.  This is a very company wallet that actually has very useful compartments. That was the main problem with other minimalist wallets, everything is clumped together and having to search for the right card (if isn't the most used ones on the edges) is a huge pain. There are 7 compartments: front left with clear ID, front right has 2 card slots, back left, back right, and then middle left and middle right. I put my tri folded cash in the back compartment so it is secure. The RFID does feel a little cheap as it is just a thin piece of material (kind of feels like laminated cardboard) inside the back portion. You could probably take it out (most likely have to bend it though due to the stitching) if you decide that you don't want the RFID for whatever reason. The material seems tough and black on black is a great color scheme. This is the slimmest minimalist wallet as other ones that use leather, elastic bands, or metal are much thicker. The main reason I tried this was that everything is easily accessible but still very compact. The Secrid wallet still had everything readily accessible, but was much larger in size due to the leather and the metal used. Trove was thicker due to the leather and also the cards at the edges get slightly bent outward in the middle. Nomatic is surprsingly bulky and terrible for carrying even a few bills due to cash having to be quad folded. Both the Trove and Nomatic design expose the edge of the cards (the Nomatic was much worse though) and will cause damage over time. I used the Trove for a year with some visible damage but only a week on the Nomatic and I had to get a replacement card for the two on the ends. Both of these 2 designs also clump a lot of cards together in the center, making it difficult to pick out the you need (Trove was worse for this). Another one I tried was iPulse. This was fairly cheap and advertised as full grain leather with RFID. It works fairly well but again, lacked different compartments. It only has one large central compartment with a smaller side compartment that only fit cash (tri fold).  I bought directly from the manufacturer since they had a promotion but the free shipping was extremely fast. I will be using this for a long time as long as durability isn't an issue.",3

Rather, you must tri-fold them, and insert them into a 1/2 section.  I thought I’d return it, but I had no time to find a replacement, so I just committed to it for the trip.The wallet held up very well on the trip.  It got both wet and muddy, and bounced back well.  I’ve also learned to enjoy its extremely low profile.  In fact, I have yet to move back to my leather wallet, even though the trip is over.  I will eventually.... just no rush to do so.Overall, I’d give it high marks for an adventure wallet or extremely slim-line wallet for dress pants.  That said, I still believe it should be about 20% cheaper.  Hence, 4 stars.",12

I reread the description and it says that money only fits if you fold it multiple times. I don't know why a person would want to trifold their money to make it fit a bifold wallet. But I've been using it anyway. One upside is that this stupid wallet is inherently funny, it overflows with any amount of money put into it. I get lots of laughs at the checkout.",3

Loved it a lot. When I heard the nano came out and it was even smaller than the micro, I had to give it a try. The idea of the nano is well executable. Same great wallet as the micro but its just not suitable for me. Often times I don't carry around cash but I do slip in receipts and business cards, that is where the problem comes. The wallet bulges out and looks fat compared to the micro with the same contents. I had 7 cards in there and 2 receipts folded once. If you purely only carry cards, this might be the one for you but if you plan on carrying anything more than cards, the micro will serve you better.",3

I've always enjoyed a minimalist wallet and this gets it all done.  No more leather to get damp or ruin card mag strips.  RFID protection, now needed for chip cards, is out of sight and mind.  So much detailed thought has gone into the design and making of this fine bit of technical art.  And the fantastic company support during my selection and after, as they solicited my feedback, is inspirational in these times.Grab one, fill it with your vitals and enjoy the freedom the quality minimalism brings.",

This is the 4th or 5th Slim Fold wallet I've owned and the Nano is probably my favorite but I've really liked each one of them. I'm a front-pocket wallet carrier and what I like best about the Slim Fold is how thin it is and how unobtrusive it is in my pocket.",

The Nano I recently purchased is my first one in the newer material (sorry I can't recall the name of it off the top of my head). I can already tell from just a couple months of use that this one will last significantly longer than the Tyvek, and I was pleasantly surprised by how little extra size and weight the different material adds to the wallet. The size is also perfect for my needs. I have loved how thin the micro wallets were, and how they were sized perfectly to my needs, but I also rarely carry any cash, so the new Nano size is an even better fit. It is the ultimate front pocket wallet. To the point that I sometimes get worried I forgot it, then realize it's definitely in my pocket, I just couldn't feel it. I am completely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recomend this wallet (and in fact already have a couple times) to anyone looking to slim down their wallet situation.",3
