I first discovered crevice brushes a couple of years back. It's such a simple device I’m almost surprised I hadn’t noticed them before.  These things are great for getting into tight corners and gleaning grout and caulk around sinks and bathtubs etc. I use them at home and also in my role as a property manager and prepper.  This particular brand has a nice contoured gripping handle and the brush bristle is reassuringly tough for tackling difficult jobs. The brush blade is fitted tightly into the handle and I can’t imagine the two parts separating in any but the most extreme conditions.  These are a good quality and I have no hesitation in recommending them.",
Mr. Wilson,These are perfect!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZY86ZY3JK9GZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2HX2NS4,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 9, 2024",,,"These grout cleaning brushes are designed really well. Between the handle and the curvature of the brush, this product lends itself to success!  I used to be employed by simply cleaning dirty grout. That was my job a long time ago. So, I do have some experience at this.  This product shines in the floor to wall joints, the corners, and basically anywhere a flat bristle brush can't get to. The fixtures included.  The bristles are stiff enough to get the job done. The key is to use a good cleaning product per directions, give it some time to soak and work in, then use this brush lightly and for some time. Heavy pressure doesn't' always work. Heavy pressure will just ruin the tool most times.  Hope this helps. 5-stars!!",

Living Rural,"It's fit for my purpose, cleaning the gap between tiles before grouting",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29UVHEF0K35E8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2HX2NS4,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 5, 2024",,,"An embarrassingly long time ago, I put down some tile and did not grout it right away, life kind of got in the way. But now, there is dog fur and other things in the crack that needs to be removed before grouting.  The gaps I used for grout were 3/16 of an inch. The brush fits and does a good job loosening the curd at the bottom so I can pull it up with a shop vac. Not sure if they would fit a smaller gap. Bristles are 5/8 inch long so it's fine for what I am doing.  The handles are large enough to get a grip. The body is curved so you do not bust knuckles. I am sure I will wear out the tip before the rest of the brush body, but it looks like I adjust the bend to fit my specific needs.  The bristles are crimped into a metal channel, none have fallen out for me so far.  It's not pretty, but it's a good product for my needs",

Bob in Boston,Good for grout and bathroom and kitchen faucets.  But grills and toilets?  NO!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VERJVOS9QEZ3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2HX2NS4,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2024",,,"These brushes work well for certain uses.They work well to clean the grout in my shower.  They work well to clean the edge where my sink meets the backsplash in both the bathroom and the kitchen.  These brushes work well on the soap scum that builds up around the faucets in the bathroom and the kitchen. (Glad there are three to the set, so the kitchen and the bathrooms each get their own brushes).Why not stop there, and say “job well done”?  Message to the seller:  You had a set of important uses and you did them well.  Why try to stretch too far and say it is a grill brush too – NO.  It is awful for cleaning a grill.  I wouldn’t want stiffer bristles to clean the grout or the soap scum on the faucets, but these bristles are not nearly stiff enough to clean the grill or the toilet.So I give it four stars – five for what it does on the grout and the sink, and two for what it doesn’t do on the grill and the toilet.",

We stopped our house cleaning service during Covid so I am now responsible for cleaning the hard to reach areas in the kitchen and bathroom (self determined responsibility). I was using sponges for these areas but they did not do a good job. The KMOSENIA Grout Cleaning Brushes are perfect  Three brushes come in the set - 2 black and 1 white. I could not see any differentiation in the texture of the brushes - only difference I could see is the color of the handle. The handles are comfortable to hold when brushing with force. That is important to provide the necessary pressure on the brush end.  I use the white handled brush for the kitchen and keep one black handled brushes for the bathrooms. They are great for cleaning around faucets (back of faucets are almost impossible to clean with a sponge).  For the kitchen, they are great for cleaning around the stove and the interface with the sink and counter. I also just used a brush to clean the air conditioner return vent that was very dusty (I used the brush in combination with a vacuum cleaner so the dust and dirt was removed).  I did not realize the value of having these little brushes to help clean around our home, but they are great to use, well made, sturdy and have a hole to hang up on a hook (if desired).  I recommend them.",

One nice thing is that you do get three brushes.  The biggest pro I found is just the fact that you get a quantity of 3. So at least it’s not just one brush.
