Corrigan,100% -NOT- for trails.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OU9LXGY2CQAH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4CN1S9Y,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: 10Color: Multi-black,,"I’ll say that walking on flat, dry ground is okay. However, if your feet get wet they slip around too much. Even dry, there is no rigid structure to this sandal, your feet slide all over the place; especially when going up or down slopes. So you absolutely can’t go hiking. You cannot tighten the backstrap without having a lot of excess strap dangling, and you cannot tighten the front portion without squeezing your toes together (the opposite concept of barefoot footwear). It’s a pretty terrible design. I’m glad I bought these at a discounted price, but even then paid too much.",

They are definitely zero-drop and have an awesome tread on the bottom.That being said, $90 is WAYY too much to charge for what you get here, regardless.

I have bunions and this is a good summer shoe for that. The sole is very sturdy and grippy on the bottom and my feet do not slide at all in the sandal. I wear them to work in a casual office, in the garden, mowing, walking, and moderate hiking. I probably would not wear them to Church. I did not post a picture because my feet are a bit narly.

Since then, I've been on a journey of feeling new sensations and strength in my feet. - My toes are stronger and more active in the step.

It's concerning to see the sole detaching so early on, making me doubt it'll even last 1000 miles (since I don't walk much).  For everyday wear, they're great - true to their zero-drop design and perfect for hot climates (above 90°F).

We had a chance to test them out on a 30 mile hike last October and I am satisfied with my purchase. They are extremely light which helps to keep my load weight down, but gives me something to wear around camp and let my feet air out after being crammed in boots all day. The straps setup keeps them snugly attached to your feet which also lend to them being used as steam crossing shoes if the water is too deep for your boots.  As far as the 0 Drop hype goes - I don't know whether it is a good thing or not, but you can definitely feel it. Its about as close to barefoot as I have ever felt while still wearing shoes. A little weird at first, but I found them quite comfortable trudging around camp at night.  My only complaint would be that the strap setup makes them a little fidgety to put on. Putting them on when nature called in the middle of the night was a little challenging - Especially being that everything on my body was super-sore on that trip. I feel like this could be improved by adding an additional buckle or maybe changing the strap design a little, but I'm nitpicking here.  They are however expensive, so if they fall apart before I feel like I've gotten my monies worth out of them and Xero doesn't live up to their warranty, the rating will be adjusted accordingly.",5

They also weigh practically nothing and take up almost no space in a bag.  When can we get flip-flops like this?My one qualm is that the design makes it slightly more challenging to get your feet in and out quickly, versus something with Velcro or other fasteners.  But, by the same token, they’re not going anywhere once they’re adjusted properly.  It makes sense, though, considering the design goals of minimalism and light weight.They’re definitely a different experience from thicker sandals with more cushion and support.  The “barefoot” term is accurate - it feels like you’re wearing nothing.  But there’s still some minimal shock absorption, and the grip is very good.  You feel more “in control” then you do with thicker sandals.",

I read some articles about zero drop barefoot sandals and decided to give them a go. After 2 weeks research I decided to try the Xero Z trail, especially since they backed their product enough to offer a 7 day trial period. I got them in, easily adjusted them to my feet and hit the trail. I immediately feel in love with them. I kept looking at my feet to ensure I actually had sandals on. They  are that light and comfortable!  The open toe design enhances the barefoot feel with no strap between your toes. I thought the front toe area might catch on rocks or roots on the trail but with a proper snug strap adjustment,  there's No issue. During the trail period I took the Zs to water. They did great with the only exception was if water is between the skin of the feet and sandal bed. It Can be Sleppery!  Did not like that part. However,  they dry quickly. Overall I was so impressed that I ordered a pair for my wife. She loves them as well. A suggestion I found to imprint your foot into the foot bed is to shower in them a time or two. After doing this you could clearly see and feel the glove like comfort. My only concern is durability. I read reviews with strap issues including the backstrap velcro. During the trial period I called Xero customer service. They eased my mind when they assured me if that should happen,  the sandals were covered with a 24 month warranty on the straps and a lifetime warranty on the soles. Therefore,  if you enjoy being barefoot and grounding but with a little protection,  I HIGHLY  recommend these Xero sandals!",9

If you’re looking for a quality, active, zero drop sandal, spend more and get something like the Bedrock cairn (or cairn pro) sandals.

They are not overly bulky like many sandals are. I usually wear a mens size 10, but I got size 8 because I wanted them to be snug with the edges of my feet pretty much aligned with the edges of the sandals.  Cons: The first time I used these sandals it was for a 2 mile walk on pavement. My feet got very hot (burning hot) at the friction points and i had to put my feet in front of a sprinkler. Because of this I use my sandals for activities where I'm not constantly walking (eg. going to the store). They were also painful to wear initially, but after I put forth some effort to dial-in the tightness, I don't think about them much when I'm wearing them. The pictured sandals were purchased 2 months ago. The insoles of my wife's sandals (green/grey) already started to show wear less than 2 weeks after purchasing. She does like them, however, and uses them more than I do (eg for walks and short hikes). I am worried that the rubber piece next to the pinky toe will break off, but I can see how they had to compromise to create this minimalist sandal. Also maybe I just haven't figured it out yet, but they take a minute to get on and off.  Bottom line: I love what Xero Shoes is trying to achieve and at this point a can say that I would buy Xero Shoes again because I like they're design and I am hopeful that they will work on durability for subsequent models.",

Not quick to put on, and I’m not a fan of the single adjustable strap that goes from the toes to the top of the foot. Separate Velcro on either area would have been better, in my opinion. Not wide enough either…had to to size up but it didn’t pan out well. My feel are used to the barefoot concept but the straps, width, etc., are just not for me. Stuck with these, out a pretty penny and will eventually have to find something else. Glad it’s winter for now.",

I currently live in an environment where I can wear sandals all year round, so I wanted the minimalist type. So far these things are amazing. They are extremely lightweight, but they keep me from feeling the sharp things while walking on the dirt roads. They're comfortable enough if you are used to minimalist footwear...for me its been a while, so i need to get used to it again. But so far so good... I wear a 10.5 so i ordered an 11. They fit just fine.  Update: after a few weeks of daily wear, one of the straps broke on the inside of the sandal. I was able to get repaired by a local shoe repair man and so far that repair is holding up. The repair man beefed up the attach points so I hope they hold together. I still do really love these shoes",5

I wanted something without padding or arches- they hurt my feet. I also wanted something to hike in, the soles of Tevas and Keens hurt my feet. I read the reviews and decided to give them a try. From the moment I out them on I was in love, exactly what I wanted. 1st know the bottoms are thin, it will be like walking without a shoe- so if its a rocky terrain you will feel it. You foot will also feel the hard concrete so make sure thats want you want. 2nd I agree with other reviews the durability is not there. By the end of the summer season the inside of the sandal was worn down and gone. For the money I would have liked to get two seasons, but they were worn almost daily. I will consider another pair next year.",3
