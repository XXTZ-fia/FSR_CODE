That would take away the barefoot quality. And be painful in my opinion. However I did add a thin wool insert for winter. I wear a womens size 8 in most shoes and ordered an 8 in this brand.

Linda,"Before you buy, look very carefully at the inside of the heels in the photos!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QFO5O3S5FZ2A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D59P5T4X,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 5, 2024",Size: 8Color: Nude,Verified Purchase,"Stars were deducted for not making the shoes identical except for the color and for not mentioning that information in the description  I ordered these shoes (gray 39) because of the wide, square toe box. I was really excited when I put them on. My feet hadn't felt that good in shoes in years. The wide toe box isn't just wide, it is actually the shape of my foot.  I was so happy that I purchased a pair in nude. Unfortunately, those shoes slipped off my heels - badly - even with both inserts, even with replacing the insoles with gel inserts and playing around with adding the insoles that came with the shoes. (I highly recommend gel insoles if you are on your feet a lot.)  I compared the heel lining of the grey to the heel lining of the nude pair and discovered that there are two styles of shoe. At first glance, all of the shoes look identical in the photos. There is nothing in the description to indicate there are two styles, and they don't fit the same way.  The heel padding on the nude is located lower on the heel of the shoe and has thicker padding. Unfortunately, the padding is too low to catch onto my heel, so the shoes slip off when I walk. To be fair, I ordered size 8 instead of 7 1/2 because they don't come in 7 1/2. Having less shoe length might have pushed my foot back far enough to keep my heel from slipping.  That being said, the heel on the gray fit me just fine. The heel pads on those shoes are higher up on the back of the shoes and catch my heels so they don't slip out.  Before you buy these shoes: look closely at the photos. If the size label (located in the heel of the shoe) in the photo is showing completely, the heel pad is higher up on the heel of the shoe. If the label is partially obscured, the heel pad is thicker and lower.  These colors have the higher heel pad: beige, black, both grey colors, white, green and navy.  Bottom line: great shoes if you need a square toe box, made more comfortable with a gel insole; be mindful of the heel pad placement.",7

Unfortunately the gray color way in this shoe is not well represented on Amazon. It’s a much lighter silver with a distinct blue cast in all indoor lighting. It’s sunny here so I don’t know what they would lookout outdoors on a cloudy day but I imagine the blue tone would be emphasized. In the outdoor sun, they are more silver than gray. There’s a sheen to the material, so that comes into play with the color appearance. I like the sheen, but I really need the relatively darker gray that’s pictured in the Amazon description. It’s such a bummer because I otherwise LOVE them and they check all the other boxes for me. The top of the outsole comes far enough back on my foot to come past my bunion and not cut across it, which I wouldn’t be able to tolerate. Yet it’s still low cut enough to have a flattering, relatively dressier, or at least business shoe shape. I need them for a 2-day conference/event I’m attending with lots of walking. The shoe material is stretchy but supportive, there’s a nice cushion at the top of the heel, the sole is completely flat and flexible and appropriately thin for barefoot enthusiasts. I absolutely love my other Whitins (sneakers). They’ve been a total lifesaver for my extra wide toe box, narrow heel feet, with a bunion on the left big toe. I took out the insoles and cut my own from 100% wool to my custom foot size and shape and the shoes accommodate them. Even tho the color of these flats are not perfect for me, I will be keeping them due to the combination of all the barefoot factors, comfort, and style. Great value for the money.",27
