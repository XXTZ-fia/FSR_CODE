Giving 4 stars because wearing these can be dangerous. The sole has absolutely zero grip on any wet floor/surface, feels like walking on ice. Luckily for me I live where we don't get a lot of rain so I haven't slipped yet, but I do have to be super careful. I bought my usual size 6, but it's a little loose.

I'm 8.5 with narrow feet and high arches. Nothing fits... I mean nothing, w/o extra inserts, whatever. I buy shoes and other ugly sneaker types and the occasional decent looking odd boot/shoe that miraculously don't kill my feet in 2 days, and put in some great soft liners that have helped me for a few years. (get those here btw... if you suffer from PT you know what I'm talking about.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D5Y9RWQ/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_4?smid=AORVBCIW4J0PV&psc=1 The liners are a silly bright yellow and blue but they are also in grey... about $1 more. Thankful for them no matter what they look like, because I can't walk in anything w/o them, so I buy shoes/boots a half size larger (9) and that works just fine.  So... back to THESE shoes. I fully expected to have to send them back like most stuff I buy for my little princess twinkle toes ... but from the moment I put them on with the inserts (socks were those knee high thin compression things) - I have only taken them off to sleep! Well yeah, shower.... but I barely even know I'm wearing them. Only one other pair of shoes has been almost this good and Clark doesn't make them anymore. :( Pity. But these guys are amazing for flexibility but still offering support. Love the knubs on the bottom for secure footing. (lol not the best for dancing, so you'll just have to lift up your feet) ;)  Anyway, the years of PF that I managed to mostly eradicate a few months ago came back the other day with a vengeance. IDK, some pair of padded sandals did that, that I bought from Beall's and had to return. So I went back to using the astym tool, etc. to work out what was going on. (Look that up... you need that if you have PF.) But I put these KBZone shoes on and wham... nothing... nada... zip. Pain free. Buying at least another pair. Wish I could find some nice, sharp looking pair of boots or shoes that fit like this and don't actually look like a fat Platypus tail but hey IDC... they do the job. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. :D",9

These are definitely shoes with just enough stretch to hug the feet but not so much as to be more sock than shoe. Yet the material is thick and seems tough enough for everyday wear. I am sure that the more inconspicuous colors of these could be worn in a business casual setting without eyebrows being raised, especially those with a dark sole. I’ve worn the pair I have for a couple of days and the only thing about these that I will be fixing is the inserts. The ones they come with are a little too foam-like and they feel like they’re sticking to my feet, nearly coming out when I take the shoes off. Foot powder helps but I will be getter better inserts, and this why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. Overall I love these and have come back for more.",
