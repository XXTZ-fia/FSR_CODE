Angela,Very cute design,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUELORH99EKF9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6PMK65H,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Color: Black,,"I actually really like these, the design of the frames and their shape are really unique and very stylish. The included sunglass case is surprisingly nice as well, very chic and very protective. I will say that these feel very ""cheap"" to the touch though, they are very light weight plastic and are not at all durable. These are well priced for the quality they are though, they are likely to last only one season of wear but at this price point, thats more than ok.",

JJ,"Very lightweight, polarized sunglasses",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U5KOV1RY3I3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6PMK65H,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Color: Black,,"I can't believe how lightweight these are. It makes me wonder if all the other ones I have are heavy, or if these are just super light. They're not too dark, not too big. Universally flattering shape. They're just right.  Comes in a giftable box with a little black clutch to hold your sunglasses. Highly recommend this brand/style.",2
Seonghwan Lee,Stylish Protection: LUMILUNI Sunglasses Exceed Expectations,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2J44Q78MY1C3Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6PMK65H,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Color: Brown,Verified Purchase,"I'm thrilled to share my experience with the LUMILUNI sunglasses I recently purchased! Here's my review:  ## Packaging and Accessories  The sunglasses arrived in a beautifully designed package that immediately caught my eye. Upon opening, I was impressed by the high-quality pouch included, which adds a touch of luxury to the overall product.  ## Product Accuracy and Quality  I'm pleased to report that the sunglasses look exactly like the images on the product page. The craftsmanship is impeccable, with a clean and sleek design that exceeded my expectations.  ## Durability and Flexibility  One of the standout features of these sunglasses is their incredible flexibility. I was amazed to find that I could bend them in various directions without any risk of breaking. This durability gives me confidence in their longevity and makes them perfect for active lifestyles.  ## Versatility  What I love most about these sunglasses is their unisex design. My wife and I plan to share them, as they look great on both of us. It's like getting two pairs for the price of one!  ## Overall Satisfaction  I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. The combination of style, quality, and durability makes these Amazon sunglasses an excellent value. I'm already considering buying another pair in the future.  In conclusion, if you're in the market for a reliable, stylish, and versatile pair of sunglasses, I highly recommend giving these a try. You won't be disappointed!",3
HMB,Cute but cheap,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KKU6J0GUXJVN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6PMK65H,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Color: Black,,"These glasses look great, but feel awfully cheap. They are super light, so very comfortable in that you barely feel them. The description says you can ""open and close ... with a feather-light touch"" but the hinges are actually very stiff and hard to open and close, and since the glasses feel so delicate, I worry they are going to break. The ""nonslip tips"" are just grooves in the plastic -- when I put them on, the grooves make a kind of ""zzzzzip"" sound against my scalp. The photo description says ""gentle nosepad"" but the writtten description says ""adjustable nose pads"" -- they are NOT adjustable; the nose pads are part of the frame, but I find them comfortable. The glasses fit me well, so I don't think they will slide down my nose when I sweat. The faux leather case looks cheap and plasticky but it protects the glasses well. The polishing cloth is 14x17cm. The box the glasses and case come in is quite nice -- suitable for gifting. I really like the way these glasses look but I'm glad they are inexpensive, because I'm afraid they are not going to last long -- the way the hinges are so hard to open it feels like I'm going to end up snapping the frame in two at some point. But the glasses are cute while they last!",

Super light weight, fits perfectly without putting too much pressure on my head, and love the good quality glass case. Also recommended to friends and family!",
David K.,Great sunglasses,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39PGP4DZ0FYGT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6PMK65H,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Color: Brown,Verified Purchase,"I purchased a pair of sunglasses in brown, and I am very satisfied with them.  First, the quality exceeded my expectations, especially considering the price. The sunglasses were extremely comfortable to wear. The included sunglasses case was stylish, which I really liked, and the sunglasses themselves had a design that suits various face shapes and sizes well.  If you're looking for sunglasses you can use comfortably without worrying about them getting damaged, I highly recommend these!",
