Can't believe I have more room in something half the size and bulk. Really the only difference is I have to use a clip on the wallet now for cash instead of putting it in a wallet slot. I hope it holds up, it supposedly has a lifetime warranty. The only concern I really have is the half that has the drivers license is kind of floppy with a thin piece of material holding the two halves together. Really like it so far, and fits great in the front pocket. It comes with a screwdriver which I don't really understand, it is not needed to do anything unless it is to take it apart if the credit cards get stuck and don't pop out.",

My previous wallet (pictured in Brown) worked well, but it was a little too bulky. I saw the Umoven minimalist style and had to try it out. Having used it for the past couple of months, I can confidently say that this wallet meets my needs better than any other wallet I’ve owned. I often see advertisements from Wallet companies that charge 2 to 3 times this amount, but I can’t imagine any of them could exceed the bang-for-buck aspect of the Umoven. Here are a few things that I love about this wallet: it’s a smaller size, the AirTag secures very well, the amazing credit card slide feature, RFID protection, a built-in magnet that keeps it from flipping open, a convenient money clip, the sturdiness and build quality, and the amount of credit cards it holds. This is a terrific buy and I’d recommend this to anyone searching for a quality wallet without exaggerated pricing.",

That said, I do appreciate the subtle carbon fiber pattern, it's not as noticeable compared to other products. The exterior pockets are all a bit snug which makes putting a card in, but I don't travel with many cards. I like being able to remove the inner cash clip (I put the screws back in to fill the holes) since the flat space is great for me to place sticky notes written throughout the week. It's about the same weight as my phone once full and an airtag set up, which is definitely heavier than my last wallet, but it's a lot more solid.  One thing I don't like is that the snugness of the pockets, including the inner one with the lever to push the cards up, don't work that well for non-laminated cards. However, there's a workaround for the main card slots by sandwiching the paper card between plastic cards. That helps it not get stuck.",

The only flaw is that the magnets meant to hold the flap attached is weak so I corrected the problem by cleaning the surface with alcohol and attaching small velcro dots that I cut into halfmoon shapes.
