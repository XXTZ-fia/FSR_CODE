Samantha Grimm,I have bought EIGHT (yes 8!!) pairs bc I love them sm but the stones fall out within a week,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3540HRLK5AE7Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CS6RPGC,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 20, 2024",Material Type: Yellow GoldStyle: Round CZ,Verified Purchase,"These are my absolute favorite earrings. Unfortunately I have had to buy 8!! Pairs of them in the last year and a half because within a month the stones start to fall out in them. I have tried silver and gold, in both designs. I was hoping maybe if I switched to a different metal, maybe my problem would be solved. Unfortunately nope. I know it seems ridiculous that I have bought these so many times with it being a faulty product. But I absolutely adore the way these look in my ears and it’s just super disappointing that they are such poor quality. Not to mention I’ve probably send 300$ min on other items from the company  Another major issue I have is I’ve tried to reach out to the company to see if I could possibly get at least ONE of my pairs reimbursed or some sort of compensation for the insane amount of money I’ve spent with the company. But I have gotten zero response from them. I also am a avid consumer of many of their other jewelry items as well. Over-all i love the brand but they have a lot to work on and if this isn’t considered being a loyal customer i don’t know what is.",

I noticed PAVOI earrings never tarnished, or turned my skin weird colors. I can wear them for days on end without removing them and have zero issues.
