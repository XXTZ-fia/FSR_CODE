They are lightweight and comfortable, much better for someone who doesn’t enjoy the feel of traditional thick, cushy soles. Also, the sizing guide worked well for me. I usually wear 11.5 and sized down as recommended since only 11 and 12 were available, and it worked great. I would prefer slightly wider insoles (minus a star), but I swapped them out with some spares I had at home, and they now feel perfect. So far, I’ve used them for three exercise sessions, and I think they are a great deal for the price.",

I own other barefoot runners (vivobarefoot) and the Whitins just do not compare.  First they are hot - the fabric on the sides and top is thick and retains alot of foot heat (Are my feet naturally hot?  No, I would consider them normal foot temperature).  Second, they don't feel like barefoot shoes - the soles are really thick.  The sole thickness and cushion is comparable to a trail running shoe than a barefooter.  Third, the lacing mechanism is awkward - half nylon lock laces with a velcro strap at the top.  I think a better choice would have been lock laces all the way up or normal laces.Who runs in these shoes?  I'm using them solely as flat pedal biking shoes so I think they will work, but I can't imagine running or walking in them.  There is a reason Whitin's sell at a steep discount to Vivobarefoots - my advice would be to spend the extra money for the higher quality, truly barefoot shoe.",
