Marie,Comfortable and pretty,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15ZM8C8IUPRWZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNFM6D9M,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: SilverSize: Round Diamonds,,"I like the design of these earrings and they are comfortable to wear while sleeping. Which is the main reason I got them. One of them was difficult to unscrew. It was stuck. I had to use a pair of pliers, but was able to do it without damaging them. My only other complaint is that I would’ve liked the back just screw in even tighter, my ears are thin, so the earrings kind of push forward and hang and I have to keep pushing them back. But they are good to wear every day and help with an ear that I recently had re-pierced.",
