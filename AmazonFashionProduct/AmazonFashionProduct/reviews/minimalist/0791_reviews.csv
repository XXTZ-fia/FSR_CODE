I wear it on my index finger which sees a lot of contact with hard scratchy tuff surfaces and after 4 weeks of use it has not been scratched or damaged in any way. Very comfy to wear, it fits exactly as it should. Is relatively lightweight and is def a good value. I seriously have abused this ring and it is just beautiful today as the day I received it.",

And. . .it does.  It is beautiful, shiny, slides on easily, and fits both well and comfortably.  The runes are clearly etched in a perfect circle, and it looks lovely alongside my Norse gear.  Highly recommend for others who likes the runic aesthetic.",

The only negative might be that it’s very reflective. I got this as Vine member and the muted silver was no longer available. In our opinion, that one would have been a bit more attractive.  It’s a good ring for the price. He likes to have lots of options and this one is unique!",
robotkilr,Looks better in person,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S0H33170D2Z9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBVGL685,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 14, 2024",Color: blackRing Size: 10,,The pics don't do this black ring justice. The letters show up as bright silver in daylight embedded in a deep clear coat that protects them from dirt. The whole ring is highly polished inside and out and is smooth on the finger. Good deal.,

M. Lewallen,A Sleek Viking Masterpiece – Just a Small Regret,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2X3BTLRQGAQEA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBVGL685,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 12, 2024",Color: blackRing Size: 13,,"I recently came across the Nanafast Men's Viking Ring, and it looks incredibly sleek and beautiful! The minimalist design and stainless steel craftsmanship are impressive, making it a standout piece. If I had a choice, I might have gone with the retro silver version instead, as it enhances the visibility of the symbols. Nevertheless, this ring is a fantastic option for anyone interested in Viking-inspired accessories. Five stars!",
LVGoodguy,Perfect blend of style and heritage,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3C2DK36I9C25W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBVGL685,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 12, 2024",Color: silverRing Size: 11,,"I recently received the Nanafast Men’s Minimalist Viking Ring, and I couldn’t be more impressed! The design is both sleek and meaningful, perfectly capturing the essence of Viking heritage while maintaining a modern, minimalist style. The stainless steel is of high quality, offering a comfortable fit and a durable, polished finish that resists tarnishing.  This ring makes a fantastic gift for any occasion, whether it’s Father’s Day, Valentine’s Day, or just a treat for yourself. It’s not just a piece of jewelry but a statement of strength and tradition. I’ve received numerous compliments and inquiries about where I got it. I highly recommend this ring to anyone looking for a unique and stylish accessory that honors Viking culture.",
