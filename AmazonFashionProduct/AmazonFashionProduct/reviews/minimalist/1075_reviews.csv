I have a difficult time removing my key card from the side pocket behind the cash clip.  The cash clip is not good. It adds lots of bulk to this wallet.

My existing wallet is BIG at 5.25 x 4.5 inches, however is very thin at no more than 1/4 inch at the thickest point. The nice thing about its size is that it spreads the load over my haunch and doesn't cause any indentations. This new wallet, is a lot smaller, so if that is your deal that will be good. It is 4.5 x 3 inches and it is just a little thicker than my wallet at 3/8 inch. I did test the wallet with a single chip Credit Card in it on a couple of different sales points and none of them were able to read my card, so the wallet does indeed seem to block RFID.  The wallet has some nice points about it, it has slots for 2 credit cards or what have you on the outside of the wallet for easy access, however, I think only 1 card is really easily accessible there. On the inside of the wallet there is a slot for your ID card and 6 more slots for whatever cards you need. However, on the downside, the money clip does not seem to be removable to either make the wallet thinner or to allow better access to the cards. One of the card slots I almost got my card complete stuck, so basically that one is completely unusable. Another one makes it difficult to get things in and out of, so if I could, I would avoid using that one.  I am still debating if I want to use this as my daily wallet due to the lack of a money area (not the money clip) and how some of the card slots are difficult to use. I also haven't tried to put multiple cards in one area, so I don't know how that works, some of the areas are pretty tight so I am not holding my breathe.  If you only run with a couple of card type items and an ID this might be the perfect wallet for you. For me, between cards and medical and misc I have about 10 items I keep in my wallet and so this make the migration concept a bit hard for me. I want to use it, but I am not sure its a daily driver for me. As I have gotten used to large wallets for quite some time, the idea of a small wallet feels like it might dig in a bit, so that has me a little concerned. Again, if you are used to a smaller wallet this is likely not an issue or if you prefer a front pocket wallet this is still a good choice.",
Zach Payne,"Good quality, money clip a little too strong",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SDHPSP7DNKW1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C6486HC1,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2023",Color: Elephant Grey,,"Wallet is a good slim size but a little too big to use in front pockets for me.  Good quality and cards fit snugly and don't seem like they'll come out accidentally.  Money clip is nice but is extremely stiff, to the point where I couldn't even get more than a couple bills without really wrenching on it. Feel like I could easily rip a bill if I wasnt paying too much attention.",
Mark Y.,Very nice minimalist wallet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IP0Q4ULBAX76/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C6486HC1,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 29, 2023",Color: Carbon Black & Red,,"Very nice looking slim wallet.  Majority of the minimalist wallets on the market does not have a good solution for holding cash. This VOOTAI wallet actually does somewhat of a decent job with cash. The metal money clip is able to hold a few changes and won’t get in the way.  No matter how much you want to pretend you don’t need cash, you still going to need it from time to time. I don’t mean to carrying around lots of dollar bills, but at least a reasonable amount. The ability to properly carry some cash should still be a consideration when picking a wallet.  RFID blocking is also a good feature. The protection also includes the two external card slots, which is pretty nice.  Overall a quality built wallet, highly recommend.",
Adam Watkins,Great wallet!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXED3Y840JGKW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C6486HC1,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 29, 2023",Color: Crazy Horse Brown,,"This wallet is really great, and I've been using it, but it's going to work out to be just a little too big for me. It's great all around, though, and I'd definitely recommend.",
