I will say they do run a little bit large, I wear a size 11 1/2 to 12 and I ordered an 11 and I still have plenty of room in the toebox. Which works out great for me because I plan to wear them with thick winter socks for hiking, but if you are a person who likes to wear no drop shoes barefoot you might want to order a size down for a snugger fit. The material is not waterproof, but then again if you take one look at them you’d know that. Honestly, I see all the comments about them not being waterproof and I’m just wondering who the heck took one look at these and thought ”hey, I bet I can trot through standing water in these.” I did spray them with a water resistant spray, and it helps to make them water resistant enough to wear in the rain.",

I have been so impressed that I will be wearing them quite a bit more often. Shoes seem solidly built and the glue seems all look great. They are super comfortable right out of the bag, but I have stinky feet and switched the insoles out for odor eaters. Made zero difference in their original feel which is fantastic! I'm very glad I have found something like this to test out zero drop shoes. So far I'm loving it. Order half size up. I wear a men's 10 and instinctually just got a 10.5. Right choice. Thumbs up! 👍",

The seams and the stitch lines are consistently done.  The fur line is an interesting touch, more a slipper kind of touch than an outdoor shoe touch.The size is on the snug side.  I don't count down on this as I am kind of one of those in between size people.  I am normally between a 10.5 and 11 depending on the cut.  For this one I think an 11 would fit better, but the 10.5 will work fine, nothing pressing or cramping.The lacing system is simple.  It is an elastic band with a quick hold for snugging it tight.  It doesn't really get too tight which is nice for those with taller arches which pushes the instep higher.  This manner of lacing gives support while not squeezing on the top of your foot.The foot box is fine; it has room to expand out at rest and under load.  The insole having the same fur is in line with my slipper motif idea.  I replace that insole with a more comfortable insole for me and it greatly improved how I like the shoes in general wear.  I know it is a minimalist shoe design, so I'm not counting off for this, it is a personal issue for comfort.The grip of the sole is nice.  On smooth or rough surfaces it has a solid grip without feeling any slip.",

I have worn them to the store and while driving and they are “ok” but simply don’t have the support a regular pair of shoes does.  As a lazy Sunday type of shoe they are great.  In regards to the other claims, I’d just say they are great house shoes and leave it there.  I expected them to be more of a house shoe and that’s really what they are.

I had pain in under a half mile, and by the time I got to 1 mile, I knew I'd cause myself problems for tomorrow's run if I didn't cut this short.

Also, the very first time I put the left shoe on and tried to adjust the shoe laces, the lace snapped out of the end holder... they broke!

The initial feel and comfort are excellent. Breathability is so/so, your feet will sweat a little more than normal. These shoes do flex more like a slipper than a shoe and for just bee-bopping around the house in winter with an occasional run out to the mailbox these are a winner and for the price in the slipper space these would be a 5 star all day long.  I knocked this down 1 star because it is not as advertised. (See Video - kicking your foot and dipping it into the water is asking for a wet foot. Hiking in the winter that way is going to end poorly for you.) The water resistance is ok around the shoe, but the moment it is above the tongue or splashes above the tongue your foot is going to get wet. They do resist water well but will soak through after prolonged exposure to water.  I did not knock the shoes down on quality because I need to give it a little more time in use. I will be coming back to change the rating if that is the case. If they hold up, I will leave the rating at 4. I can't do 5 because of the way this shoe was advertised in the video.
