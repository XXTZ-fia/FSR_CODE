So the fact that I can buy these on Amazon for $60 was a major selling point. I bought the men's version for a little extra width, because in my experience, women's Xeros are too narrow for my extra-wide feet. These were comfortable right out of the box, feel like a second skin, and are the perfect width. I adjusted the straps slightly, and am very happy with them. I wore them for a water balloon fight with my kids this weekend and there was zero slipping or sliding. I'm satisfied with the grip. Sizing is accurate.

MJL,Something weird about the thong attachment but they are ok if you don't want cushioning,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKPM1JI9OME2F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9CNJ8ZS,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 22, 2024",Size: 7Color: Blue Sapphire,Verified Purchase,"I have been using Xero shoes for at least five years or more now and this is my third pair of their thong sandals.  I like that the ""cushion"" now extends the whole footbed but the bottom attachment for the thong sits funny on one of the two shoes and that's rather uncomfortable.  If I had time to return and re-order I would have.  Xero shoes are fast fashion, at the end of the day, even if they are not so cheap in cost, so limit your expectations;).  They are zero drop, which my feet need, they have minimal support and cushion.  I usually go to the supermarket and buy gel inserts and cut a line between the big toe and the next and slide them into the sandals if I am walking a lot (amusement parks and such) and that's enough for me to be comfortable, but again, I have been wearing barefoot shoes for many years now so I am used to the more minimalist approach to footwear.  I wish they had more color offerings.  My last pair was chocolate brown and black and they went with everything and I looooved them, but the cushion going the whole shoe is nice on this version.Be aware that Xero shoes are notoriously slippery the first few days.  Break them in ahead of time if you're going to be near water or rain!People compliment me on them so I guess they are ""cute enough (sorry, I don't know the ""dude equivalent"" of ""cute!"" I order men's sizes because they fit better)...""If you can get them on sale, so much the better.  I wear Xeros a LOT, but I only really feel they are worth it when they are on sale because the crafting just isn't on point and there are usually flaws.  Would happily pay more to know they were not made in sweat shops etc...Minimalist barefoot sandals that work? YesBest made shoes ever? NoWill last a lifetime? Not at all, maybe two summer seasons.Hope that helps! ;).",
CarefulPurchaser12,"Great Great Sandals, but Tricky To Adjust At First",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HDTN7XU13QAI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9CNJ8ZS,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 19, 2024",Size: 12Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"I love these sandals.  I almost exclusively run and walk barefoot, but because of cultural prejudice, it is not practical to go around in public or do long walks on sunny days in public places barefoot.  As unfair as it seems, probably the strongest irrational prejudice in western and American society is people going around barefoot, especially with all the problems with the homeless and drug addicts today.  No one even really thinks about it, they don't even think that anyone in their right mind would go without shoes.To demonstrate how silly this is, I wear these sandals when I can't go barefoot.  No one even thinks about it even though I am essentially barefoot in them.  As I said, it is an irrational cultural prejudice.IMPORTANT!!!  Do Not Mess With The Straps On Both Sandals (at first).  You must keep one sandal as it arrived from the factory, until you get the other to fit well.  The layout of these straps with the two buckles and the double cords and constricting holes in the sole is very, very clever and incredibly complex.  If you mess with both of them at the same time, you may never be able to get them right again.Fortunately, my right foot fit nearly perfectly out of the box, so I left it alone.  But I screwed around with the left sandal without knowing what I was doing and created a nightmare.  My toes hung over, it hurt to walk in it and it wouldn't stay on.  I was so frustrated I put them aside for a week.  I then decided to try to re-adjust the left sandal to match the right sandal.  This was not easy, it took several tries, setting the amount of cord coming out of the buckles to be identical with the other sandal, and then pulling and pushing the cords through the hole in the sole.  I finally got the left to look like the right, and put it on, and it it pretty well.  I then tightened one of the buckles closes to my heel about 1/4"" on both sandals to get them to stay up on my heal, and viola! perfect fit, comfortable sandal.Unfortunately, I could find no instructions either on the website or in the package, so I was on my own.  I wouldn't blame others for just sending them back, but it isn't totally necessary.The other thing is if you haven't worn sandals with something between your toes, it will take a few wears for you to get used to them.  I now wear them everywhere.I do recommend that the manufacturer either create documentation on how the strap cords work and how to adjust them, or if such exists, make it easier to find.Great sandals!",6

I’ve never worn sandals or flip flops because I wanted to. I bought these only because I needed help managing my athletes foot.  The straps on these are so small and soft that they don’t chafe or cause my feet to sweat. The part that goes in between the toes is so comfortable. The in between the toe part is why I hate flip flops, and the stupid noise, it sounds like a person smacking their lips. I hate it, but these don’t make a sound. The bottom is super durable yet extremely flexible. The grip on the bottom is incredibly grippy and the soft layer between the bottom and foot feels so comfortable. The cup on the heel ensures that they stay on my feet and the toe part never folds under my feet exposing my toes.  I recommend these to anyone who hates sandals or flip flops.  Ps. I’ve bought other sandals thinking maybe I was being too picky and I was wrong my whole life… nope, these sandals are way better than anything I tried. They might be for you or they might not be, but I say if you are getting sandals out of necessity and want to try something non traditional, try these.",4

I've always liked the design and how lightweight they were, but I didn't like the recent price, nor the plethora of negative reviews about the new materials they're made with these days. I didn't want to drop $100 when other long-time customers were complaining about poor fit, so I went looking for an alternative and found these.  I was unsure of the design, and I really had no idea what to expect from the soles, but the price was right, so I thought I'd try it.  I LOVE them!  I don't wear ""shoes"" and haven't for years. I've put up with wet feet, constricted toes, burning asphalt, and other problems with the Five Finger variety, but I have none of those issues with these sandals. I can walk on damp grass or concrete and my feet stay dry, my toes are free, and I can walk through a parking lot during summer without my feet being scorched.  I'm an AFAB person with wide feet, so I ordered a men's size as suggested on their site. I printed the size gauge on their site also. I wear a size 8.5W Women's, but there are no half sizes, and I was concerned the size 8 Men's might not work. It was a perfect fit!  Despite not wearing shoes for years, I did go through a break-in period. I had difficulties getting the ties right, even after watching their video. My right side was easy, but I struggled to get my left side situated. The knots hurt my foot bones, even though they weren't too tight, but the sensation went away as I figured out how to adjust the knots to my feet.  I have noticed my gait has changed, and I land on my toes and balls of my feet more than I did with the Five Finger Shoes. I've had them roughly a month, and my feet look more muscular and feel more flexible than before. My toes have also become more flexible, and I can splay them out more than before.  I'm extremely happy with these sandals! I'd highly recommend them to anyone into the barefoot thing.",11

The foot bed is uncomfortable. It has a soft center and hard edges, it feels weird where the soft center and hard edges meet. It's super bothersome. I'd rather that the foot bed was all hard instead of this inconsistent design with a rigid transition from one to the other.  I'm also super disappointed that they are not water friendly. I can't wear them on the beach or in the water, they are flimsy and create the perfect drag when stepping through the sand or water. I jumped into a lake with then thinking they would be secure and not only did they creat a drag that caused me to take in water and struggle to the surface, but they started pulling off as I moved my feet through the water. They are dangerous and shouldn't be advertised as Aqua Sandals.  I love the Xero Genesis and recommend those for your barefoot feeling sandals. They also don't work in the sand or water, but are great for everyday activities.  I'm finding this company to be all over the place with sizing and design. They've been around long enough that they can't hide behind the excuse of being a small company anymore. I have six various pairs of Xero shoes and many of them were hard to size. I'm tired of buying shoes from a company that I can't trust. Luckily there are more and more manufacturers making barefoot shoes. I don't recommend these shoes or this company.",3

I bit the bullet and purchased these specifically for those conditions and they do not disappoint.  I have tested them at the river and in sweaty conditions. They performed great! I had to kinda crank down the tightness to keep them from flopping around as I normally wear my sandals pretty loose. The footbed grips reasonably well when wet / sweaty. Perhaps what makes them so much better is that these adjustments are so much easier. The dual-adjustable heel strap makes it super-simple to accommodate different wear conditions on the fly.

Was heading out to Crete for a week of holiday and wanted a sandal that had the barefoot experience, but historically have not got along with flip-flops (foot strap rubs and cuts in) or sandals (heel rubs to a blister). Bought these a day before I flew out, because I'd been over analysing for several months leading up. Best decision I made was to get these. Same kind of walking experience as the vibrams, but open toes. Walking on sand or the hot pavement were fine. No rubbing or tightness. Didn't need to grip the sandal with my toes or arch, the adjustable band on the heel was perfect. I did have one or two experiences where the front on the sandal would get caught in the wet sand and would fold under the ball of the foot, but this was more a problem of me living my foot far enough up than any quality issue with the sandal. Would definitely buy another pair if these wore out (which, having worn these every day for at least 15km of sand and pavement walking every day for 7 days straight, was very minimal). If you're already a barefoot shoe wearer, these should be no issue for you. If you're new to barefoot, there might be a bit of a learning curve. Really solid quality of all materials and fixings.",
