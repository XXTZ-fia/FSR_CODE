Headline,"Nice, well-constructed billfold - perfect width for me",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M3HIEJYOCX9M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B092VR48NK,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 11, 2024",Color: Modern Black,Verified Purchase,"I specifically chose this billfold for its size - 3.25” width. Not 3” nor 3.5”. The reason is that I have a few 5-pocket pants where a billfold can slip into a hidden, zipped pocket. A 3.5” width billfold is difficult to get out of the hidden pocket, and a 3” width doesn’t hide the dollar bills it holds. A wider billfold is fine for most pant pockets, of course, but I wanted mine to fit in the zipped pocket for the added security. I also wanted to avoid the added flap many billfolds include for ID, so it would be a little thinner when cards are added. One note: A 3.25” width doesn’t completely hide larger euro bills (like a 50€). The RFID performs well. I’m happy with the look, feel and quality of this billfold.",6
