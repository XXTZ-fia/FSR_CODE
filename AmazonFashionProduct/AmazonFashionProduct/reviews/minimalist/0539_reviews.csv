I've worn other barefoot shoes prior (including Xeros) and these have so much more comfort in the sole. With these I not only feel I'm helping my feet be naturally spaced within the shoe but also experience a nice cushioned shoe. I liked these so much I searched the internet to find them and was honestly shocked this is where I did and what the price tag was.,

D,🏆These would be fantastic for FAT FEET -no joke❣️,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31J1JXN60REYJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CB7SXL25,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2025",Size: 7.5 WideColor: B-white,Verified Purchase,"These shoes would be amazing for swollen pregnant feet, diabetic feet or ‘fat feet’ as they are roomy all around❣️❣️❣️ 👍👍 They look identical to the product picture 👍👍 Super wide 👍👍 Fabric is a breathable knit, that’s comfortable & gives like the N¡k€’s FREE RN FLYKNIT* fabric does❣️ 👍👍 Cushion in the sole is nice for walking but would not qualify as “barefoot”, AT ALL! These wouldn’t be suitable for “barefoot“ minimalist trail running (like V¡br@m’s) but these are thin yet comfy enough to be a good option for 🏋️ lifting in. 👍👍 Heel has a loop to pull up on when putting on these shoes or to carabiner hook to a backpack when hiking/drying/etc. 👉 FYI they have minimal arch support 👎 These are made for feet that are wide all around, as stated above. The average minimalist shoe consumer is generally just looking for a wider toe box, flexibility in the sole of the shoe, NOT a shoe that has tons of fabric in the middle for very swollen or fat feet. When tightened and tied, the (extra) fabric in the middle of these shoes bunches up A LOT!  *I love my FLYKNIT N¡k€’s but they are a slender, shoe with too small of a toe box so I was hoping that these would be wider knit option.",

I've never used naturalist shoes before but now I don't think I'll go back to regular shoes. It is so nice not having my feet shoved into narrow shoes and my neuroma between my third and fourth toe no longer hurts at all after wearing these. The heel could use a little more padding, but once I broke the shoes in I haven't noticed that as much. I also love that they're stretchy enough that I can leave them tied and just pull them on and off. They're breathable, comfortable, and sporty. I bought a size 7 and that's my typical shoe size. My toes sometimes hit the end while walking, though it's just barely and because my toes aren't being squished together it doesn't bother me, but consider buying 1/2 a size up when you buy them.",

And let me tell you they are the most breathable shoes, so breathable in fact that they make my feel so freaking cold. I have raynauds and wow my feet freeze in these. I got them in the fall so I realized will have to save them for summer use only.  My 12 year old son is embarrassed by them and thinks they make me look like a duck 🤷🏻‍♀️. Oh well, I think they’re cute and they are def wide toe & barefoot approved!",

I don't know how long they will last but while they do I'm loving them. They are soft around the foot and feel great. I've walked at least 1 mile in them at one time without issue but I am used to walking in zero drop shoes. I was looking for a daily alternative to spare my more expensive Altra shoes and these fit the bill - I bought 2 more pairs!,
LJ's Mom,Clown shoes - must actually have wide feet for these to work.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EZF2IFO1RMW2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CB7SXL25,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 3, 2024",Size: 9 WideColor: C-taupe,Verified Purchase,"I don't have wide feet but have a capsulitis issue in one foot and my podiatrist recommended trying a wide shoe with a wide toe box. Lots of online searches later, I found this shoe. Unless you actually have wide feet, these shoes may not work for you. I agree with others about the padding, particularly in the heal area - it is quite substantial. But they fit like flippers and the front part of my foot just slides around in there. I normally wear and ordered a size 9. I have at least an inch of space from my big toe to the end of the shoe. It's almost comical how big they are - they are like clown shoes. Giving 3 stars because these may work for others, but beware of their sizing.",
Nikki,"Cool design and fit, needs more support",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34D639TSBXA5N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CB7SXL25,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 3, 2024",Size: 11 WideColor: Darkred,Verified Purchase,"My expectations were low when these went on sale for $23, and lower when they showed up wrapped in plastic instead of in a shoebox. But these are feet-shaped! If you are not a 10,000-steps-a-day person, they're probably awesome.  There was no break-in period for me, no chafing or blisters, no bunion pain. I put them on and it was like having custom-made shoes.. They're snug in the right way and my toes aren't squished.  The only drawback is there isn't a lot of padding/support. So these are my shoes for cute colors and comfort, and others for when I'm more active. But now my dilemma is do I buy 3 more pairs in different colors or spring for the brand name shoes and hope for more padding?",9

I wear them almost everyday to work. I like the style of these. They are lightweight and have a little cushioning. The wide toe box is wonderful. I have wide feet and an high arch. I can wear these all day with no problem. There is no arch support. You can feel gravel/rocks when you are walking. I wouldn’t hike in them. They are easy to clean. I also have the grey with gum sole. They have held up nicely.,5

They have little traction at all and sent me sliding on a tile floor their first day of use. Once that happened I immediately changed into my spare shoes.  Do not buy if the anti-slip feature is a huge draw for you as I could have been seriously injured had I fallen in the scenario I was in.,
