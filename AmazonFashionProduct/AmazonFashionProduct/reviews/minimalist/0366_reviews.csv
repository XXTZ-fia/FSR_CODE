Sophia,"Pretty design, very petite, sizing seems a bit small",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R5TWBD7R8E67/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKTLRDPY,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Ring Size: 6,,"This is a very delicate and pretty ring. I really like the interlocking parts and the different stone shapes. I ordered a size 6, but it’s fitting like a size 5. That’s not terrible, but wasn’t the ring finger I really wanted it for. It is great for stacking rings, but they’d have to be fairly thin, as this takes up space on your finger. If you can get it for the size you want, the price is great, and so far it’s not tarnishing or irritating my finger.",
ey,Beautiful!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG8Y8WXM93CVL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKTLRDPY,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Ring Size: 6,,"I love this ring, it's so gorgeous on.  It's also comfortable, non-tarnish, and very sturdy considering it's made of titanium and stainless steel.  The color is a more traditional 14k tone - not too light or yellow.  It would make a great gift for anyone who likes to wear fashion rings, and it's reasonably priced for the quality and unique design you get.  Highly recommend!",
