I don't need my Sams Club Membership card, cash, various gift club rewards cards, blood donor card, or employee ID badge when I'm out riding roller coasters with my kids, hiking trails to the waterfalls, or I'm out for a motorcycle ride to nowhere.  I decided to give one of these Holdsmith minimalist wallets a try.  What drew me to order?  1) price was reasonable, 2) plastic, I didn't want a metal one scratching up my phone when I need to keep them both in the same pocket, 3) Color choice, I wanted something bright to stick out in case I set it down or it fell out of my pocket, 4) It would hold the my ID and credit card SNUG - and it DOES! and 5) It had to be as small as possible - the whole point of it being 'minimalist'.  It also get bonus points for being made in the USA, having some grippy ribs molded in so I my sweaty hands don't drop it after a hike or ride, and kinda sorta matches my bike if you squint hard enough.  I haven't had it for long, but the plastic seems durable enough to last awhile, so I don't think I'll have to use that Lifetime Warranty.",

The only thing I don't like is sometimes the money clip and even the corners can poke your bum if it's positioned weird in your pocket. I know they are supposed to be front pocket wallets, but I just have a habit of putting it in my back pocket. I came across the Holdsmith wallet and gave it a shot - particularly based on a photo of cash going inside the wallet.  This things weighs next to nothing, but it doesn't feel flimsy. I was a bit concerned about how much it could take being in my back pocket and being sat on - but so far no signs that it's not up to the task. I also like the ""clamp"" mechanism so it adjusts to how many cards you have in it and it really does hold them tightly! I have taken the wallet and slapped it against my hand to see if I can get the cards to fling out and they won't.  For price and functionality - I think this is a much better wallet that the Ridge-style wallets. I think the only thing that could be a question is durability...but so far, it is holding up very well to being sat on all day. I would highly recommend this wallet if you are looking for something minimal, lightweight, and something that won't break the bank.",

To access your cards, simply press up on the bottom to slide them out. The design is such that they don't fall out. It measures about 2 3/8"" W x 3 5/8"" L. It is just shy of 1/2"" thick.  For years I have had a traditional wallet, taking up too much space in my purse, making it difficult to locate exactly what cards I need, and time consuming to change from one purse to another. With this, I can easily and quickly move what I need from my regular purse to a dressy clutch purse, add my lipstick, phone and comb and I'm good to go. No time consuming sorting, misplaced credit or identification cards. This also easily fits in a pocket for an on the go lifestyle.  It comes in an array of vibrant colors and two different textures.

Well, I switched to this wallet a few weeks ago and I love it. Everything stays in place even with just a few cards, but the cards still slide out easily thanks to the various cutouts. It doesn't bother me in my back pocket when I sit on it all day, and I like the look and feel of it. My only suggestion would be to add a small hole somewhere that you could thread a wrist strap or something similar through, for times when I want something a bit more secure to hold onto.

JD,Minimalist and lightweight,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SXGKJLE8EAL4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CW287CDR,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 28, 2024",Color: Ribbed Brown Matte TextureStyle: Ribbed Texture (Rt),,"This sturdy plastic frame is about as simple as you get, but it's not the thinnest solution around.  Still, I appreciate the straightforward approach that requires no springs or other tricky mechanisms.  Your cards are simply pressed between some curved plastic braces (1 front, 2 back).  Whether it's a single card or multiple cards, they are suspended in the middle of the frame.  If you place your cards with the back towards the two braces, the signature area typically falls between them so you needn't worry about rubbing it off.  Cards have a bit of resistance putting them in, but after you pass the midway point they nicely click into place.  You pay very little in terms of weight versus other options, but the thickness is fixed.  Correspondingly, I'd go with a different approach if I had three cards or less.Overall I like it, but not for all occasions.  The stiff frame means pocket bulge and little flex.  Few cards will mean wasted space, and of course there's no RFID protection.  Bravo for being made in the USA though.",2

It comes in a nice box, just the wallet within. It's incredibly straightforward: your cards go in the open slot.  This wallet is SO LIGHT. I love minimalist wallets, and have a less-than-minimal collection. This is by far the lightest one of the bunch. What's really cool is that the cards CLICK IN to the wallet. They lock into place, which I was not expecting. It's really, really cool.  This wallet, being some poly material, will likely never break. I got the orange as I'm notorious for losing things and this will make it much easier to dig out.  My only complaint is that grease is very noticeable on this, so if you're buying this for someone who works with their hands you may want to opt for a darker color.  I recommend!",
