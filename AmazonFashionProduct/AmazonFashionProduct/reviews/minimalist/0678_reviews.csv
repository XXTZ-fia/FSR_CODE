When I asked him why he always wore these shoes, he replied that it was because they were his comfiest shoes. Imagine his surprise when I told him that he was now a fan of barefoot shoes! Honestly, I have several pairs of these myself, and they are very comfortable, yet very inexpensive for barefoot shoes, making them perfect for the person who wants to try some barefoot shoes without spending a fortune - whether they know they’re doing so or not! 😁",

The toe box is perfectly wide to match the curvature of my feet - about half a centimeter of wiggle room on by big toe, and half a centimeter on the pinky, with both feet, that's perfect. I know the barefoot style of shoe isn't for everyone, but these fall into that category, though they're a little more padded than typical - gotta keep the feet warm, and I think they hit a good balance. I've been out in the snow with these and they're thin enough to have halfway decent ground feel while also almost completely isolating me from the otherwise imminent frostbite. I've seen other reviews mention removing the insole for more feel at the expense of insulation, maybe I'll do that closer to summer. The false fur they're lined in is very plush, I can feel the texture and plush of it even through socks and I find it very comfortable, at least until my feet start sweating while I'm indoors. I haven't slipped in them by accident, they're not as unforgiveably grippy as my pair of Merrell Vapor Glove 6es, but they do have some good grab on all the surfaces I've walked on so far. I'm no fashion nut or anything, but I don't think they look bad, about like a stereotypical cold weather high top shoe would look, just odd with how wide the toe is. It's up for anyone else buying these to decide whether they like them or not, but I have no strong opinions myself other than that I don't mind the look. I can't speak on behalf of the durability yet, I haven't had them for terribly long to be able to tell, but they haven't fallen apart yet after two days so I guess that's a good sign.",2

If you take out the insole they become truly barefoot, but they get colder. So that’s a trade-off you have to decide about. They are barefoot shoes, so they are totally flat. The insole was also flat, but it took away ground feel and squished the feet in on the edges.  I bought one size bigger than I usually buy because I am going to wear thick socks. And it was a good thing, my usual size wouldn’t have fit thick socks.  I am a woman buying men’s shoes because all of Whitin’s women’s boots options were unappealing. I just wanted a good, winter-friendly, tie-up boot with zero drop. So men’s styles it is. I wouldn’t wear them anywhere as a dress shoe, but they are good everyday boots.  *update* I did something crazy and cut the raised edges off the insole and put it back in my shoe. They feel like barefoot shoes now and are perfectly warm from the bottom. The top lets in cold, though. Wear thick socks. They are waterproof if you are just walking around like a normal person. I haven’t tested them against puddle jumping.",13

Well, these are wide and I don't need wide, but they fit good enough for me. It is not super cold here yet, but it is chilly and these are warm, all except for the sole, which is kind of expected. I do like the fleece like lining, it's cozy. Not a fan of laces, but I did not need to loosen the laces too much to get these on.  Only criticism, and this is just my opinion, I am not a fan of how the top of the toes area looks. It does not look bad, just looks sort of weird. Part of that might be because these are wide. Just wish they did something a little different. Kind of like clown shoes?  Overall, they are good shoes, price is just okay, would recommend.",2

I generally wear mine with the laces loose and untied, just knotted inside each of the top eyelets.  This facilitates fast on-and -off, just like the shearling slippers they resemble.  The shoes are relatively light, but—especially with my laces so loose—do not provide a lot of ankle support.  As advertised, the toe box is wide, giving the whole front end of each foot lots of freedom to move, and extra air flow.* Specifically to any Disneyland / Star Wars fans:  I often Disney-bound, especially for Galaxy's Edge.
