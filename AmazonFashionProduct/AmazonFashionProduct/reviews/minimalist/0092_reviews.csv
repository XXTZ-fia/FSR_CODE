Savvy Shopper,LOVE these boots,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R152GT67SVWNAW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQVXRF5,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Size: 7.5Color: Coffee,,Love the fit and comfort of these boots.  The block heal makes them easy to walk around in all day.  Stretch top is a nice fit around the legs.  I love them so much I am thinking of getting them in another color.  Highly recommend.,

The heel is solid and stable and the knit is very comfortable and easy to wear even for all day use. Decent support and they're exactly as pictured in the photos.  Great value for the pair and would recommend.,

They’re incredibly comfortable for all-day wear. The heel is sturdy, and the footbed has just the right amount of padding. I’ve worn them for long walks without any discomfort, and they’ve become a staple in my wardrobe.",
Lori G,Very comfortable stretchy calves,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2W6LGSPUMUMWB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQVXRF5,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 17, 2024",Size: 7.5Color: Coffee,,Cute boots with an overall knit fabric shot through with shiny threads.  These are pull-on boots with a good amount of “give” to the fabric around the calves and ankles making them comfortable for me to wear all day without the fabric digging in to my ankles or constricting my calves - since I have what I consider to be wide calves.  The heels are a good height for all-day normal activity.  Glad to have added these to my boot wardrobe.,
Simply Sally,Cute and comfortable - sweater material is not itchy at all.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26MUQNFP5KAFD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQVXRF5,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 11, 2024",Size: 6.5Color: Coffee,,Highly recommend for a cute date-night outfit!  The glitter material is super comfortable and does not itch at all like you would think.  The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the sizing. The boot has a pointed toe and so I would order a size smaller than you think thanks to the extra room in the toe.,

Jasmine,"So cute, but snug!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R322YD41640O5Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQVXRF5,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 6, 2024",Size: 7.5Color: Coffee,,"Really love these boots! They look absolutely gorgeous! They appear just as the photos, I love the sweater boot aesthetic. The quality seems to be great so far. The only issue is the sizing. These are a bit snug. I usually wear an 8 and while they still fit, I can feel my toes scraping the front. I know I won’t be able to wear them long without getting uncomfortable. The sweater part for me great, which was a pleasant surprise as I have small calves and typically struggle finding boots that fit well on my legs. If you have larger calves then these would not be a good choice.",

Muttley,Knit dress boots that definitely run small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2W2W3YV6LC110/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQVXRF5,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 4, 2024",Size: 7.5Color: Coffee,,"I received these boots for free through the Amazon Vine Program. At the time, they were listed at $59.99 after a discount from the original price of $74.99. Shipping was fast, and they arrived in a beautiful box with secure packaging. The boots themselves were in perfect condition upon arrival. I wear a size 8 with narrow feet, but these boots felt very tight, more like a 7.5. Although I hoped the block heel would make them more comfortable, the snug fit really took away any added ease. I don’t think I could wear them for more than a couple of hours without discomfort. Style-wise, they were okay, though the bright tinsel woven into the fabric was more prominent than I expected—personally, I would have preferred them without it. I’d recommend ordering a half or full size up if you want a more comfortable fit. Overall, I found them a bit pricey for what they offer.",

Beautiful and fit amazing, but run small.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K5SFYCEH5DZJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQVXRF5,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 3, 2024",Size: 7.5Color: Coffee,,"Ordered a size 8, but my wife wears a size 7 shoe.

I accidentally ordered an 8 and I wear a 7 however these fit me perfectly. It’s a very comfortable fit too! They’re so cute and the quality is amazing so they are worth every penny. I didn’t expect the shimmer to be as pretty as it is.  Another thing for my wide calf girlies, these fit mine so well. The leg part is so stretchy and even with that stretchiness the ankle support is really good. I love these!",

They are so cute! I wear a 7 1/2 or 8 depending on how the shoe is made. I went with an 8 in these boots, so glad that I did. These boots are a little snug around the toes, they might be uncomfortable if you have wide feet. I've only worn them around they house but they seem pretty comfortable. I love the look and fit of these boots. I think I want another color! I would purchase again and recommend. I think the price point is reasonable for a pair of nice boots!",
