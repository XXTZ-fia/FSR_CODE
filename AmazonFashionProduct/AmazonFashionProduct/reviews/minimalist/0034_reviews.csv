Will need to test them out for a few days of course. Go for a walk. Work out a little in them. Maybe around town etc. Nevertheless I am able to know right away the size was 100% spot on. I wear a men’s size 10 and ordered the 10 even tho a few reviews said order up. They feel extremely comfortable and well made. They’re probably not designed for heavy use or heavy working out running basketball and things like that but I’m already thinking if you take care of these shoes and keep them clean they should last you quite a long time. Shoe laces in my opinion are better than average quality. Some people said they had issues with the laces. I don’t know about that. mine are great. Few family members already noticed and asked where I got them. Seems like they like them enough to have their own. I will probably order 1 or 2 more pairs very soon since I’m at least 90% confident that whenever this pair wears out I will want the same shoes again without having to be concerned if they’re ever discontinued at some point. Anyways I will absolutely recommend these shoes. I got the black with the white soles and laces and look cool and study enough for me. Besides I you don’t like them Amazon will let you return most things anyways so hey. Hope the review helps!,2
