I had gotten used to wearing shoes with flat soles (no heel height) but I needed more support for my feet. These feel like walking barefoot, but with armor protecting your soles. I, personally, like the fact that these aren't true minimalist shoes, the padding around the rest of the for is nice. They can be a little slick on wet pavement, mostly aggregate, but otherwise they're fine. My feet sweat badly so I always wear socks to keep my shoes from smelling bad. With that in mind, I haven't found any hot spots or rough places inside that weren't the result of a sock being misaligned. Suffice it to say, I get happy when I get to put my shoes on now!",3
