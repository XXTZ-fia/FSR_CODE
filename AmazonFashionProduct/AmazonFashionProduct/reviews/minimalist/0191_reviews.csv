They are true to size, fit perfectly, just like a barefoot/zero drop shoe should. They have amazing flexibility and do not slip when my son is out side running at recess. He has worn them in all types of weather, as he refuses to wear any other shoe! They are durable enough to hold up through a 6 year old playing outside everyday. I ordered the next size up, Big kids 1, because my son was afraid he would one day outgrow the 13's he has now, lol! They allow him to jump and feel the ground beneath him, while also giving support to his ankles and cushioning inside the shoe.He loves the all black high top look, and gets compliments all the time. Super functional shoe!",
