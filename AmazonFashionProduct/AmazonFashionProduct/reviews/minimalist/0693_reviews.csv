Amazon Customer,Not a good deal,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PPSKSI2VRLN2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4C3JH3R,"2.0 "," the United States "," June 17, 2024",Size: 13Color: Black,,These sandals miss the mark big time. They are surprisingly heavy. There is very poor adjustment to fit and the heel starts to drag from weight after a bit. The upper pad that meets the foot has worn thru after just s few walks. They look good but poor functionality on trail. Not at all what I expected. Poor quality for the price.,
Robert Woodbury,They’re okay!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QAAT9N80HTAJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4C3JH3R,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 27, 2024",Size: 11Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"These are pretty okay. I like the design, and they’re easy to get on and off once you’ve adjusted them.  I wish they were wider, and that they had better adjustability with the straps to reduce sagging at the heel.  If you get them wet, your feet will slip around a LOT. I do not recommend these for days where you might encounter water.  The foam liner tends to deteriorate rather quickly.  The hook and loop (Velcro) patches need to be longer, because you run out of room for adjustments. Getting the adjustments right to where they don’t rotate off center from your foot is an absolute pain, but they’re infinitely better than the HFS II’s which I only got two months of use out of before they completely fell apart.  With all of this being said, I can’t say I’m completely satisfied with them. They’re close to being a great sandal, but the shortness of the hook and loop patches really detracts from making them a better fit to my foot.  Gripes aside, they’re comfortable when they’re dry.  I was extremely skeptical buying another Xero Shoes product after my previous experience, and probably wouldn’t have ever tried them again if it weren’t for this pair of sandals. Hopefully these are better.",4
