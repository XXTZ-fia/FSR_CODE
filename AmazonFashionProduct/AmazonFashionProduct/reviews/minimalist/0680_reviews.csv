Since I suffer from a painful bunion on my right foot I really wanted to try the concept out without investing a huge amount of money at first. I happened to catch these during prime day and liked how simple the style is making them a good choice for casual wear or, as in my case, work.  I like the look of them in general though a coworker commented on my ""grandma"" shoes. But I found that they actually weren't as wide in the area I needed them to be as I had hoped. I actually found them to be more painful for my bunion than my usual Converse preferred shoe and that they rubbed the same area on the opposite foot to the point of making it sore. I did find them very comfortable for my heels, arches, and ankles. This is after 9-11 hour work days on ceramic tile flooring in a restaurant.  Overall, I don't love them and I probably wouldn't recommend them for those looking at them as a barefoot shoe option.
