As a beginner's wallet, it has been simply perfect, and I think any parent looking to teach their kid about managing money will appreciate it.First things first, its minimalist design is both sleek and practical. I noticed my son beaming with pride when he removed this wallet from his pocket—it's like his own little rite of passage into adulthood. It's funny how something so small can make them feel so grown-up. Moreover, the money clip feature is incredibly handy. My son loves how secure his few bills and cards feel. In an era where bulky wallets are out and simplicity is in, this wallet fits right in. If you're someone who appreciates products that balance form, function, and value, then this wallet ticks all the boxes. In my experience, finding that balance isn't always easy, but this wallet does it effortlessly. So, yeah, if you're considering this as a gift for your son, or even yourself, I wholeheartedly recommend it. It's a simple, yet significant, step in helping someone manage money with style and confidence.",

That’s the way it should be. Holds everything in nice and secure. My old one was completely worn out and the cards would just fall out.  I know I shouldn’t, but my wallet goes in my back pocket. I use the money clip to clip to the pocket. There’s going to be plenty of wear and tear on this thing. I’ll update if it breaks or wears out fast.  Overall, feels pretty good.

However, I wouldn't really recommend this specific model if you always tend to carry cash with you.  Do note that your cards will be prone to scratching. The wallet is basically squeezing them together so that they remain snug inside. That, and on top you're also sliding them against each other when you take them out. The card scratching is of course a given, but I wanted to point that out for anyone who may not have thought of that.",2

O,2nd Furid minimalist wallet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R85A05A6SIPVW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9VSY234,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2024",Size: Minimalist WalletColor: Lunar Silver,Verified Purchase,"I have bought one 2022, the older version with screws, still have it and using it but my poor rhino is worn out so I wanted to get a new one.  Overall this version is solid, the only thing I do not like is the opposite side does not have a stretchy band. Although I do not think that matters as my cards have never fallen out of my original one. Only way it would slide off is if it has less cards than it usually holds. Also the money clip holder is slightly slimmer than the one I have. I usually have 12-15 cards in different thickness in it but majority are your normal credit card thickness  I do like the brush surface of this new one, very slick looking. The solid build compared to the old one really stands out(screwed plate over another)  RFID- I tested both wallets at my work and it blocked off the reader from reading my work card. Did it in several angles just in case lol  Just wish they sold the detachable money clip separately so I can have a shiny rhino again ahahaha",7
