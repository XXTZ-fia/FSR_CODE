It almost looks like the sides and back of the ring have been repeatedly scratched by other jewelry, but they haven’t. The top of the ring still looks okay, but I do find it disappointing that this ring hasn’t even lasted 2 weeks. I guess it’s worth the money *technically* because it looks and feels nice for being cheap, but I had much higher expectations. Amazon wants me to mention the weight, so I will say that it feels high quality but not overly heavy.",

I love the weight and style of this ring - it's big enough to be a statement piece without being overdone or gaudy. I bought this in a size 9 and it fits well on my middle finger.  The color and design of this ring is great. The gold is neither too yellow or too pale. That said, I started to wear it daily without removal because I loved it so much. After about two months, the bottom gold plating has come off and it is starting to make my finger green.  For occasional wear or a special occassion, I think this is a truly fantastic ring! I learned the hard way that it doesn't quite have the longevity I was hoping for but for the price point, I think it's great and I'll just buy a new one.  Highly recommend! Buy it, you won't be dissapointed!",2
