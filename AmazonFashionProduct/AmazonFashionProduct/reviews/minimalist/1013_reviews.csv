I love the price point so I can buy several pairs in different colors to match outfits. I have a pair of Xero Shoes and honestly enjoy my Whitin shoes more especially for the price difference. Didn't necessarily feel Xero was worth double or triple the price compared to Whitin. They hold up just fine, to be fair the bottoms of the Xero's may last longer, but the fabric part of the Whitin's seem to have more longevity. But again, for the price point, I enjoy my Whitin shoes!",

If a return or refund is possible, I will absolutely raise my rating. However, given the circumstances, I don't feel that I can fairly give the product any more than two stars.",

My sister has a lot of serious foot problems that can only be solved by breaking all the bones and rebuilding her feet, and since that is not really an option, we try shoes to help her every few months. I told her barefoot shoes with the super wide toe box and zero drop maybe be an option but it seemed so counterintuitive since her feet hurt and you would think lots of padding is a cure. So I figured it was worth a shot. She put them on to wear around the house and told me the next day all my pain is gone, but it seems this weird shape will cause more problems in the long run. Well her pessimism was proved wrong. She has never been happier with a shoe. I have bought her every color. We get the mens because mens shoes tend to run a little wider anyway and she really does love them.",

For the price, it's a good buy. I work retail and have worn these daily since I bought them. There's plenty of room for the toes. It's pretty comfortable to wear, as it is lined with what seems like very thin foam, and there's extra padding on the back of the ankle. The outsole is very thin, so you'll feel a lot of what you step on. It also has pretty good grip on dry surfaces. I primarily used them on smooth concrete or light trails and there's still plenty of life in the soles.  The shoe is very flexible, which is good for kneeling tasks. A problem, however, is that the upper has split from the outsole where the toes bend, but that's to be expected for the price.",

The quality is decent for the price. I usually get about 9 months of use before the tread goes bald and the insert comes unglued. This is a great length of time for a product of this price, especially considering I wear them as my primary shoe nearly every day for 12+ hours.  If you've never used ""barefoot"" shoes before, it can take a week or two to get used to walking on the balls of your feet instead of your heels, and feeling more texture in the surfaces you walk upon. But this is good for the health of your feet, so I suggest keeping it up until they feel natural.  My only real complaint about is the tread can be slick on wet surfaces. It'd be nice if the tread was a tad deeper or had slightly wider grooves. But I realize there is only so much that can be done with a sole as thin and flexible as these, and it's only mildly more slippery than the sole of standard sneakers. But it's enough of an issue that I actively avoid wearing them on wet decks or sport courts.  You should definitely give these shoes a try if you have any interest in barefoot shoes, or just an economical, comfortable all-around footwear solution. I doubt I'll ever go back to standard shoes again. Very happy customer!",

They fit like a glove, and are my ideal balance between something to protect the bottom of my feet but not inhibit foot and toe movement and ground contact.  I use them as daily drivers, but they would make good shoes for lifting or movement workouts and have used them a little for both.  They grip extremely well, in loose soil, smooth floors, wet concrete, and everywhere else I've gone with them.  They tie up ok (a little wrinkly towards the toebox), and seem durable with no separations at the glued seams, or things pulling out of the canvas.  I'm somewhere between 50 and 100 miles into them, including a bit of running, calisthenics, and a trail walk, but mostly just getting around town and travelling. They've done well in all of these, though I noted that they performed least well on the trail, where they are a bit too stiff but also lack sufficient tread for uneven/natural terrain (the slightly harder sole makes it difficult to wrap your toes/feet around rocks and roots like a more barefoot style would let you, but they lack sufficient tread to grip rock and root like a proper hiking shoe/boot.)  I was pleasantly surprised with how grippy the soles are. I've walked across a marble floor on rainy days that I've known to be slippery and found the traction to be extreme (like new gummy soles). And yet, they gave minimal chirping and no squeaking, unlike most grippy shoes. It was comparable to a good pair of basketball shoes.  Their biggest problem so far is that they don't clean up well. Having gotten some mud on them, I found that a couple of attempts at hand washing with soapy water was insufficient. They are still faintly dingy now, a subtle difference from their initial pure black look. I've now sprayed them with a waterproofing coat, which should help reduce how heavily it stains in the future (and also give slight protection for puddle season, though I still wouldn't trust them to keep your feet dry in a proper rain.)  I purchased these perceiving them as budget barefoots, but think they hold up to the high dollar contenders. Pleasantly surprised and am ordering another pair. They've served well and I'd be surprised if they failed before 2025, but wouldn't feel put out if they did.",8

I’ve been wearing these shoes for about two months and my initial impression was that it feels like I’m walking barefoot. By that I mean the way I stand and move is exactly like it is when I’m shoeless. Obviously, ground-feel is different from barefoot but it is closer to actually being barefoot than it is to wearing conventional shoes. I feel like this should not have surprised me but I’ve never experienced shoes like this before.  Fit and finish seem good, but not perfect, overall and they seem hearty enough.

Grip is amazing (and pleasantly squeaky on the concrete floors at Home Depot). Fit is like a sock.  *Important* The thin insoles they come with really really really help the adjustment period from full cushion to zero drop cushionlessness. I kept mine in and my feet feel so much stronger already.  Highly recommend a waterproofing spray but I just took a plain paraffin wax candle and rubbed it all over the upper. After the whole upper was sufficiently waxed (removing the laces really helps!), the color was white from the wax. I took a hair dryer, turned it on high heat, and warmed the shoes with it. The wax melted and it's a very solid natural long lasting waterproofing finish.  Highly recommend these.  Update:  One little thing I really don't like is they're not as wide as I would like barefoot shoes to be. My feet are supposed to have more room to spread out but the shoes are 'normal' width. Keep this in mind.  No other problems.",13

Ever since I started wearing them, I no longer experience any pain in my feet nor shins. However, you'll need to ""re-learn"" how to walk in them. It's best if you take a few minutes read up on or watch a demonstration video on transitioning to barefoot shoes.  Also, I highly suggest using them with toe socks and toe spacers for the ultimate barefoot shoe walking experience! :)  Lastly, they're not waterproof nor water resistant. So, be sure to use some sort of water repellant spray with them.",
