It does all it claims to do. It’s thin , well made and holds every thing I need it to hold . The reason I purchased this wallet was my previous thick wallet that I carried in my back pocket was breaking my credit cards. This wallet keeps the credit cards nice and flat and is thin enough to carry in a front pocket. I like to read all the reviews when I purchase something . To the person who gave it three stars because he didn’t like the “belt “ clip it is a money clip and it works as advertised. This wallet is not inexpensive but for me it is well worth the money. I don’t like to have to replaced damaged credit cards. The one thing I cannot address in this review is longevity. I think by carrying it in a front pocket and not sitting on it the wallet should last a long time . It comes with a lifetime warranty in the box.",

As a result, my wallet holds 13 cards.  I did not like the money clip so I did remove it (easily detached with the screwdriver that came with the wallet).  If ever this wallet breaks (probably not going to for a while) I would definitely buy the same model as a replacement.",

No more straining to pull out cards and then fanning through them looking for the store card you rarely use.  The only reason I can't give this 5 stars is that the clear practice over the license holder started breaking down after about 6 months.,

This really struggles with cash. The reason that matters is that cash is mostly the reason normal wallets are bulky; you take the cash out, and they become pretty slim. I do like this product, though. It's just not the life-changing innovation or quality that would warrant an instant switch from my old leather wallet.",2
