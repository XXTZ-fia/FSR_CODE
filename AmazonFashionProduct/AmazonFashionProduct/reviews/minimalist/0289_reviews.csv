Once I got them I wasn’t in love with the shape at the top of the foot….almost a webbed foot vibe. Which I don’t notice in the pics advertised. But anywho, I didn’t really care because I just needed something. So the day comes and I wear them. I got several compliments, asking where I got them. They were pretty well padded (others complained of feeling rocks through theirs) I didn’t have any issues. The bottom of the sole is flat with ridges for traction- rocks don’t get stuck in any holes and no slipping. No blisters- which I’m prone to. I hiked, wadded/swam over 8 miles and was very comfortable and breathable. They are a soft material but supportive and great quality. I’m not in shape by any means, so I figured my legs or hips would be sore…but didn’t have an issue with that. (Pic was when we got home)",

I bought these for a trip to Puerto Rico where I knew I'd be hiking and doing various water activities and at times, a combo of both. These things held up amazing! If you've ever hiked on jagged limestone you know how quickly that kind of terrain wears down the soles of your shoes and how important toe protection is. I wore these for several such all day hikes on very rough limestone and they still look/feel brand new and kept my toes safe from getting cut up on the rocks. And on slippery surfaces (slick wet rock, mud, etc.) these puppies had great grip! I really love the space in the toe box also. It allows your feet/toes to engage with the ground more naturally. Now that I'm home, I actually wear these to workout in and for running errands around town.",6

I purchased the style with elastic laces and no tongue, which I prefer, as it feels like a sock. Depending on the brand I can wear a 6, 6.5 and 7, so I ordered 6.5-7. It runs large in my opinion, but it was ideal as I added a 4mm foam insole under the one it comes with, which made the shoe ultra cushiony.  The outsole has a thread that could work on moderate trails and the fabric is breathable and stretchy.  I'm planning on using this specific pair by the beach or on easy hikes during summer.  Compared to other barefoot shoes I own, these ones are particularly wide and might be too much for someone with narrow feet.",

They are comfortable but I did not realize they have holes in the bottom of the shoe, I suppose to let water out. The description does not clearly state there are drainage holes. I assumed they are called water shoes because they are quick dry. I still wear them, as I like them for everyday wear and workouts, but I cannot wear them in the rain or mud. They also get full of dust and sand, but are easy to clean.  It looks like there are two different soles on the shoes listed here. The one with the more minimal tread is the sole with holes. I can't speak for the other tread type. These are great water shoes, but not a good replacement for standard barefoot shoes.",

The price and fun colors were what sold me. Great for camping. Easy to slip on and I could walk through the woods with ease. They dry easily from puddles, streams or just morning dew. I threw them in the wash and they came out looking like new. These are a “barefoot” shoe. They are breathable and protect your feet but it is a much different sole. You can feel the ground and terrain under you- it isn’t uncomfortable or painful just a more grounded experience. Plenty of room although I do not require a wide shoe. The main reason I am even making this review is because I took them to Portugal and it was a lot of walking with very different terrain and a lot of inclines. We also did a couple of moderate hikes which included very rocky ground. My feet were sore but not in the average crappy shoe way. The backs don’t rip up my ankles after hours of walking and again they were washed without issue. Buy these. They’re funky, affordable, and work for anything. Use them for day to day walking, as water shoes, to hike, camp or just because they’re fun.",6

I wear an 11 and feel like they’re pretty true to size with a comfy toe box. Only reason why I gave 4 not 5 stars is because I was still covered in sand and it was difficult to get the sand out of these.

I wear them A LOT, but not every day for a job where I'm on my feet all day long. I did like a few suggested & added arch inserts because I have a high arch. I have ZERO problem with this shoe. I use them for working out & trips to the grocery, as well as hiking the rocking terrain of our back yard. I've worn them both with & without sockettes, but I generally wear them bare-footed. They are breathable to the point you can feel the air pass through them as you walk. I like the roomy toe bed & that they almost literally feel like you have nothing on your feet. They are SUPER lightweight, so if you are looking for a heavy duty shoe, this one might not be the one for you with it's slim but durable sole. They also wash & dry easily (I've only hand washed).

None of my shoes that have always been so comfortable are helping at all if I have to walk for more than 30 minutes. It was suggested to try water shoes since they are flat and have good tread. I’m so glad I got these. I went shopping with my mom to put these to the test. We walked around for a few hours and my feet felt so good the entire time and didn’t swell. I wore them with socks just to make sure they were the most comfortable. I can wear them either way since they are adjustable. I got my regular size 6 1/2 and they fit perfect. These are the style with the tongue which are so much easier to get on your feet and the fact that they adjust I knew these were the style to get.
