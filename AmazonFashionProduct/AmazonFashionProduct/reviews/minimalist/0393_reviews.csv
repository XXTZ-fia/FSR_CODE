K. Taylor,I love these more than I should,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39ZA6IXR1CR3N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B06Y4Z52TR,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 27, 2021",,,"I really, really like these sunglasses, though there’s a part of me that insists I shouldn’t.  I’m usually a Ray Ban guy. I wear Classic Wayfarers most of the time, and when I want a bit of a change I have a pair of Christopher Cloos aviators and a couple of pairs of folding shades, all of them eye wateringly expensive. I really dislike the feeling of cheaply made sunglasses, and I usually avoid them like the plague. This pair of NYS feel, compared to the usual quality to which I’m accustomed, like a cheaply made pair of sunglasses.  Now don’t quote me on that. I’m not familiar with the NYS brand, but in the box there’s a card that touts the handmade nature of the glasses, boasts of the ‘highest quality materials’ used in their construction and offers a lifetime warranty, none of which suggests that these are cheaply made. They just *feel* a little cheaply made. The frames flex to a degree that doesn’t feel intentional, the hinges feel uneven (one light to close, one a little heavier), and the arms don’t sit anywhere close to flush against the frame when you close them. They also come with a soft bag rather than a hard case. All of these issues I’d expect to see on glasses I picked up for $10 at a roadside stall.  And yet, I really like these things. I love their lightness. I love the way the mirrored lenses look against the clear frames. I love the size, and the way they sit comfortably and weightlessly on my face. I don’t know of a sub-$100 pair of sunglasses I like more than these.  And I’ll go one further. When my wife saw me open the package this morning she asked me to give her a pair of sunglasses, because I have half a dozen and she only has one (don’t @ me - she destroys sunglasses as if they said something mean about her mother). She went through my collection and decided she wanted either the $60 NYS glasses or my pair of $230 Christopher Cloos aviators, and she let me pick which one I’d keep. I chose to keep the NYS and give her the expensive pair. I know I’ll regret this when she inevitably drops them in a pile of gravel before driving over them in her car within 24 hours of putting them on for the first time (seriously, I don’t know how she does it), but right now I’m happy with my decision.",2

Gunnar Vogtmann,Very Old School Style,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R213IIS6WWM79I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B06Y4Z52TR,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 9, 2021",,,Love the clear look. I don’t have a set that’s just clear plastic. I’m going to wear them for a bit to be sure they won’t cause soreness over hours of wear before I send them off to have prescription sunglasses lens installed into the frames. The hinges open and close very nicely and glide easily without any issues. They really do have a retro back in the day look to them and really ooze vintage stylish flavor.,

They look super attractive. They are a perfect fit on my larger face/head. Not tight at all, but they don’t fall off either. Super comfortable. They look exactly like the photos.
