Its high-quality construction and slim profile make it perfect for any door, allowing for easy opening and closing without any hassle. I’m particularly pleased that it stays securely in place, providing stability and safety, which is a big plus for me. What is most important to me is that it actually is UTLRA THIN so that my door can close!!! I tried so many on the market and that feature is REALLY hard to find.  However, I want to highlight that the color is not as dark as advertised; it’s more of a medium gray. While I appreciate the look, I would love to see this mat offered in a true black option. Not only does black complement any home décor beautifully, but it also does a fantastic job of hiding stains, making it more practical for everyday use.  Overall, this door mat is an excellent investment for anyone looking for a stylish and functional addition to their entryway!  5/5 stars",5

They package it by folding it. The rug has large creases in a 2 x 3 pattern. Those creatures stick up too.

The mat was rolled up and wrapped in plastic. That was then put into a shipping box. Not much risk of shipping damage unless something were to puncture or cut it.  Material Quality: The top of the mat is made of a fabric described as “simulated linen,” while the bottom is rubber.  Assembly/Build Quality: The mat seems well made. The stitching looks good and is overall assembled well.  Marketing Material: The images represent the item well and there are no signs of misrepresenting this product. The marketing material calls the top “simulated linen,” but I am not sure what it actually is. Overall it is a soft and nice looking material. There are several size to choose from as well as different colors.  Functionality: This mat is a good size and one of the things I like about it is that it is not full of creases like a lot of rugs and mats that get shipped. I get that sometimes something might need to be folded, and even though this one was rolled up I still don’t think it would crease if it was folded. The mat is very thin so it lives up to its claim of low profile. The rubber bottom does make it anti-slip which is also nice. The listing says you can wash it in a washing machine but I don’t know how well it will hold up over time like that. I believe the top material and the bottom rubber are glued together, so many turns in the washer might cause the glue to fail over time.  Price: This item is listed (at the time of this review) for $59.98. This seems awfully high for a minimalist floor mat. I cant say I agree with the price.  Likes: I like that it is light but still feels solidly made.  Dislikes: The price seems very high for what it is.  Overall: I would recommend this mat as it is a nice, good looking and useful mat, but gosh the price is high compared to similar sized floor mats. I don’t know if it is worth the price. If it lasted for years and years I would say yes, but only time will tell. If you can catch it on sale I would say get it if the price is right.",2
