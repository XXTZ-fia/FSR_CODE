It also has no way to technically ""keep"" it closed, it's a flap with no secure. For me these arent deal breakers, especially as it's materials are super high quality. It's also the only metal wallet I could find that had a hook for me to attach my chain to make it a chain wallet. I have like 5 cards in it, probably won't put more in personally. It's surprisingly lightweight for being leather and metal, but that's since it's so small, as advertised. It's not convenient to use, but I'm tired of my chain wallets ripping through the materials.",

But some parts should be noted: the rubber band is a bit too tight so putting a card and taking it out can be cumbersome. When spreading the card insert, it makes a very irritating scraping noise (although it does not damage the metal part). Applying plastic tape at each edge solves the problem nicely, but if you don't want to do this, you will constantly have a problem with the chalkboard scratching sound. The other single-card inserts are a bit too tight. Other than these couple of issues, its a pretty solid design.",
