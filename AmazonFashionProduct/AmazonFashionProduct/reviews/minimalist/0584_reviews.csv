I love the flat feeling when I walk. It's a completely different feeling from even a 1-in heel like Crocs or standard hiking shoes or boots. They're very flexible and don't overheat. When I've gotten them fully wet from walking in wet grass they dry very quickly. Your feet do get a bit dirty because you're down on the ground in the dust and dirt however. I have wide feet and a bunion and they're very comfortable to walk in. I wear them for everyday wear, to the store, walking through the neighborhood, hiking in the woods. They have thicker protection points at the ball of the foot and heel. That is helpful but you can feel larger sharp rocks through the shoe. They're so comfortable I'm considering getting a pair as a second set of house shoes. I'd highly recommend these especially if you have wide feet.",5

The cons are the right shoe pressed the top of my toenail up into the toe box which I did not like. I removed the liner/arch supports which solved that problem but now I don't have arch supports.
