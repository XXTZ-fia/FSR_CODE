They run true to size and look so expensive. I think they elevate any outfit even though they are a flip flop. They are surprisingly really comfortable- coming from someone who always gets blisters.,

They fit well and are of good quality. It’s a great value for the price. The only issue I’ve had is some pain/tenderness in between my toes. I love the style and will continue to wear them as they’re a little more chic than your average flip flop sandal.,

I really do love them very much. Because they are so simple but they're actually quite comfortable. I am pleasantly surprised because I did not expect them to be true to size, but they actually are. They are a leather but they do not get too hot in the summer either. I am glad that I can wear this with multiple outfits. Or even if I am just running. Errands out. I am glad that I ordered them. And I'm pretty happy with the packaging. Because they were individually packaged, but they came right on time.",

It’s so cute, simple and chic. Looks like it could be designer made. Sizing is true to size but if you’re in between sizes, size down. I’m normally a 7.5 or 8 and the 7.5 was perfect and 8 would have been too big.",
