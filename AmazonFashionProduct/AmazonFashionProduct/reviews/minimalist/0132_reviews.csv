ScabbyChic,"Gone, but not forgotten",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DC0ZW63ABH8R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3ZRW4D6,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 30, 2024",Size: 10Color: W63 Black/Gum,Verified Purchase,"I just retired just a after nearly a year of casual use, and my review is 99% positive. They're very comfortable, well-constructed (the soles started wearing down a couple months ago, but the uppers still look new- no tears and all the seams are as tight as the day I got them). The price is right, too- for $43, I definitely got my money's worth, and it's a great way to see if barefoot shoes are for you. This was my first pair of barefoot shoes, but adjusting to them from fat-heeled, cushy Hokas was surprisingly painless. If you plan on actually running in them, probably stick to offroad- The soles are flexible and very thin, with no cushioning: you'll definitely feel it if you pound the pavement or step on a rock. That's my only complaint, and it applies to barefoot shoes in general, not just these.  I've since purchased a couple other brands of barefoot/zero drop shoes, and where these Whitins really shine are the fit and style. Barefoot shoes should move with your feet, which these do very well- the sloes flex effortlessly and the uppers have just the right balance of padding and rigidity to lock on to my heels and stay comfortably in place through my stride. Even with thin socks, they never chaffed. I tried a different, more expensive Amazon-exclusive brand of barefoot trainers and my heel would lift nearly half-way out of them when I walked.  If you're comparison shopping, you've probably noticed that this type of shoe has a wide toe box, which tends to give them an unflattering ""clown shoe"" vibe (seller's pictures tend to show their product at only flattering angles, but if you look at user review photos, you'll see it). The model I bought-WHITIN Men's Barefoot Running Shoes | Minimalist Cross-Trainer| - is just as wide as the others, but the wrap-around soles and the placement/shape of those plastic side panels gives them a *much * slimmer appearance.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase and will definitely be getting another pair soon!",45

Dave in Texarkana,European Style and Size - Quality above average - durability too early to tell,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R198S5071I4IJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3ZRW4D6,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 20, 2024",Size: 12.5Color: W63 Brown/Gum,Verified Purchase,"Many inaccurate statements in other reviews (mostly the negative ones), so setting the record straight and providing an honest review. The hard part, of course, is that everyone has different opinions on shoes, the hardest thing to get a prevailing/standard opinion on.  The incorrect stuff - there is no tongue; yes there is, it's just affixed all the way up the opening like a hunting boot - it has hard plastic shoelace inlets; no it doesn't, it's a soft fabric backed material a little stiffer than the main upper material - there is no padding in the foot; yes there is, but it is thinner than a tennis shoe, more than a leather dress shoe (higher quality ones). It doesn't have memory foam/gel, etc. like many tennis shoes do now. -they are narrow; this is a lot subjective in the reviews, no measurements, but IMHO, they are not wide, and not really advertised like that as I saw it a few days ago. They 'feel' a little tight/different, mostly because the middle section/eyelet material is stiffer than the main shoe material which is very soft and I assume breathable. This could create a 'ridge' you'd feel if laced tight. I generally get 'hot spots' around my ankles in hunting boots, this doesn't feel like that and once broken in (if they do break in) it shouldn't be noticeable. -no heel retention; I list this as a pro below, it actually cups my heel very well, better than most tennis shoes (what wears out first besides the sole) and dress shoes until they're broken in  Pros -price - got these on Prime day for $35 which if they last (just received today) is a good deal -main material - it is very soft, shouldn't create any rubbing but for the above perceptions for some, and durability is a question, we'll see -sole - I cannot see why this would be more slippery than any other 'tennis shoe' like bottom, if they get dirty or other slippery substance on them, they may be slippery - never had a pair that wasn't in that situation - heel portion, as above cups very nice and grabs and doesn't slip like most new shoes do at first (or all the time and wear out - at least for me)  Cons -you can feel the sole through the cushion - is subjective, my BMI is harder so I feel more in my feet as far as uneven -medium width, not wide; I have wider feet, but I've had shoes too wide too - these are not 'tight' but feel a bit snug, but are also brand new, not sure how much they will 'break in'. -sizing - my feet measure 12 1/2, that's the option I picked, the sticker as you can see says 46 which is European Men's, Google AI says both a 46 is a 12 and a 45 is a 12 1/2, go figure. For me, if I stand up, my toe almost touches standing still, meaning it will rub. I put on my well broken retired tennis shoes and the distance is the same and do not hurt at all, so I assume these will be fine.  I considered sending back because they do not feel 'soft and smooth all over' like some tennis shoes do ($100 Nike/etc.), but they are intended minimalist and some talk about benefits for plantar (it's not planter folks, that's for plants or peanuts :-),) fasciitis, which I have, so I'm going to keep and try them out. All the testing was done with low ride thin athletic socks. -",40

Mark,"Great shoes, takes some time to get used to.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14UGHAWO8FBNP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3ZRW4D6,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 12, 2023",Size: 10Color: W63 All Black,Verified Purchase,"My first time using zero drop shoes. It's definitely a different experience and feeling than wearing other shoes. Used them for running and it's like running barefooted. I can actually feel the ground. My calves were burning after a run, but it felt good like they we're actually being used like they're supposed to. My feet also felt better after the run compared to using other running shoes. I didn't get blisters after running 5 miles. Felt more natural with my feet striking the ground instead of being supported by memory foam. These shoes are like wearing socks with a sole at the bottom. Definitely worth a try and for the price it's a steal. I wear a size 10 U.S, so I got the size 43. It fit perfectly snug, so if you want a little more room in the front of your toes I suggest going a size up, but if you want a snug fit buy the exact size. The material is stretchy, so even if it fits tight it will stretch. It does feel a bit tight in the beginning, but after the run I didn't even notice.  Edit: So I ripped one of the top shoe lace loop holes. This was my mistake as I pulled hard to get the shoe really tight, but in the process the rubber ripped. Just putting this note here to let others know to not pull too hard or you can rip the rubber with the shoe lace. All in all still a great shoe. I'm going to fix it with some super glue.",7
TheFoxRobin,"Good barefoot choice, but toe box is narrow.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R366R42WI8O1S3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3ZRW4D6,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 2, 2023",Size: 10Color: W63 All Black,Verified Purchase,"I like the construction on these a lot so far. I live in Hawaii, so I prefer my feet to be able to breathe. These really allow that due to the mesh design, and so they stay comfortable where other shoes I use are not. I often wear a size 44 but I've been getting 43 lately, as I did with these, and it fits great with little to no excess toe room (which I like because it makes the shoe feel snug and form fitted). I'd say they are true to size. The sole has a bit more rubber than my typical preference but again in Hawaii this is nice because I spend a lot of time on lava rocks which absolutely demolishes barefoot shoes. My only complaint is that the toe box is narrow. My feet, despite wearing barefoot for nearly a decade, remain rather narrow. So this works for me. But if you have wide feet or your toes have a healthy spread, these are going to be too narrow for you. Check the measurements and consider how you like shoes to fit. These will feel good, comfortable and breathable for most people I think, but if you know you have wider feet or a wider toe spread, just know that you're pushing it with these shoes. That being said, I would totally buy them again and recommend them.",17
Thisguy188,"Great for back, but beware goat heads and shin pain",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HRLEZ8CILWA5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3ZRW4D6,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 7, 2024",Size: 13.5Color: W63 All Black,Verified Purchase,"If you're getting a zero drop sole shoe, then these are great. The fabric is a bit elastic which helps make the shoes feel comfortable immediately out of the box. I paired them with some elastic shoe laces and they make a great slip on. They are quiet, fit right but offer no arch support. Simple warnings if you have never had barefoot shoes, the lack of cushion is, at first, very hard on your shins. You will go around a month with shin pain as your body adapts to the change. The pain is never unbearable, but it's a bone pain which is definitely unpleasant. Due to this, don't give up. The temporary shin pain is worth the eventually lack of back pain and strain. While not a perfect solution to lower back pains, the benefits of barefoot shoes and zero drop soles are very real ib my experience and have relieved years of back pain. The next part, specific to this shoe is that the sole is thin. This is intentional but something you may not realize is that it is just thin enough for longer goat heads to penetrate the sole and prick your foot. This came as a shock to me the first time I got soles these thin. If you live in an area where goat heads grow then you may want to look into some sort of sole insert that is puncture resistant. Many are sold for construction workers for protection and they are around $15-35. You are easily able to remove the included insole and replace it and I'd recommend it if you may find yourself walking in goat heads or other such spikes. While you may debate whether or not you should try barefoot shoes and zero drop soles, if you find yourself wanting to try them out then I'd recommend these ones. Good for work, good for walking and worth the money.",3

Worn roughly 4-6 days a week in that time period while at the gym. Shoes were great but I would not recommend for running. Not enough padding as I ran with my son for a fun raiser. The comfort was great seemed durably but the final straw to have to retire these were the outside rubber piece broke (the part that holds the laces) not sure from over use or what. I would buy these again but want something with a bit more absorbing power for when I run.,

I bought them as an inexpensive introduction to barefoot shoes.  So far, they are durable enough.  Most of my use has been on a treadmill.

I have been using the same pair of shoes for almost every day use for 2+ years straight. So here is what I will summarize to keep the journey concise:  The Cons: - The insole fell out and wore out within the first 6 months if I remember correctly. Eventually I just pulled it out and went on like that. - The tread on the shoes also wore out very quickly, with most of it gone also within the first year or 6 months. I used these shoes for playing soccer, and also going to work everyday where I stood on a concrete smooth ground. - The tread now is like paper thin and I am honestly surprised I don't have any holes officially showing. - Don't step in any puddles with these shoes, they get wet easily! Good thing is they can also dry kind of fast, but overall not comfortable getting wet with.  Pros: - Its a barefoot shoe so expect a barefoot experience (which I am a fan of now because I have wide flat feet) - These shoes are SUPER comfortable when you first put them on and have great traction! - I love the elastic all around that feels like a nice hug on my feet all the time without limiting my movement in anyway. - No pinching ever noticed with these shoes they are great for parkour too if you are into that.  Overall: I think its worth the price considering how I abused these shoes for 2 years. However I would love to see some durability improvements to really make this good to recommend to friends. They need a better sole compound overall that will help it last longer.  Hope this helps.",

If you’re new to bare foot shoes, be aware that they take a bit of adjustment, as you can feel the surface beneath you with each step. The sole is thinner than you're typical shoe, they’re great for everyday walking on level surfaces. However, if you’re planning on walking over rocks, stones, or rougher terrain, be prepared for a bit more impact on your feet due to the thinner sole. While I can’t compare them directly to other barefoot shoes, the sole thickness is definitely something to keep in mind.

The internal adhesives for the cheap foam insert disintegrated, and the soles fail to protect from even small spiky dandelions (sowthistle) you encounter on the sidewalk. I received this as a loving gift and I despise them, my first pair of vapor glove 3s have spent thousands of more hours on my feet and have held up far more, these whitins are the worst barefoot shoes I own.

They were great wide toe box shoes, and the fit was perfect. They took some getting used to because you still feel rocks and things due to a thin sole, but mostly that’s fine. On occasion it can be a little pokey. They are SUPER slippery on wet rocks or tile, in the grocery store even.  Now for some reason the color of the rubber on the bottom this time is almost pink instead of tan. (I have the black and “gum” color) They are definitely much less sleek with that pinkish tint  In my pictures you can see my first shoe (granted, worn and dirty) is more tan (especially on the side where it’s more original color) rather than the new shoes which are reddish pink?  The wide toe box is basically non existent on the new pair. It really rubbed on my pinky toe. There should not be a period of “breaking them in” with wide toe box shoes— so I’m sending them back. In my picture you can see my old shoe on the right is much wider. Thats how they should be. Overall— disappointing because they were shoes I would have bought over and over again until the design changes.",
