Alyssa Harris,Cute but can’t put on,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CROI6C29Q6CO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB47WYWX,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Color: 04.Apr-Diamond-Silver,Verified Purchase,These would’ve looked so cute on but part you put through your ear is so short that I can’t even put them on.,
Dave H,nice earrings,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AIMA9GU7042I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB47WYWX,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Color: 04.Apr-Diamond-14K Gold,,Good quality. Easy to put on and take off. Stay on and closed. Do take a couple of days to get adjusted to so I would question the quality of the gold. Very pretty. Big but not too big.,
Cindy,"Won’t even fit, couldn’t get it on",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24QZAD8NL5IZ0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB47WYWX,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 15, 2024",Color: 04.Apr-Diamond-14K Gold,Verified Purchase,"I wanted to love these pieces so bad because they are really pretty. However, the way that the product is designed is flawed and won’t allow you to fit it in your lobes if they are thicker. Normally, posts are designed in a way where they are longer with the stud, and the flat back is shorter. This was vice versa and didn’t make any sense.",2
Goforth,"Pretty, but color is off",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2W4O6PYWLNV1O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB47WYWX,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 4, 2024",Color: 07.Jul-Ruby-Silver,,"These are nice earrings, seem well made. My only issue is that July is not orange. The color doesn't match the month selected. Can't speak to the others.",

I really like it!  I picked these out for my daughter and I may have to go back and get a set for myself now!  The front part, that you see, is so cute and delicate.  The backs are nice and secure, which makes me happier that my daughter won't lose them at school.  She has already asked me to look at the company for more styles!  Also, delivery was nice and quick!Thank you for the item, this is my honest opinion.",
Beth Y.,Holds secure and are super cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM8IDOUAORAAQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB47WYWX,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 26, 2024",Color: 12.Dec-Tanzanite-Silver,,"These are super cute!  I put them in before bed and they were securely held overnight.  My only complaint is the ones with the dangle are a little bit harder to grip due to that but otherwise, I was able to tighten them well.  I am typically very sensitive to different metals and so far so good, no issues with these.",

Brians (Vine Voice),Extended Thread Design for Security,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31DR6RACCN42/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB47WYWX,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 29, 2024",Color: 04.Apr-Diamond-14K Gold,,"One of the best things about these earrings is the extended internal thread, which makes them much easier to screw on and keeps them securely in place.  I’ve had studs in the past that constantly loosen or fall off, but these have stayed put, even during exercise and sleep.  The design makes me feel confident that they won’t slip off or get lost, which is such a relief for anyone with an active lifestyle.  This feature alone makes them worth it, especially if you tend to wear your earrings 24/7.  My only minor wish is that the backing could be a bit thinner to feel less noticeable, but overall, the comfort and security are fantastic.""",
Frank,High-Quality Construction,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17C9LTVXZKSB1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB47WYWX,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 29, 2024",Color: 04.Apr-Diamond-14K Gold,,"The craftsmanship on these earrings is really impressive! The gold plating is even and looks very professional. Each stone is securely set with no wobble or looseness. Love how the flat backs are perfectly smooth with no rough edges. The threading is precise and well-machined. Really appreciate the attention to detail in the finish work. The posts are sturdy but not too thick. The birthstone colors are vibrant and true to what you'd expect. """,
Scott E,I love these so so much,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLEZCV7T2TE8R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB47WYWX,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 14, 2024",Color: 05.May-Emerald-Silver,,"These are the cutest, most dainty, adorable, and quality earrings. Normally, it costs a whole lot more to have a threaded earring such as these. The design is so cute and the 3 pairs go together really well. They are really comfortable and I can't sleep in them without worry, same with showering. These are easy to put on, it does take some trial and error, but once they're in they are IN. Not only are the earrings so perfect, the packaging was adorable and they even added a little note which absolutely melted me. I would 1000% recommend and I really hope they start putting out styles in gold too!",
Lupe,Bar length,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30SNGOWV42ZZO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB47WYWX,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 11, 2024",Color: 04.Apr-Diamond-Silver,,"These flat back earrings have a sleek and modern design, but the bar length is notably long. This extended length causes the earrings to dangle slightly outward, which might not suit everyone's style preference. The overall quality is good, and they are comfortable to wear for extended periods. However, if you prefer a more snug fit against the earlobe, you might find this design a bit too long.",2
ashish,Painfree but a little touch to put on!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QQJF2XLD2IL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB47WYWX,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 11, 2024",Color: 08.Aug-Peridot-Silver,,"The earrings are really nice!  I've only worn them for under a week, so the quality is hard to speak to, but so far, the flat backs have been really nice when laying on my side to read or sleep.  As opposed to the conventional long post in the front of the earring, these posts are smaller in the front and longer from the back and screw into each other.  They're secure, but having a magnifying mirror or a friend help with putting them on initially was helpful.  I'd order different types of these for sure, especially if you have multiple piercings and want to create a look.",
Voracious Reader,Nice Set for Stacked Piercings,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHCI0Z6GECGH2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB47WYWX,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 10, 2024",Color: 11.Nov-Gitrine-Silver,,This is a nice set of internally screwed flat back earrings.
