More cushion then I thought therw would be as well so they are very comfortable.  I loke that they have a heel cup. I think a chubby foot wouldn't work so well with the heel cup though. All in all they are a great sandal. Definitely a keeper with some adjustments made but they are made to be adjustable so that's awesome!! 👌,3

Seeing that these were whole sizes, I ventured into the territory of ordering a size seven and eight to compare the fit.  The size 7 ended up being close to perfect.  The eights were a bit too loose with more of the laces hanging a bit when adjusted correctly for my feet.  I walked around a bit in both to test them, and the size 8 offered a bit less control; I also felt a bit of flopping during the trial run.  The size 7 fits my foot almost exactly with a little room to tighten or loosen the laces for more or less control with no flopping in either setting for me.  Soooo…. I think I’m going to send the 8 back and keep the 7… much to my surprise :) These are just great shoes!

Pros - very adjustable - super lightweight - easy to pack and dries quickly - decent traction on dry surfaces - seem pretty durable - comfortable  Cons - uber slippery on wet asphalt and tile - the toe strap anchor should be further back which causes my foot to slide too far forward to where my toes almost hang off - price seems steep compared to some cheapy flat sandals from Target that I wore daily in the summer months for the last 7 years - can't get them right enough to actual hiking in them (maybe my foot is too thin?)  Overall I'd recommend them, especially if they're on sale. I plan to keep wearing them until they explode as they work well for the office, lunch walks, and travel.",12

It took me about 10 minutes to adjust both of them to fit my feet perfectly. 10 minutes that will pay off until these puppies are falling apart. The sole is absolutely amazing - so flexible and responsive, truly like wearing nothing. And the ankle strap rides low enough that my cranky inner ankle bone isn’t bothered at all, yet it’s very secure on my foot. It’s a completely flat sole, there is no arch support of any kind, which is exactly what my foot needs to be happy. And here’s the kicker…they’re CUTE! I thought the plastic tabs at the ends of the strap would look clunky or feel weird against the back of my foot, but neither is the case, I can’t tell they're there at all. And while it gives my toes plenty of space they’re not so big that they look weird at all. Thank you Xero!",8

Funny story- first order I literally recieved ONE shoe. They resent a new pair quickly.  The color of these is great and the fit is customizable with the adjustments on the straps. The flex is incredible and I've been wearing them non stop since the day I got them (well, the PAIR of them) and have had no adjustment time. To be fair, I spend a lot of time barefoot, but not in my shopping, driving and other things outside the property. I had yoga mat style shoes for years that were flexible and quite cushiony. When those wore out, I stuck with some basic flipflops - horrible for foot health I know. So these were a welcome surprise as how wonderful they felt from the start. I can comfortably wear my toe spacers in them when I want as well.  The sole is flexible, and thin. There is a small amount of cushion- very small. They are also thin enough that the ""goat-head"" seed thorns in the area (as they are called) can go through, which is just an unpleasant aspect of where we live, not an issue with the shoe and its still worth wearing them.  These are my first Xero shoes and I am prepared to buy others. Definitely recommend!",3

I know, I know, they're barefoot, they're supposed to be flexible! But I find with these I catch the toe regularly and it feels like it's folding under.  The multi adjustment places are a great feature, although I do find that the knots can apply pressure directly below them after a short while. Makes me want to kick them off to be barefoot as soon as I can!  I also do not feel comfortable driving in them.
