They're well designed. I wore my last pair every day (navy with white soles), the leather tops still look fabulous and even in shallow puddles and rainy weather my feet never get wet. I'm hard on my shoes, the soles are tread bare in places but I'll still wear them for months to come, they're still comfortable. I purchased this pair because it's the first pair of black with black soles, so they'll work great for more formal attire. ""Zero Drop Forever!""",

I purchased these because I wanted something to wear to work and not always have to wear ""athletic-looking"" shoes. The sizing I found was perfectly in line with others I have bought. I just received them and have only worn them around the house, but I find them very comfortable so far, and the memory foam insole is an amazing touch! I love how they look, NOT clown shoes at all (regular pointed-toe shoes are clown shoes in my opinion). The top of the shoe/a light leather is not tight and binding giving feet some flexibility (for those with bunions etc). I hope the quality, in time, matches my initial opinion but at this price point, I WILL be buying more pairs in different colors!",

The shoes are comfortable but very wide which I suppose should be expected since they are listed as WIDE shoes. If I had ordered the proper size for my foot I may be tempted to keep them as casual run around shoes because I can tell they would be quite nice to wear, however, I won’t be replacing these with the proper size because I wanted real leather and these are 100% NOT leather. I didn’t expect full grain perfectly thick and amazing leather, but to advertise them as leather and be delivered as faux leather is a disappointment. I hope one day false advertising is punished, but I won’t hold my breath. If the genuine leather aspect doesn’t bother you, and you get the proper size for your foot length, these will likely be a lovely “minimalist/barefoot” style shoe on a budget.",4

So I ordered a 'leather' hobibear in black in hopes that I could pass it off as a dress shoe. I removed the terrible hobibear tag and swapped out the laces for a dresser combination. Is it tux worthy? No. Will it work for a tie leaning business office? Yes.  Compared to my xero mesa trails the shoes share similar foot boxes. The xero has no lift on the edge towards the front of the shoe while the hobibear do lift up a bit and point the toes upward. It isn't comfortable or natural.  The quality is mediocre, I question if this is real leather and based on how much my feet sweet compared to comparable Clark leather shoes...

I will keep them for rainy days and update on the waterproof claim but I couldn't wear these daily.,

I've worn wide toe box shoes by Keen, two pairs of Xero Prios, and Xero Glenns, and these have the best fit out of all of them while costing roughly half the price.  Fit  The toe box is wide enough for a full toe splay, but not too wide as to get in the way and feel like it's not still an extension of the foot. Equally as important, the midfoot and heel fit nice and snug and follow the shape of a normal foot. The Xero Glenns for example have far too much width in the midfoot and heel and my feet move around uncomfortably in the shoe.  Sizing  The size feels like it runs slightly less than half a size too big, but I wear them with only one pair of socks with my size 13 and fairly average proportioned feet, and feel comfortable. An extra pair of socks may be better for some.  Finish  The finish is also a plus as it holds a proper formal shine, unlike the Xero Glenns which are a dull matte.  Bear in mind these are zero drop barefoot shoes so they can be uncomfortable standing on hard urban surfaces for long periods of time. I've been standing/walking all day for years, and wearing barefoot shoes all day for a little over a year, so my feet are pretty tough, but I'll still rotate to normal sole shoes throughout the week. If Hobibear made wide toe box shoes with this fit but a thicker sole I'd buy them in a heartbeat.  Durability  It is still early to tell, but so far no visible wear has been found on these shoes, and I've had a pair of Xero Prios start to tear on the seam after only about 2-3 months so they're already beating the competition that I've tried.  Conclusion  Excellent fit and finish shoe if you enjoy the feeling of walking barefoot with your toes set free while still looking stylish enough for any casual or formal setting.",28

I think part of it definitely stems from the fact that these shoes have a large toebox. It is very nice to be able to comfortably wiggle my toes in my shoes and not have my toes and ball of my foot feel constricted in anyway. The shoes are leather, and are unisex style, which I personally find great because I wear a large shoe size that is not always available in every women’s style shoe. I’m not a huge fan of black shoes with a white sole, and I’m also not a fan of black shoes with black soles, but for the comfort of these, I will make an exception to that rule. When I wear black shoes, usually, they are loafer style or black flats that go more with work type clothes. These shoes I have found I can lace them and slip in and out of them after tying them that first time. These really are great shoes, very comfortable.

They are my go to shoe.  Above HOKA, New Balance, etc.  My feet do not get as tired, they are getting stronger, and I love the way they look.  I wish they had more designs or colors.  I hope they don't raise their prices also.  Yes you will feel rocks if you walk on them however they will not hurt and you can continue to walk on rocks.  You really should give them a try.  I find I am wearing them around the house also. They PREVENT slipping or stumbling as they adhear to the surface.  I love that over any squishy bouncy feeling like I may fall.  I found the soft comfort of the high ebd sport shoes did more damage then good.After reading many negative and positive reviews along with comparing to a completely different Zero Drop Shoe I decided on trying this one. Like others said, it's so cheap I'm not loosing anything by trying it.  I think if this had cost like $150 - $200 for the shoes I wouldn't have been so skeptical.  I was completely taken back after putting them on and walking around the room.  Thinking this won't last long, let me go on a long walk and see when the pain kicks in.  I walked my Dog about 1 1/2 hours. No Pain & feet felt great afterwards.  I wore them out shopping the next day and kept them on around the house they were so comfortable. The next week I experimented doing differeent walks, standing in KItchen cooking, just daily routine type of stuff.  I just couldn't believe it.  The cost is minimal.  The look you either hate it or you love it.  I love the wide toe look and reminds me a little of Clown Shoes.I have several foot issues in which my feet hurt after a few hours on them.  I even tried a pair of brand name ""Orthofeet"" which were soooo comfy and squishy which made me feel like I was loosing my balance swaying back and forth.  I also have one leg 1 inch shorter after a Hip Operation.  I purchased many brands trying to get something comfortable while at the same time Stable.  New Balance, Sketchers, Saucomy, OnCloud, Ryka and Reebok.  They all felt comfy but not stable on my feet.The HobiBare did it all.  Very minimal inserts but really really good ones.  You feel oh so comfortable when walking in them while at same time feel like your hugging the road or grounded.  No, you don't feel anything when walking on rocks except the rocks maybe wobbly.  You can feel your walking on rocks though it doesn't hurt or uncomfortable.  The Bottoms of the Shoe have a superior grip material walking on just about any material.  There were a few times it felt my foot was stuck on the floor a bit and then released.  I read someone went slipping and slidding in a commercial kitchen.  I can only imgaine that to be true if Oil were on the floor.  That would cause slipping.  Even my shorter leg doesn't bother me as much in these shoes as my back doesn't hurt as bad when walking either.  I have a truly horrible back and have had 3 operation and many epidurals so when I say my back does not hurt when I am walking, I truly mean it.  Now I don't know if that will last but for now I will take it.I am getting another pair in another color.  If they give out or glue doesn't hold up long they are so inexpensive you just get another.  I certainly recommend this shoes.",28

I'll start by saying I wear a women's 11 (and looking at barefoot shoe websites also an extra wide) so most shoes look like clown shoes on me. These are no exception but no worse than other shoes. Actually, they're kind of cute!  And comfort? I'm not exaggerating when I say this is the most comfortable shoe I've ever put on my foot. No break in time, excellent comfort, breathable (which was a real surprise considering they're water resistant!), and my foot doesn't run anywhere in this shoe! There is also a very slight cush to the heel that feels great.  I wore than 9+ hours at work the second day I got them. I run a car wash, so comfort on concrete and anti-slip is vital. These things had more grip on the wet, soapy floors than my Caterpillar slip resistant work boots! And my feet stayed dry and comfy all day!  My second job is in a pizza place, so the requirements of water resistant and slip proof are necessary for both, and they were phenomenal on the greasy tile floors as well.  This was a perfect introductory shoe to the barefoot world and I highly recommend trying these! No pain, no discomfort, no soreness.

Could honestly be even a touch wider, I'd say it's similar to Altra's regular fit (not wide/OG) fit. No complaints given the cheap price. Materials and construction are better than expected given the price.",

Some random person,"pretty comfy, but I wish they came a little farther up my ankels",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU7PSVF4SS4AI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKHP52WH,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 24, 2024",Size: 10.5 Wide Women/8.5 Wide MenColor: All Black,Verified Purchase,"for the most part they feel like walking around in socks.  The toe boxes are pretty wide. I was starting to get a bunion, so Im trying to permanently nip that in the bud before it gets any worse. As I stated un the title, the shose sits kind of low around the ankle, and the tongue is kind of short. The piping around the edge digs into my skin when I wear low-cut socks with these.",
