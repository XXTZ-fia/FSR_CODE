Marisela Ochoa,True to size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPSTDXEEWZ3GF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GFYX43,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Size: 10.5 Wide Little KidColor: W8k9 | Black Multi,Verified Purchase,"OMG!! I loved the shoes, they are true to size I did get another pair because they fit perfect. I got a size 10.5 and I just bought another pair in size 11. I can't wait to get them. Fits my Son's wide little feet. I'm so happy I came across these shoes. I'm planning to purchase all colors and all the sizes my Son needs. If you have a Baby that has wide feet. I Highly recommend to purchase WHITIN Toddler/Little Kids Wide Toe Box Barefoot Shoes + Minimalist Sneakers for Boys Girls. Really happy with the purchase.",

Jengi,Nice wide toe box,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R235WWFGFZZ2E1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GFYX43,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Size: 8 Wide ToddlerColor: W8k9 | Grey Gum,Verified Purchase,"These shoes are adorable and have a nice wide toe box. My only complaint is that it's very hard for my child to put them on and take them off. It's very tight around the heel area which is nice for when they're running around, but we encourage Independence in this house and my little doesn't have the strength to take off the shoe as she can with other shoes.",

These shoes have a big toe box and the issues went away. They are a more natural fit of how feet should be. We will not be wearing “normal” small toe box shoes any longer.",

Courtenay,Great for toddlers!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2E3NE2UZ2WF0G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GFYX43,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Size: 7 Wide ToddlerColor: W8k9 | Grey Gum,Verified Purchase,"I probably bought and returned at least 6 pairs of shoes before finding one that fit my 19 month old son’s feet right! He has super wide feet and a wide toe splay, but his instep isn’t that high. New Balance was either too wide at the opening or too narrow at the toe (or both) and stride rite was sold out in all the XW styles I liked. These fit so well, have great slip resistance, are flexible, and seem like good quality. My son never tries to take them off and wears them all day at daycare with no problems. I’m so happy!",
