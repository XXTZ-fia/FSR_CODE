One problem, that isn't necessarily fault of the wallet butbof the general pitfalls of this style. Over time (and somewhat quickly on the ""printed"" ones) it will destroy credit cards. The chips work fine, but the mag strip and any printed on writing on most CCs will get destroyed from rubbing against other cards in here. For several years I made sure to keep another card with mo embossed lettering in between cards as a buffer (such as a license or something between bank cards) but even still the friction/abrasion of sliding them against eachother will eventually rub off the mag strip and printing enough that it will no longer be legible or work anywhere without a chip reader or nfc.

It’s not always THE most convenient if you’re fumbling around for the third card deep, but it’s no big deal to slide them all out to the edge and grab what you need. 90% of the time you are using one of about two or three cards, which you simply keep on the outside of the stack. And yes, the rubber band can hold cash or an additional card outside.

Man I wish I had just gotten a regular ole ""Ridge"" style card holder wallet with the money clip instead of this piece of garbage... It is quite literally, two molded pieces of plastic, with an unsecured silicone, or some such rubber material, band that wraps around the two pieces of plastic, and just sits inside a channel in the pieces of plastic. Nothing to secure the band and hold it in place when you have your cards out of the wallet or if you only need to carry around 2-3 cards... You need to have a minium of at LEAST 4 cards, proper credit cards or driver's licenses/IDs in order to keep the silicone band tight enough to not slip off or let your cards slide out of the wallet.. Item is packaged with a pretty thick piece of foam/cardboard/plastic board, cant remember the exact material to ""simulate cards being held by the wallet"". As a kind of ""here's what this wallet can do"" deal. But honestly, my suspicion is that these wallets, or at least the product run/lot of wallets that mine was a part of, was paired with a silicone band that was too large. So being that the band isn't tight enough to hold the two pieces of plastic together decently, what so ever, without something between them, they cut out some cheap spacers and popped em in there to ship with it...  if I hadn't tossed away the packaging for this wallet, I would have opted to return it, even though it's only a $12 or so wallet. Because I'm that disappointed in this piece of garbage...  Seriously, please do beware... But if you have a whole whopping load of cards to hold or will always have cash to stick under the band and keep it tight, and don't mind that the band isn't secured at all, and there's only two sides where the band crosses to the other plastic bit to hold your cards from slipping out, by all means, pick this piece of junk up. lol",

It is a plastic wallet with a silcone band.  I will be returning the radix as it couldnt compare to the roco slim wallet.Ive had a competitors product for years and the silicone is starting to wear out on it.  It is the Roco slim wallet, but unfortunately they have changed their original design which looks more like the radix.  The differences from the current radix and the old roco are as follows:1. Material. The roco is aluminum so very stiff, the radix is plastic. Strong plastic, but it does bend when you try.  It shouldn't be a huge issue, but the metal will be much more durable and protect plastic cards from deforming or cracking like they can in a traditional cloth/leather wallet.  Unsure of the durability of the radixs durability longterm. The roco has worn down some of the paint over the years, but no damage, bending, cracks, anything. Extremely durable and wish i could just get a replacement band for it.Material also goes into the ""stickiness"" of the cards. With the metal wallet, it seems the cards slide along it much easier and dont stick to the wallet allowing you to access you cards easier as well.2. side cutout. The cutout on the radix is more shallow, meaning it doesnt cut in as much. When you try and remove cards, it gives your fingers much less purchase and makes it more difficult to get your cards than on the roco.  Both pushing from one side, and pulling from the other, its just overall more difficult with the radix.3.  Band.  The radix has a bump on one side supposedly to allow your finger to grasp it and pull it up easier so you can put money between the band and wallet.  If i ever put cash in it, i would put it under the wallet anyways and not between it and the band, maybe with the larger cutout it was easier to access, but bills loose make it more visible, and they can catch on stuff much easier, even being ripped out from just going in and out of the pocket.  Also the radix band is not a uniform thickness band, but has an almost rectangular shape with formed ""edges"" to make it slot into a certain spot around the wallet.  When you stack up more than 4 or so cards, its thicker than the band is created so the corners are out of place anyways creating a stress point. With a uniform band, like on the roco, you can continually rotate the band so it doesnt get fatigued on a certain spot.The radix one is a good wallet, but I found the original roco to be far superior in design.  Unfortunately they changed their design and i will have to see how the new roco compares.",2

It’s amazing how well it stayed together seeing how its alot cheaper than most slim wallets out there.  I just cleaned it out and dumped a bunch of old cards. So before these pictures, it was almost twice as thick! Thats why I had to reinforce the band with one of those rubber wristbands u get everywhere.  I never really held cash in it just because I never used cash and i was scared it wouldn’t hold well but seeing how after i stretched its band out so much along with my green band, and took alot of cards out — it holds about 5-6 bills really securely. Although i dont think it would hold a less than tht very well (unless its new).  I took all the cards out and tried to hold just a few but it wouldnt, but again mine is 5 years old. I noticed the more cards it holds the tighter the hold gets. But theres a sweetspot — about 8-10 cards, once i reached 14+ it would come apart in my back pocket.  I like to keep the cardboard spaceholder thing that comes with the wallet as a divider, between my ID cards and money cards. Also it serves to make the wallet tighter.  I just found out I could buy replacement bands for $6 a pair, and since the plastic parts are still looking new i figured i didnt need to buy a whole new wallet.

First one is still in great condition and can hold all my cards but I wanted another to just hold license and like 3 cards I use all the time. The old one now holds my extra crap I may need. For the price, you really can’t go wrong with this. And it helps me avoid having the Constanta wallet from Seinfeld.",
