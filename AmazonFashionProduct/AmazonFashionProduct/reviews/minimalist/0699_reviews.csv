Mark A. Baker,Just As Described. Good Quality Leather. Very Compact.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11Y492H329WN9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRB2G42X,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 28, 2024",Color: Style 4,,"It's the thinnest wallet I've had, which is the point. Good quality leather and stitching. There is no pocket for cash like a typical billfold. It's not a problem for me because I hardly ever carry cash. Very comfortable. It gets as think as the number of cards you have loaded. Good value. Recommended.",
BeGe,Well made,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FTZHWKVGRAK1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRB2G42X,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 23, 2024",Color: Style 4,,"This is well made. I like it well enough, but really I'm not sold that this is much thinner than a normal wallet. Once you put all the cards in it's not much different. I'm not giving guff to the product itself, more the concept. I just don't think you really save much over a normal wallet. So it loses a star for the implication that you will.  BUT that said, if this is the style of ""wallet"" you're looking for then this one is a perfectly good option.",
bc181700,"As described, but stiff, difficult to insert cards... not great quality.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R391YFJT6SZAZN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRB2G42X,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 22, 2024",Color: Style 4,,"I am aware of the price point, but this is less than stellar quality. It feels ok, but it's really stiff, the slots are so tight I can only fit 1 business card in each. I wanted to like this a lot more, but it's just not what I'm looking for. Pay an extra $10 and get something that is more traditional leather.",
Amber,Leather wallet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R195B0KT8KNJ66/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRB2G42X,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2024",Color: Style 4,,This is a great uni-sex slim wallet. I use it in my clear stadium bags to protect my card info and my husband uses it when he doesn't want to bring his designer wallet to outings. Nice quality and plenty of space for cards.,
Robin,"Okay as a thin card holder, not so great as a wallet",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34HCC6LCJOTM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRB2G42X,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 28, 2024",Color: Style 4,,"If you just need a thin holder for your credit cards (6 slots which hold 1 or 2 each), this is OK. But it's lacking RFID blocking, which is surprising as I view this as important.  I was hoping to replace my old, similar, thin wallet which is starting to wear out, but this one doesn't have the additional pockets I need to organize small paper items like my Soc Sec card, auto insurance card, medical insurance cards, etc.  I love thin wallets like this and will never go back to a flat bifold, but there are better designs available, with see-through drivers license slot, RFID blocking, multiple deeper pockets for currency and other paper items.  Also, this one seems way overpriced.",
EC,Card Holder Handmade Leather Genuine Full Grain Leather Wallet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FNQUAGMWARUM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRB2G42X,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 16, 2024",Color: Style 4,,"Looks nice, material is soft and slides into pockets easily.  Black color is soft and pretty.  It has card slots on both sides, but the wallet is too thin, there’s no way you’ll be able to fill it with cards and easily be able to remove them when you need them.  There is a top slot also, which is nice to stash some cash in.",
Frank T.,I hate fat wallets.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VCE2BZUQJ01K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRB2G42X,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 16, 2024",Color: Style 4,,"I have always carried cash in a front pocket but my credit cards and driver's license are safe in my back pocket. This wallet is so thin yet has seven slots for cards. I don't even feel it in my pocket. Made of sturdy leather, it should last a long time.",
