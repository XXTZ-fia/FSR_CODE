I usually have a size 10 and most with most brands that size is perfect. With these shoes, however, I wish I could have gotten half a size up because they are definitely on the tighter side.  The material seems to be decent and the hands-off slip-in definitely works well.  We'll say how these will hold up during further use.  The pricing below $30 would be better, which is why I am giving 4 stars for now.",

These barefoot zero-drop shoes are good for me during squats and deadlifts where I really need to feel out ground and find the right balance or posture. I don't use these for running or walking so I'm not sure how well they'd perform for cardio-based exercises. Quality is great with these. The gum sole and the intersection edge between it and the fabric upper has lasted 3 months so far without sides of splitting or degrading. Stitching is clean and tidy. They're comfortable as well. overally, highly recommended.",

JM,The Perfect Blend of Comfort and Functionality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RH75B035XVE2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK8H1GRD,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 4, 2024",Size: 11.5 Wide Women/10 Wide MenColor: All Black,,"As a personal trainer and competitive bodybuilder, I’m always looking for gear that supports my active lifestyle, and the BUHCFBO Barefoot Shoes have quickly become a staple in my gym bag. I wear a size ten wide men’s shoe, and the fit was perfect right out of the box. The wide toe box is a game-changer, letting my toes spread naturally during lifts and runs, making a noticeable difference in my balance and stability.  These shoes are as minimalist as they come, but they don’t skimp on comfort. The zero-drop sole gives me a grounded, natural feel, whether trail running, deadlifts or even walking Zeke, my lab/shepherd mix, on our favorite North Carolina trails. They’re lightweight and breathable, so I don’t feel bogged down during intense workouts or long hikes. The all-black design is sleek and versatile—I’ve even worn them for casual outings.  What surprised me most is how these shoes make you feel more connected to the ground. Whether doing squats or practicing balance drills, I feel more in control and less restricted than traditional sneakers. If you’re ready to try something new for your workouts, these are worth every penny. Just be prepared for everyone at the gym to ask about them—they’re that unique!",

They’re incredibly comfortable, and the insole/heel pad feels fantastic—it's made of bouncy foam with small bumps that give my feet a nice massage. I mostly wear them without socks, and I love the sensation. The toe box is spacious, just as advertised, giving my foot plenty of room without feeling too loose. I usually wear a size 9.5 in regular shoes but ordered a size 9, which fits perfectly. While the shoes claim to be ""EASY ON/OFF"" with ""no-tie laces,"" I still have to untie and tie them, but the out-turned collar does make it easier than my previous shoes. Lastly, I think the grey color looks classy, and there are great color options available. Overall, I’m very pleased with these shoes!",

At $30 I more or less expect disposable sneakers, but they don’t match the description particularly well. Firstly they most certainly have laces that need to be tied, so they are not just easy on off with no tying as stated in the description. Secondly, I wouldn’t call these minimalist barefoot type running shoes. While they do have a relatively thin sole and very little support, they are still much thicker than true barefoot shoes. So they’re probably worth the money they cost, and the shoes aren’t uncomfortable - they’re just not the kind of shoes I was expecting.  As regular laced shoes that need to be tied, they are soft, flexible, breathable, and will protect your feet. They’re just not especially comfortable and there is nothing special about them. “Meh” is how I would sum up these shoes.",

The toe box is also bigger as advertised and feels like a good amount of space for my foot but without too much wiggle room. I usually have worn size 9.5 in regular shoes, but I ordered a size 9 and it fits well. The shoes claim to be ""EASY ON/OFF"" with ""no-tie laces"" these are a bit of a stretch.

I have previously worn barefoot shoes so I didn't have a long adjustment period to these shoes. I just needed to get them to wear/crease in the right places for when my foot bent. Now they are comfortable. I do not see how they claim they are no-tie laces and easy to slip in/out. If I had them loose enough to slip my foot in or out, they wouldn't stay on my feet. I wasn't looking for that feature, so I'm fine with that. These have a bit of a thicker sole than my last pair of barefoot shoes and I am glad for that. I don't feel ever single twig and pebble on the ground with these! I love the zero drop soles.",

The insole is flat without feeling too thin, so the support is there as well. The soles are a durable rubber and the uppers a substantial canvas. Deducting a star only because I ordered size 11 which is a match for every other pair of shoes I own, but these could use extra length. Suggest going with one-half size up.",

Shoe has a different feel, it's heavier, and less flexible, the material is much thicker, and the lacing panels are set wider than most which means that if you tighten the lace then the material over the toe box wrinkles up.

Lightweight, breathable with some heels support (no arch support) and wide, they fit as true with some room for sure.  The heel padding helps with impact so it is not truly barefoot which is great because it's not that healthy for posture.  These will become my lounging, going on the outdoor deck shoes.",

The minimalist sole definitely captures the feeling of being barefoot and was a nice change from my usual sneakers. They have a slightly cushioned insole which was a nice addition. Overall, the shoes seem reasonably well made and the color was expected. The downside is they truly are wide toe as described. While I expected a slightly more generous front, these are almost too large. They look like clown shoes and would be embarrassing to wear in public. I unfortunately can't get past the appearance to want to wear them more.",

Jack's Facts ... and Opinion,These BUHCFBO Unisex Wide Toe Barefoot Shoes are exactly as described and seem to fit to size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NHSMAW2TZ9LM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK8H1GRD,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 31, 2024",Size: 12.5 Wide Women/11 Wide MenColor: Navy Blue,,"These BUHCFBO Unisex Wide Toe Barefoot Shoes are exactly as described and seem to fit to size.  And while I will describe a few things I don't like about them, I will not be deducting any points because the description was perfectly clear as to what I would be receiving.  I ordered these wide toe shoes with the single express purpose of wearing them around the house because I don't really like slippers.  Being able to easily put them on and having lots of toe room were my primary concerns.  But I would almost never wear them out of the house unless it was on fire, because they are completely devoid of any style, from the fabric to the soles.  I feel like a cartoon character that rhymes like ""Rickey House"" when I'm wearing them.  Though they are indeed perfectly suited for what I wanted them for - to wear them around the house where no one can ever see me in them except my family.",

My first reaction when I saw them was that I thought they were going to look odd when I wore them because the toes are so rounded but they actually look really good when they're on.  These are the first shoes I've had in a while that I put on and didn't want to take off at all and wore them all day. The insoles feel like a healing mat, like the ones you put in front of a kitchen sink, but in the best possible way.  I have an ongoing foot injury and these have done wonders to help my foot feel better. I also really like the style of these, I'm a fan of the gum with rubber black uppers. I don't know how they will stand up over time but for now they're great. Also, the shoelaces stay laced all day but I can easily slip the shoes on and off without having to untie them.",

They are a wide fit, but I believe that is intentional and the laces will snug them to your foot.  The shoes are very comfortable, but I quickly learned from walking on concrete and a driveway surfaced with coarse gravel that there is very little cushioning under your foot.  I could almost count the rocks under my foot and my heels struck hard on a concrete floor.  Walking on softer surfaces they are very comfortable and I expect to wear them often, but I will think about what I will be walking on before slipping them on.",
