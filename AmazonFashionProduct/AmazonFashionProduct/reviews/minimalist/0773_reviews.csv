LeslyM,Size and style matter story (short version at end),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8CKR0QJ7GJ2L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DH9685JF,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Team Name: HFS llSize: 8Color: Reflecting Pond,Verified Purchase,"I have a pair of these already and really like everything about them except they are too big. Enough that I figured a half size down would be perfect. But, I thought a different style would be great. So I got the Kelso in an 8. Way too small. So, ordered an 8.5 in Kelso and an 8 in HFS II thinking one of them was bound to work. Alas, I was wrong. The Kelso fit, but I found them very uncomfortable, almost as though there was a lump under my foot. Ahh, but I had a backup plan. HFS II in an 8, pulled them on, wanted to scream because they were too small. Compared them to my 8.5s, and they were the .5 in shorter that I expected. Why weren't they perfect?! After comparing and changing from shoe to shoe, realized the rubber toe cap was the issue. The 8.5, although too big, allowed my toe to hit before it started, in the 8, my toe was just into the rubber cap and it squished my toe, making the shoe feel too small. I might be able to get used to it, but I'm not willing to try. The 8s are going back.  Short version, style seems to drive the physical length of the shoe. A longer shoe (even in your usual size) might mean a more comfortable shoe. My HFS II look a little weird to me because the are too long, but they are really comfortable and the wide toe box has been great for my slightly misshapen foot.",

They’re very comfortable surprisingly. After my first day in them (I did run a mile in them) I had muscles that were sore that have never been sore before (mainly tibialis anterior/shin muscle) which I’m completely fin with because I’m hoping to strengthen my feet and also help my toes spread apart more with the wider toe box. Only complaint is that double knotting them is tough because the laces could be an inch or 2 longer.,

After a lot of off and on research for a barefoot-like gym shoe, I finally decided on these Xero HFS shoes. They are zero drop, thin sole, but not overly so which I prefer transitioning back into barefoot shoes and using at the gym. They have good traction on the floor, and work well between cardio machines, weight lifting, and fitness classes. They also work well with the width of my foot and I don't anticipate tearing at the little toe part of the shoe which has worn for me in the past.",

I got the right size. These shoes are as flexible, soft, and comfortable as I knew they would be, but omg, getting the size right was quite the journey. I have more Xero shoes than I can count from the past decade. But, for some reason, I had to get a half size smaller for these. Xero shoes wrote me and said that the rule of thumb is that 1/4 inch is half a size down and 1/2” is a whole size down. Not true. I first ordered from Amazon, which was double the price from Xero’s own site. I thought the long shoe must be a mistake, so I sent them back and got the same very long shoe half price from Xero, themselves. My normal size was way too long. Then of course, Xero sold out in their Black Friday sale, so of course no shoe to exchange. So, I went back to the overpriced (more than double) Amazon shoe and ordered a whole size down. Way too small, dear God. I patiently ordered again, and wallah, here I am this evening with the perfect half size down from my normal size. Thank you, Amazon for still having them, when Xero’s site does not. I paid double, but my spine will be very happy with how easily my feet and hips move in these. And, thank you Xero, that these shoes are not purple. Amazon and Xero show them as a god-awful black to purple. They are a classy black to grey that does not clash with my green pants, brown pants, red shirts, Christmas socks…..worth the long journey to happy feet.",2

Just the other day, I walked 7 miles/15,000 steps in the Kiziks I swore by for 2 years (because every other shoe gave me blisters), and they left my knees aching pretty badly. I thought that knee pain was inevitable, given my joint issues, but I didn't experience the same issue in the Xero shoes.  I got my HFS II Xero shoes in yesterday and immediately did a stress test on my treadmill. I made it 9 miles/20,000 steps, and the only thing that hurt was the bottom of my heels (which is normal for the distance I had walked on a hard surface). I also removed the insoles, so maybe this would be better with them in. To my surprise, these shoes also didn't give me blisters! I definitely recommend this shoe build.  Depending on the environment, your steps will be louder than in normal sneakers. Without much shock absorption, they sound like heels in the hallway. This is neither good nor bad, just different!  I gave four stars because the color was disappointing. I expected them to look more purple, like in the photos, but they look gray. I think most of the color options are ugly or manly. With an unconventional shoe shape, the brand should offset the shoes' inevitable oddness with prettier designs that appeal more to girls and women.",

I actually had to stop wearing those type of shoes and went back to cheap, flat sneakers like converse and vans. My feet felt much better. A nurse I work with highly recommended this brand so I thought I’d give it a try. I put these shoes on right out of the box and went to work my first 12 hour shift. They were comfortable as soon as I put them on. I walked over 17,000 steps in that 12 hours and my feet do not hurt at all!!! They were a bit tired, but definitely not sore. I figured I’d be paying for it when I woke up. My feet don’t ache or hurt at all! I am not a very active person outside of my job so I was a little worried.

I had been loyal to my Brooks and On Cloud shoes for years, so the idea of switching to something completely different felt daunting. My friend suggested I start by just wearing them around casually until my feet got used to the barefoot feel.  At first, they felt a bit strange, but after a few days, I started to notice how naturally my feet were moving. Now, they’re my go-to shoes whenever I lift weights. The ground connection and stability they offer are incredible. I’ve also taken them out for a few runs, and while I’m still adjusting, I can confidently say that anyone interested in transitioning to barefoot running should give these a try.

My first time wearing the Xeros to a theme park (Legoland NY, which is extremely hilly), I was a little anxious about them and worried about hurting my feet, but they were fine. Most recently, I went to Disneyland, and that is what made me decide I needed to review these. Disney is a lot of walking and a lot of standing. It was my first trip to a Disney resort for a multi day stay that I did not get blisters on my feet. I was definitely tired after about nine miles a day for three days, but I never got a blister. Invariably, every other shoe would eventually give me blisters after that much walking and standing for three consecutive days. For me, I think this is mainly due to finally having a wide enough toe box. I also recovered from muscle soreness MUCH faster than I anticipated after that much walking and loitering. I have more or less stopped wearing any other type of shoe, and I ordered the winter boots from the Xero website, which are functional and pretty cute, too. I’d recommend a subtle color if you have a larger foot, as the bright pink shoes felt like they’d look like clown shoes if they were much larger (I’m an 8.5). But they really look fine.

I would’ve given it five stars if the insole is softer that being said they are comfortable.UPDATE I have wanted another pair of these barefoot shoes and the HFS is discontinued. What I have been through to find a new pair is unbelievable. I bought the HFS2 in white size 7 because that’s the size I wore in HFS. I was so disappointed when they came. They were so big too long too wide and they look like clown shoes so then I tried the neo prio. They told me to buy my normal size of 6 1/2 so I did. They were too small so I ordered the size 7 and while they fit they were very uncomfortable so I contacted the company yet again about the HFS2 to explain what happened with them being big and they told me to order a 6 1/2. I did and they fit perfectly . But I will say that when I held the sole  up of the NFS and the NFS two the NFS two in 6 1/2 is a little bit larger than the nfs size 7I have solved the problem for now. I wish xero would make their sizing more consistent. But the NFS two is just as comfortable for me as the NFS. It was just a long road to get here.So if you like a barefoot shoe, which is the only thing I want to  wear when I wear closed  shoe, I highly recommend these but buyer beware about what size to order",3

I purchased these shoes for my wife (the shoes are designed specifically for women's feet), so the rest of the review below is written by her. Enjoy!  I really like using comfortable running shoes for everyday wear. Xero running shoes reminded me of Sketchers that I like a lot, so I have ordered 2 pairs of Xero shoes: ""HFS II"" and ""Forza Trainer"", both 7,5 UK/GB sizing, or 9 US size (which is my usual size). Well, unfortunately neither of them worked for me and surprisingly neither fit but each of them didn't fit in different ways.  I tried Forza Trainer 1st and could hardly squeeze my foot in! Yes, I do have wide feet, but I didn't expect that these running shoes, all flexible with soft foam inside, would have insufficient foot ark opening. More surprisingly, they appear to be one size bigger, and my big toe has a few centimeters of free space ahead. Toe box is also kind of huge even for my wide feet. But the ark area of the shoes was really tight and squeezing life out of my foot. So, they do feel extremely uncomfortable with a really tight ark area, totally flat foot bed, huge toe box, and very tight middle section. I can walk in them, but I do not enjoy it even a bit. So, it's a Nah from me...  Based on my first impression from the Xero Forza Trainer model, I expected that ""HFS II"" shoes would carry the same issues, but I was wrong. They had it even worse. First of all, these shoes were too small, I would say at least one size smaller than they are supposed to be. My toes pushed the toe box wall end very firmly. I would not risk walking in them as I'll lose my nails at some point if I keep using them due to constant rubbing. How can two models of shoes from the same company and the same size be so different? The ark area was a bit better though, so if I go one size up, I might be able to wear them more or less comfortably. And again, a completely flat foot bed does not provide any ark support during the wear.  *** TL;DR *** No, I cannot recommend these shoes by any means. They are not up to their list size. One pair was too roomy in the toe box area and too tight in the ark area. The other pair of exact same size was one size smaller so that I could not fit in my toes at all but wasn't too tight in the arc area. Jeez, how can you guess the right size if it's a random fit? Your experience might be different of course but mine is that I'm returning both pairs. One star for quality though, they seem to be well made. Therefore, 2 stars from me.  +++ Pros +++ 1) Nice packaging and presentation. 2) Seems like a quality made product.  --- Cons --- 1) Inconsistent sizing across models. 2) Too big and too small at the same time. 3) Some are too wide and roomy in the toe box area. 4) Some are too tight and narrow in the arc area. 5) Completely flat and thin foot bed. 6) Not comfortable at all, worst fit ever.",4

Xero is a brand new to me but I am amazed, excited, and impressed by these shoes immediately out of the box.  I ordered the women's HFS II Running Shoes, size 7, in the color 'Reflecting Pond'.  The construction of the Xero shoe is unlike any other shoe I have tried (it is a bit like the ""Earth Shoe"" which has a lowered heel, but Xero is even more comfortable in my opinion thus far).  Because I struggle with multiple myalgia and arthralgia due to autoimmune illnesses (like MCTD, sarcoidosis, Sjogren's) and mitochondrial dysfunction (which I mention in case this will help you!), I am very sensitive to discomfort and it is hard to align my joints in such a way as to minimize pain. As soon as I took off my normal sneakers and put on the Xero shoes, however, my spine and pelvis shifted naturally to a more upright position--this happened immediately and automatically with the shoes. Granted, I still need to be aware of my posture but I feel like my weight is better centered over my hips and center of gravity and thus puts less strain on my body, resulting in reduced lumbar and cervical/neck and shoulder pain. I tried these just as-is, as well as inserting my normal arch support orthotic insoles: the orthotics fit just fine, and make the experience of wearing the Xero shoes even better. *chef's kiss*  The Xero Drop Sole technology, along with their low-to-the-ground profile, make these shoes a distinctly different type of footwear. In a crowded field of athletic shoes, I'd say to try these if you're looking to improve performance through better alignment; I also recommend if you have lumbar spine and hip pain (it's just my opinion, I'm not a medical professional!).  As for the shoes overall, I'm having a great experience. They arrived in a nicely-packed box, and the box holds information about the shoe's design and features. I ordered my usual size 7, and the fit is outstanding: the length is perfect, and the toe box fits my wide feet beautifully. Xero states that their shoes have a barefoot feel, and I have to agree that's true.  It's cool that there are several color choices for this women's running shoe, and I'm super happy with the Reflecting Pond colors which are vivid and cheery, and also the color is well-placed because the front of the shoe is darker and a bit more subtle, transitioning into a bright green that gives a sassy kick of color as you move.

I have high arches and bunions so I was concerned that these would hurt my feet. I wear an 8.5 and 90% of the time I buy a size 9.  These shoes are minimalist materials but very comfortable. The size 9 is perfect.  I might have fit the 8.5 as well.  Don’t hesitate to buy these shoes.  They are very well made and comfy.,8

I finally wore out my old pair of Prios, and I thought I'd replace them with something that had a bit more tread (no grip on wet asphalt was my biggest gripe about the old Prios I had).  These new shoes felt pretty similar shape wise, but that's where the similarities ended. The fabric felt cheap and thin, the soles felt flimsy, the insoles wouldn't stay in (they weaseled their way out the back of my shoe every ¼ mile despite wearing a heel lock tie) — all in all, they had disappointingly poor construction to the point where I couldn't even complete my test run in them. I ended up returning the shoes and buying Altras instead for about half the price.  Really disappointed. I liked my Prios, and I like my sandals from Xero. Bummed that their sneaker construction seems to have taken a nose dive in quality while the prices have stayed at that premium level.",8

They are very comfortable, but for $120 they should be better quality. I am extremely disappointed. Although they tout many great qualities for their shoes, they still have a big fat ""MADE IN CHINA"" printed right on the sole of them. I will definitely go with a different brand next time. I have been burned by this company many times (I bought two pairs of their sandals when they first came out and I loved them for a few weeks. The strap broke on one pair and the sole was improperly made on the other. The company refused to replace them although they had a ""5,000-mile sole warranty"". This left a really bitter taste in my mouth, but I figured maybe they would have figured it out in the last 5 years). They drew me back in because of all the false advertising these social media influencers proclaim about the company. The reviews on Amazon weren't bad either, but this just made me realize how skewed the reviews are. I'm not sure that this company isn't some strange scam or pyramid scheme. I guess time will tell.  Very disappointed.",6

Order a half size up like suggested. These run smaller than the others. The “wide” next to some sizes is irrelevant as they’re all the same width. These are my umteenth pair of xero’s. Went with a women’s size 11.5 for the HFS and though I could’ve gone with an 11 these still fit near perfectly. I went a whole size up instead of the suggested half because I don’t like my toes touching the front at all, and based off of the information video + other reviews + my own experiences with xero shoes sizing a whole size up in these made sense. In other women’s shoes I’m generally size 10.5. Next time I’ll go with an 11 in the HFS because there’s a few centimeters extra I don’t necessarily need. So a half size up is a spot on suggestion. Hope this helps!",6

Their website also lists which models need to be ordered one size up, so the company is aware of the discrepancy but doesn’t correct it. Obviously that doesn’t stop me from getting them, love the wide toe box and zero drop heel. The sole is thin and sensitive but not as much as some barefoot shoes.

The only problem I had was the right shoe insert. It came wrinkled which caused it to slide down while walking. I had a hard time contacting the seller through Amazon so I went directly to their site and asked for a new insert. They happily obliged and the replacement is in the mail now.

I bought them to replace the Merrel Vapor line as Merrel continued to discontinue and/or change the models and their features. The Xero shoe is 0mm drop and is a true barefoot flat shoe. There is no arch support (which I like). The toe box is nice and wide so your toes can freely and easily wiggle. I do have problems with the laces string tied though. Overall its a great shoe that I will continue to buy and wear.,
