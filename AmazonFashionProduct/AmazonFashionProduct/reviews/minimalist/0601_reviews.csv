I like them so much that I'm considering buying a couple extra pairs just in case they get discontinued.  Fit: It's super hard for me to find shoes that fit. I am a size 8 with triple wide feet. However, my width is only in the toebox-- my feet and ankles are of normal thickness. Most super wide shoes don't fit me because they make parts of the shoes besides just the toe box wide, eg, the top part and ankle. However, these shoes fit amazingly! The only perfect fit out of the box I've ever had without getting custom shoes. The toe box is actually wide enough!!! (I ordered 8 Wide.)  Comfort: The shoes are very basic. Just canvas and rubber soles, no support. That's the point of zero drop shoes! I find them very comfortable, but if you want arch support and padding, this isn't the shoe for you.  Durability: They are surpisingly durable! First pair was still doing well after nearly a year, replaced it bc I got them too dirty to clean. I first ordered a pair in Nov 2023. I wore that pair most days a week for nearly a year, putting at least 500 miles on the shoes. Even after that, they were still in good condition. Super impressed by their durability given that it's a relatively cheap ($30-45) product on Amazon. I ultimately replaced them not because they were falling apart, but because I got them so dirty while walking in mud that I couldn't adequately clean them.  Style: I love that these shoes are plain white canvas without any obstrusive patterns or logos. The white version would be perfect if you wanted to paint or embroider a custom design on a pair of shoes. They look classy and go with any outfit. Because they're versatile and lightweight, they're great for traveling.",14
