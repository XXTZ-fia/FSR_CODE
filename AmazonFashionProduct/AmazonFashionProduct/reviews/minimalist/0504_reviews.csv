However, he finds them comfortable. For reference, my 5 yrs old son wears size 12 in Nike sneakers. The material is soft, with nice faux elastic laces, the foam insole provides good cushioning, and they are also removable, so you can replace them with comfortable ones. The only downside are the velcro straps, which seem a bit flimsy. Despite being hemmed along the trim, the edges are already showing signs of wear after just a few hours of wearing them out and about. Overall, these are comfortable, and the quality is good, but the straps could be improved.",

My son says they are comfortable, and for a kid that doesn't like wearing shoes, that's a win.  There are two detractors, however. 1. The shoes are loose on his heel. If we cinch the velcro really tight, he's content with them, but it's something to be aware of. 2. These are not super high quality shoes. I got them to be ""church"" shoes so the shoes should last us well enough.
