"""Waystation 49""",Fun ring! Looks great on.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5MJ0W6TZMAMD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CC7N8D8Q,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 7, 2023",Color: Silver,Verified Purchase,"This is fun, unique, and I think it looks good with both casual and dressier other jewelry.  For me, it is a ring I look forward to wearing often.  TIP: Always remove BEFORE washing hand, or working on something where ring might catch (cooking to working on art projects, of a car). Twice I almost lost this down the sink! Soap makes ring loose. An open back ring doesn’t stick on a finger the way a better ring, that is closed, does.",
