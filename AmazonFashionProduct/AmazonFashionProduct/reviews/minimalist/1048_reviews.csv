They're extremely comfortable, flexible, and you can feel every bit/detail of what you're walking over. I'm a musician and standing for a 2-4 hour performance in my normal footware has started to cause me pain and fatigue. These shoes have solved that issue.  I only detract one star for the material within the heel of the shoe. It seems to be of a very thin and brittle material, and it has turned into a weird ""crumpled ball of paper"" inside of the heel's fabric type of feeling. I don't know how else to explain that. They would be perfect for how they're advertised/described if this could be fixed. I will buy these again if needed so it is really a non-issue, I'm just being picky.

So I may post updates if things change.  What I like:  I like that the toebox is shaped like an actual human foot. I like having space to splay and wiggle my toes and these shoes offer that. I like how minimal they are. They feel like I'm wearing nothing.  What I don't like:  I knew what I was signing up for when I bought these, but I don't like the ""zero drop"" aspect of these shoes. Interestingly enough, the insoles in these shoes seem to be more of a ""negative drop"" than ""zero drop."" The thickness of the insole at the heel feels thinner than at the toes when I take it out and give it the ""very precise and scientific"" finger pinch test. After a day of wearing them with the stock insoles I went to Walmart and bought some Dr. Scholl's cut-to-fit gel insoles that provide a tiny bit of heel raise to them. That modification made these shoes quite a bit more comfortable if you're not a fan of the zero drop aspect. It also gave the general experience of walking around a bit more cushion. I know...I'm defeating the purpose of ""barefoot"" style shoes by adding heel lift and cushion. Check the pictures to see which Dr. Scholl's insole I got.  My only other ""complaint"" about these shoes is that the soles are kind of loud and tappy sounding when my toes land on the ground. Hopefully that goes away over time.",2
