You'd think they would from their look and the fabric, but my feat would be sweaty and wet anytime i wore these longer than an hour or two. My feet would smell awful and so would the shoe. I would take them off and leave wet spots on the floor as i walked. Didnt mater what socks id wear whool, cotton, didnt matter. And when i didnt wear socks it was actually worse. These are not barefoot shoes. The back of the shoe gave me a blister everytime id try, and again my feet would be wet and smelly.  They also got extremely dirty very quickly i would wash them with bleach regularly..... i tossed them after spending an 8 hour day in them, my wife and i went on a day trip and i could smell my feet walking in the stores. I bought new shoes and threw them out. Dont waste your money.",

I’m very impressed especially for the price point. These are my favorite lifting shoes because I can feel the ground and there is no lift in the heel. They are not padded so walking or running in them is not the best but I do jump rope in them. I like how the sole wraps up the edges a bit and even has rubber where laces tie. I find this handy when doing band or cable work so that things don’t slip off. I also really like the style and look of them. Black is super functional but now I want to add other colors! I’m more of a true 9 so sometimes there’s a bit more looseness than I’d like but I wear thin socks too. I could cinch them down more with the laces though.  My favorite part is that I can leave them tied and slip them on and off. They also don’t take up much space in my workout bag.",

Using their size guide we actually got shoes that fit the first time around! If you’ve ever bought shoes online before, especially for kids AND considering European sizes, that’s a small miracle.  We mostly wear them barefoot (without socks), I had a small period of adjusting my outside toe to that as expected (photographed) but now I can with ease, and if I choose a low sock the fit/wear is just as pleasant, no sliding down on the back of heel, there’s actually small cushions on the inside of the shoe I tried to picture. They’re so comfortable. I never tie or untie these, I slide on and off each wear, the sock fit is a very nice feature for me here. I included photos comparing to crocs, vivos, and hey dudes but those all have pretty wide toe boxes.  My girls, ages 5&2 loved them from the get—sparkly and beautiful, and not in a ‘in your face pink glitter for a girl’ color, they can go with or without socks (never experiencing a blister) AND they can take them on and off without help. Which holds a lot of weight for most moms.  Speaking of weight, they’re very light. They don’t feel blocky or sound like my kids are having a hard time wearing them, even with the wider toe box which is my favorite part and is likely why the fit is so comfortable for all of us. Most US made adult tennis shoes have tight toe boxes where these do not, without compromising look/style. I love the tannish beige, I accepted they wouldn’t stay ‘clean’ forever but I don’t regret my choice. They match with everything and I can wear them with every kind of bottom except skinny jeans as I just personally don’t like the look of tight jeans with a tennis shoe but I’ll wear leggings, sweats, joggers and shorts with them.  Lastly, Kids’ tend to show the quality of a shoe/brand pretty quickly. These have held up well as being our main shoe since summer 2024—parks, outside play, coaching volleyball and still nice enough for church. Current (Dec 2024) photos showing wear included.",16

This is super disappointing because these shoes were very comfortable, even as my first pair of ""barefoot"" shoes and I felt I was walking better, more upright. Its also quite disappointing that if you go to the company's website, there is no way to contact them. I will be checking for that before making future online purchases and I will not be making additional purchases or recommending WHITIN. I had originally planned to try them myself and then purchase for my husband and son if they worked out. Its only because I'm not a huge online shopper that kept me from getting online and already making additional purchases since they were so comfortable, so this company will lose out. It looks like enough people like them, or submitted a review before the shoes broke/tore, that they probably won't miss my contribution to their profits though.  The pictures are of the same tear, one zoomed out so you can see where on the shoe it is, the other zoomed in.

I have always had horrible feet, my second toe is longer then my first. All my toes curve towards the pinky toe which makes me have large bunions under my big toe. About 15 years ago I developed a fungus under my toe nails that I have been dealing with. I got to talking to a nurse and it was brought to my attention that if ur body is fighting an infection eventually it gets worn down which can cause a lot of other problems eventually lead to heart disease and death because it fights continually to fight infection. I have no health insurance so I've been cutting my toe nails very, very short and putting bleach directly on them, it has always been painful for me to walk but, excruciating getting older, my feet have gotten wider and wrking on concrete floors all my life then trying to get rid of this nail fungus.

Jill K.,Nice fit and looks good,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUQIQQ87EW71N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08LPXY2R4,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 22, 2024",Size: 9-9.5Color: W63 | Black/Gum,Verified Purchase,"I like this shoe a lot. Roomy toe box. Zero drop. Light weight. Easy laces. Just enough stretch. All of that and it looks good too. It’s my new favorite. I just did five miles and while I could definitely feel the trail, I didn’t have any pain through the soles. I’m glad I found these",
BMitchell,"Nice, but not for me",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28XM2OV4D36R5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08LPXY2R4,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 22, 2024",Size: 5.5-6Color: W30 | Pink/Grey,Verified Purchase,"Giving these a 3 star. The toe box is definitely wide enough for my wide feet, the 5.5-6 is a perfect length, and the feeling is almost like being barefoot. However, the top of my feet hurt because of not enough room top to bottom, and I loosened everything as much as I could, straps and Velcro both. Very disappointed. I am sure they will work out great for most folks, but not for me.",16
Slow and Chonky,I’ve been surprised and humbled.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22E7FD9BOR0VJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08LPXY2R4,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 22, 2024",Size: 7.5-8Color: W63 | Jet Black,Verified Purchase,"Brand new vs nearly 1600 miles in a year. I’m pretty impressed with my first pair of barefoot shoes since I rarely get a year out of a single pair of shoes. Knowing that I wore them and walked/ran/mowed a distance equal to twice the width of Texas plus 49.27 miles or twice the length of Texas minus 6.73 miles puts it into perspective. They held up phenomenally well. I originally ordered them with the intention of upgrading to a higher quality barefoot shoe (like Xero) when/if they fell apart a month later. They were supposed to be my test shoe to see if barefoot shoes improved my foot pain. Here I am, a year later, replacing them with the exact same shoes. I’ve been humbled and feel the need to lay them to rest respectfully rather than unceremoniously tossing them in the bin. Here’s to the next 1600 miles, or maybe 2000 (I’m feeling adventurous).",19
