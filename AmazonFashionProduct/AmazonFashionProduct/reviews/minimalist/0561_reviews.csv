They should be wider for people like me who take Wide. The length of the shoe is fine. The laces are great for adjusting width and comfort. These also have reflective stripes, and look cool for fashion. I will be wearing them with my orthodics on top of their insert (soles). Important to note they already have a small crack on the sole. But they did improve my posture while walking, on literally the first day, and my core muscles actually relaxed (stomache area) followed by my shoulders dropping down, instead of being tensed up. I also put thin Orthodics from my Dr, right over the foot bed, and they fit fine. If you have wide feet these are not for you, but probably excellent for normal width feet.",6

Ended up one full size larger to get the appropriate length, but the shoe was sooo wide around the foot.

I consistently wear a women's 9.5, and these were too short, and flared up my toenail that has a tendency toward ingrowing. Additionally, the two box was much narrower than I expected. It's possible that a size 10 would have fit length-wise, but they still would have been narrow in the toe box. If I buy from this brand in the future, I will have to try men's. Which doesn't seem fair; seems to me that both men's and women's should be equally roomy in the toe box. Women need wide toe box shoes too.",

I have wide feet and I was happy to see they had a wide option. These have a flexible sole and I love that the sides cinch tighter as they are intertwined with the laces to provide better support. I was using running shoes for my weight training sessions and my regulat running shoes were just unstable. These fit snugly once tightened around the ankle and they do not compress my toes. I feel very stable in these shoes. I know I will have a better footing in these and I can use them for deadliest and squats without distorting my form. I already want to buy another pair for walking. I noticed I was standing upright better; unlike running shoes that cause me to lean forward. Definitely recommend them to anyone considering a minimal shoes.
