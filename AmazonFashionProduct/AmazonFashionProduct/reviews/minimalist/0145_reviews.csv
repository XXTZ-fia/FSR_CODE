I feel in love. I don't foresee buying a different brand of shoe ever again. I've been wearing them daily for about a month, detailing boats, working out, everyday life, walking around the city, etc. Once your feet get used to the barefoot feeling (my feet were pretty sore for the first couple of days, it felt like I was walking around everywhere barefoot, go figure) your balance is better, your ankles are more stable, your feet don't feel crammed at the end of the day. For me, it's the perfect shoe. Not to mention I can climb up a 45 degree painted surface like in the video and they have grip like a geckos foot.",

I tried one of their canvas shoes and the fit was not high enough, but these mesh ones are great for wide (mine are wide) and thick (with high arches that won't fit in a lot of shoes).

The traction is so good that they don't slip on a vinyl or laminate floor like many other shoes do.I recommend buying 1/2 size larger than usual.  Here's why:  I bought a size 8 and found that it lacks the toe wiggle room of ""WHITIN Women's Canvas/Leather Barefoot Shoes | Wide Width Minimalist Sneakers | Classic Fit Low Top"" in size 9.5.  According to the size charts, the measurements are supposed to be identical, but they pressed down on the top of my toes until I removed the insole.  The women's 9.5 is almost an inch longer than my feet and the men's 8 gives me less than 1/2 inch.  The result is my toes bump the end of the shoe when going down hill.

What I mean by that is if I step on my phone charger cord I can feel it. Feels like I'm wearing 2-3 pairs of thick socks.  They might feel small when you first put them on. When I put them on I thought my big toes were pushed up against the front end. In reality, I have about 1/4 inch between my big toes and the end of the shoe but the canvas is low so I can feel it touching the tip of my toenails. I'm sure overtime that will work itself out. One of the attached pictures shows where the end of my toe is compared to the end of the shoe.

For me personally I should kick myself in the ass for not doing it sooner. These shoes are great for walking on almost all surfaces but, it takes some getting used to if all you do is walk on concrete. I spend enough time on concrete for work so on my off time I like to spend more time on a little more natural floor like grass or dirt gravel sand etc. I've worn these on a few easier hikes and my feet never really started hurting at any point. Will definitely be expanding by getting a few more pairs that whittin offer",

I also have a very narrow foot as is so maybe normal shoes are better for me.  I’ve been having this type of shoe marketed towards me for weeks before I decided to try it out, with people talking about how much it helped their posture, back pain, and overall health. As someone who’s had chronic back pain most of my life, I figured I’d give it a shot. Wearing these while standing for just a few hours makes my entire body hurt. If my back pain is normally like a 3, this probably brought it up to a 7. Not to mention, the thin soles let you feel EVERYTHING, and not in a fun, “feel the grass between your feet” kind of way but in a “sensory nightmare, you feel the texture of the pavement below your feet even though you’re wearing socks.” For me this was a great learning moment teaching me I definitely need a supportive shoe and can’t sacrifice that, but I’d say that’s about the only positive thing I have to say about this.",
