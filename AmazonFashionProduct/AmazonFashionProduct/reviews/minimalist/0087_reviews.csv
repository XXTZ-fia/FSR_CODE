The only issue is that the cards don't stagger that well, so it will be difficult to grab the one without taking them all out.  The outer slots are tight and will grab onto cards like a clamp. The flap is magnetic and easy to open.  A downside is that the wallet is on the thick side for what it carries.  Note: The money clip can be removed if it's not wanted.",

I love the flap for your ID so you can quickly show that when needed without having to take it out the wallet. The metal clip is great as well in case you have any paper bills or receipts to carry or it can be used to secure the whole wallet into a pocket or backpack, etc. The opening they made is perfect for your thumb to press and slide out another one of the your most used cards.

For you, it may be.  I definitely enjoyed carrying it and plopping it out when I needed to pay for things, just was looking for something a bit more streamlined (currently I'm rocking a pretty demure slimline that has an outer moneyclip and expands for all the cards I need; it's treating me pretty well).Though I may never see this wallet again, I do find it quite deserving of a 5 out of 5 recommendation.

The core card holder is strong, I have cracked numerous credit cards over the years. They crack too easy because of embossing, thankfully most cards are moving to flat design since mechanical credit slip registers are a thing of the past. But even several flat cards have not made it till expiration in my old wallet before cracking, but now they are protected by a hard aluminum alloy case. Currently I have 4 flat cards and 2 embossed loaded and they lift and fan perfectly at the push of a button. The ID flap folds over and secures fairly well magnetically, covering the popup card slot so the cards are always securely retained in your pocket. The ID window is nice, but it is quite tight with my medical directive tucked beneath, just a little more space would be appreciated. The same is true of the 2 pockets on the outside of the flap, the under slot fits a flat credit card well, but the outer slot is very tight, my thin insurance card does well. The slot under the money clip fits a flat credit card well. The money clip fits 10 bills easily and holds about 20 bills max. It would be nice if another flap could fold over the bills to protect them in your pocket, the flap could also have a slot/pouch to stick temporary receipts, etc. This wallet is smaller than my older traditional wallets and provides much better protection to the contents, the thickness is just under 1"". My old wallet was right at 1¼"", so I think the flap over the money clip and pouch slot is feasible if well designed. The wallet is perfect for my front jeans pocket for best security and does well in the rear pocket as well. Overall this is the best wallet I have found and I think it will last for as long as any other wallet I have ever owned. I love the popup card feature, it works so smoothly and perfectly every time, I can fairly easy pick any card out of the fanned stack and have no trouble getting it back in the same position. A finger push on top of the stack easily sets them right back in their place and the flap secures the cards so they cannot eject of fall out in your pocket as several other similar wallets are noted for doing. I give this wallet a solid 5 star rating as it is and will watch for the Semorid brand to introduce future improvements and model variations that may fit my needs even better.",

The ID window is hidden but easily displayed. The exterior card pockets are on both sides and should be very handy. Same for the (one) money clip – well placed, useful. We are to assume it has total RFID blocking. Talking points from recipient: It is heavy and hard – especially if going directly (and, comparing to) a genuine leather tri-fold (regular) type of wallet. Having said that, definitely will be useful but will not be an every day, go-to wallet. I think my overall rating is a bit generous. Had I been given the option this one is more like a 4.25 or 4.5. But in all fairness rated an overall 5 because it is very, very close to “as described”.",

Having the money clip and ID window are important to me so keeping those while having a thinner interior would be a big plus. Still, it is a great option and especially if you still want to be able to carry several cards while not keeping a fat wallet. There's a little instruction card in one of the pockets that shows how many cards can fit in each slot, and it comes in a holder box that is perfect for gifting as well. The coolest feature is definitely the pop-up card holder of the main compartment (the one I wish would be available in smaller sizes). It works exactly as advertised, popping your cards out in a discernible ascending order when you hit the switch.",

The nicest feature to me, of this type is the flip-open see-through cover of the ID sleeve. I have not been able to find this feature on other wallets of similar design. This eliminates removal when required to show my DL. The other side of that flap holds 2 cards and has a thumb-push slot. The carbon fiber design of the leather completes the whole package for me. Then there is the small lever on the side that pushes up the credit cards which works as it should ejecting all cards at slightly different heights. Turn the wallet over to make use of the clip that securely holds folded paper money. There you'll also find another card slot with a thumb-push slot. Highly recommend this wallet.",

Cards fan reliably, mechanism is smooth. 6 cards is the sweet spot, fewer than 5 and the fan just isn't as smooth and they aren't as snug. Up to 7 cards (3 with raised numbers) works great. 8 would work if they aren't raised. The card slot under the cash clip is a really tight fit but fine for something you rarely need access to.

It was also just a little bit larger in dimension than a credit card and only 3/16 of an inch thick.  It was truly minimalist!  As opposed to this wallet that weighs 4.1 ounces empty and is 5/8 of an inch thick at the money clip.  Exactly twice as thick as my old minimalist wallet.  On the positive side I was able to fit everything from my old wallet (which was full) into this new one and still have room for more.Despite not really being minimalist, this wallet has really grown on me.  I love the credit card pop up feature and my drivers license and CCW are able to be removed easily.I hope to get many years of service from this Semorid wallet.

The money clip might be the biggest downside to this wallet, it's rather pointy in your pocket when you have three or more bills in it, so best to have the money side pointed to the outside when it goes into your pocket.

I like the overall look of this wallet and wanted to make sure my wallet would have RFID blocking.",

"Scott Rooks Headland, Alabama",NICEST SLIM WALLET I HAVE EVER OWNED,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R51A6I2VD5H38/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCLFT2SD,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 25, 2024",Color: Carbon Fiber Black,,"The men in my generation always carried wallets (otherwise called billfolds) in their rear pocket. My chiropractor said it created a lot of good business for him. This younger generation eschewed the old school wallet in favor of these nifty slim wallets that could easily slip into the front pocket (majorly discouraging pickpockets). Since I surrendered the old leather wallet and joined the cool crowd, I have loved this style, but have also worn out a few. The feature I like most about this wallet over my others is the lever that pops up my credit cards. I will eventually wear this one out too, but I will be looking for the same feature in future wallets!",
Dana E. Cameron,"Useful Minimalist Design, Carbon Fiber Styling is OK",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ALXEEXG4EVMN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCLFT2SD,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 24, 2024",Color: Carbon Fiber Black,,"This slim wallet design from Semorid is a major departure from the bifold and trifold leather wallets I’ve used over the years. All of them had plenty of slots to hold cards. But the also featured a big pocket for paper bills and receipts, and that’s where I got into trouble. I stopped carrying cash years ago, but receipts constantly found their way into my wallet. Gift and loyalty cards too. Pretty soon, I could barely close the thing.  The design of this wallet doesn’t allow for such bloat. It features an RFID-shielded metal chassis that’s not much bigger than your standard cards. The left side of the chassis features an integrated “hangling” hole (a built-in metal loop) to which you could attach a carabiner. There’s a central chamber that holds the cards, and a right-side enhanced slide trigger to actuate the cards up in a spread so you can easily get to the card you want. Pushing the cards back in is effortless.  It comfortably accommodates up to 6 cards. Any more than that will strain, or even jam, the mechanism and make it difficult to get the cards in and out. The actuator grips the cards just enough to trigger them up, and they won’t fall out on their own if the wallet is held upside down. But it isn’t strong enough to prevent the cards from falling out of the chamber if you hold it upside down and shake. Do that, and your cards will fall out with less exertion than you’d expect.  So smartly, the wallet also features a card flap that folds over the top, preventing your cards from falling out. The flap has two card pockets on the outside and a clear window pocket on the inside for your picture ID. There are finger holes at the bottom of the outside pockets, and a finger hole in the center of the clear ID window inside, for easy card extraction. The flap magnetically attaches to the bottom of the wallet’s front side. The magnet isn’t particularly strong, but is enough to prevent the flap from flopping open on its own. Again, a good shake will open it with cards loaded on both sides. A similar pocket with finger hole is on the back side of the wallet, under a premium money clip.  The carbon fiber styling isn’t as matte as I was expecting, but it isn’t bad. The pockets and notches on one side are angled, seemingly to match with the diagonal pattern of the carbon fiber styling. The effect isn’t seamless, and seems a little forced, being that the angles of the pockets don’t match the angle of the carbon fiber. I think the pockets would complement the carbon fiber styling better if they went straight across, but that’s just me. This is otherwise an impressive, minimalist and useful offering from Semorid.

But it's not really slim. First off, heavier than most leather wallets out of the box (weight alone is not too bad, I'm one of those people that panicks about forgetting my wallet even though it's in my pocket... So more awareness of it can be nice).  I ordered this to replace my previous ""slim"" wallet which is pictured completely full next to this one completely empty and they are the same width. Besides the 7 cards in the inside pop-up, everything else adds even more thickness. As a result it is almost uncomfortable in a front hand pocket and unwearable in the back. There is nothing going on under the flap except for one ID card pocket. A whole flap seems extra. Maybe if the money clip was some kind of rod or band that stayed under the flap and was enclosed by it, instead of being in the outside, it would save on some if the bulk. I'm going to keep using it but can see myself replacing it within a year (the previous one lasted me over 5 and was just anothr cheap $10 Amazon item).  I do really like the pop out technology and that alone saves space... But you'd want a place to put cash and an ID that is separate, as well as most popular card, and there's gotta be a slimmer way to do it.",

But it holds fewer cards than this one, and I preferred a wallet that can fit more cards.  I’m unsure whether I’ll end up using this one though. While it does hold more cards, there are downsides to this as well.  For starters, since it does have a larger capacity, it is somewhat larger than the classic minimalist wallet. That said, it’s still more smaller/slimmer than the standard wallet.  Also, I found it difficult to remove cards from the outer flap, since the flap moves whenever I try pulling the cards. As you can see in my uploaded video.  Then again, it does fit quite a bit. I can fit 9 cards in the main slot (or more, depending on card type), and more + cash in the other slots.  So I’m still debating about this. Overall I still feel that it’s an important from the standard wallet.",2

This minimalist wallet from the Semorid brand seemed better than other similar products that I have seen being that it is foldable with designated areas for ID's and additional cards throughout its surface.  The RFID protecting aluminum box can hold up to 12 credit cards, but I thankfully do not have nearly that many and I now keep them inside where they are protected.  The cards stay inside with literally no chance or danger of them falling out of the device, and there is a convenient lever on the side that easily and safely dispenses them when they are required for use.As previously mentioned, other pockets for cards are available besides what can fit inside the product's aluminum box attachment.  Personally, I use those for my medical insurance card and other cards that do not contain electronic chips that can be accessed by scammers.  Those cards will remain safely inside the RFID protected aluminum box.  The foldable window-ID pocket is ultra convenient for my driver's license as well.  It is designed so that it is easily removable when it is required to be presented quickly.Overall, this device is a bit larger and bulkier than I originally anticipated, but not so much that it is uncomfortable or cumbersome to fit inside my pants pocket.  At first glance I thought that it would be slightly lighter in weight, but this is just a testament to the product's careful craftsmanship and obvious potential long-term durability.  Compared to my previous leather wallet, this device has made my life a lot easier, more efficient, and much more convenient.The current asking price is a bit steep despite the features and convenience that it promotes, but I often see coupons and deals attached this product that you can take advantage of and save a lot of money if you act quickly while they are still available.  For me, this wallet is definitely worth its price since it continues to save me time, space, and aggravation, not to mention the added security of its RFID blocking technology.",

This SEMORID wallet fit the bill and then some.  I hardly carry cash these days so having a wallet focused on cards was excellent. The mechanism to get the cards out is nifty and sturdy. I do like that it's the size of a standard wallet but way more slim as it fits in my front pocket perfectly.  The outside slots for card on the front and the one in the back is handy as is the money clip when I do have cash on me.  I would highly recommend these to anyone looking to make the switch from a standard wallet to a minimalist version.,
