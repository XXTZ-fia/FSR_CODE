I wouldn't say it's classic barefoot, I think it's transitional to barefoot (one review said that it feels like a home slippers - yes, it's kind of soft). For me it's ok, I'm ok with classic barefoot shoes, I can walk whole day on any surface. Main thing for me was to introduce the barefoot shoes to my son. He plays competitive soccer, I know that he has wide foot like me, and I feel bad when I see him wearing his soccer cleats - they are so narrow, it's absolutely impossible to find inexpensive wide cleats. So we decided that he was going to change his cleats to these shoes every time after a game or practice. So far, we like it. We walked around, we hiked, we even played soccer (practiced) in these shoes. They are surviving. I say ""solid 4 stars"" because I still have no idea how long they will survive. As I see it's a relatively new product, it just appeared - we do not know how long it will last. For us it serves its purpose well.",

My foot is forced to walk as if I'm barefoot, and it does wonders for how my feet feel. I wear these every chance I get, as they feel much better than $100+ shoes that I own and much much better than the steel toed shoes I am made to wear at work. These shoes give my feet relief.

The other drawback is that the tongue on one side falls over to the side while walking, which is a common problem for me no matter the shoe as I have narrow feet. The little loop on the tongue that is supposed to prevent this never seems to work.

They come very cheaply flattened and wrapped in plastic, and upon freeing them from their trappings, they are misshapen and look like garbage. But then I put them on and they magically take the shape of the most normal looking barefoot shoes I have tried. They have a very natural feeling footbed and good grip. If I had a gripe, it is that for some reason I have yet to figure out, I find the front of my feet feeling and sounding like they are kind of slapping down on the ground with each step, though this has been somewhat universal with barefoot shoes.

I’ve been looking for a pair of minimalist shoes that provide comfort, support, and a wide toe box, and these have exceeded all of my expectations. Whether I’m trail running, walking, or working out in the gym, these shoes deliver exceptional performance and comfort.  Wide Toe Box for Maximum Comfort The wide toe box is a standout feature. It allows my toes to spread naturally, which is crucial for maintaining balance and preventing discomfort during long runs or walks. The extra space gives my feet a natural feel, unlike traditional running shoes that tend to squeeze my toes together.  Zero Drop Design The zero drop design is perfect for those who prefer a minimalist shoe. It promotes a natural stride and keeps me grounded while running or walking. I can really feel the connection to the ground, and it’s helped improve my posture and balance during various activities.  Non-Slip and Durable The non-slip sole is fantastic, providing excellent traction on different surfaces, from rugged trails to gym floors. I feel secure running on wet or uneven terrain without any slipping. The shoes are also very durable—I’ve used them for everything from running to wrestling, and they’ve held up well.  Lightweight and Breathable These shoes are incredibly lightweight, making them ideal for long runs or extended periods of wear. The breathable material keeps my feet cool, even during intense workouts, and the minimalist design gives a barely-there feeling, which I love.  Versatile and Stylish Aside from being functional, they look great! The clean white design makes them versatile enough to wear casually, not just for workouts. I get compliments on them all the time, whether I’m wearing them to the gym or out for a casual walk.  Conclusion Overall, these barefoot shoes with a wide toe box are a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a minimalist, zero-drop shoe. They offer exceptional comfort, durability, and performance for a variety of activities, from trail running to gym workouts. I highly recommend them for anyone looking for a versatile, high-quality pair of shoes!",
Scott,Shoes came crushed in shrink bag and one is cut narrower than the other,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5YKUP2DRUEBN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DH4N1DG1,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 9, 2024",Color: Grey/LightSize: 11 Wide,,These shoes came crushed in one of those vacuum bags so they were practically flat. The back heel area was all smashed and bent.  After putting them on you can clearly see that the left toe area is wider than the right which is more narrow. You can feel the difference so these are not wearable.  I give it 2 stars because the one that was made correctly was actually comfortable and the bottom soles had great traction but they are cheaply made and terrible packaging so I doubt these would last long at all.,2
D_Doll,Husband approved!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36E4U6KVDG8OD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DH4N1DG1,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 8, 2024",Color: Full BlackSize: 9 Wide,,"My husband has the widest feet of anyone I've ever known. They're like bear feet, super wide at the toe and across the front portion of his foot. He tends to walk very flat footed, despite having a good arch to his feet, and so I was curious to see how these shoes would suit him. He put them on this morning and has not taken them off yet - he actually is favoring these over his house slippers currently. He said they are immediately comfortable and the first pair of shoes where his toes don't feel at all compressed together. They're very breathable, and his feet don't feel hot or sweaty. They were easy to slip on, and there's no areas or seams that are rubbing uncomfortably in any way. He's worn them to the store, he did a tiny bit of yard work outside, and he's STILL wearing them. They have good traction on slick surfaces, and we'll absolutely be taking these out with us sailing as these feel like he'll be more sure footed on deck without having his feet compressed. They do mimic more closely the feel of walking around barefoot. If you, or someone you love, needs that extra wide toe box, these are absolutely the shoes for you!",
Susan P.,Great fitting shoes for my wide feet!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39PV9UOWP4PT3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DH4N1DG1,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 8, 2024",Color: Black/GumSize: 13 Wide,,"Super excited when I saw these shoes in a size 13 wide, which is very hard to find. They have a nice wide toe box, which is perfect for my feet, and a zero arch drop. The interior memory foam soles are very comfortable and have a good amount of spring to them. They are removable in case you want to put in your own custom orthotics. Has a contrasting orange sole, which is a fun, trendy look. These are very lightweight, with sturdy laces and a breathable canvas exterior. Great to wear while traveling, to the gym, or on long walks. Very excited about breaking these in!",
Eddie,Very comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MNG9J5JKAQSH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DH4N1DG1,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 8, 2024",Color: Grey/DarkSize: 11 Wide,,"I was skeptical that these would be comfortable, but gladly I was wrong! These are very comfortable, and help me with some of my back pain due to better standing and walking posture. The only thing that drives me crazy is the laces. If these had some sort of quick strap they would be even better! Overall, they are my new go to shoes to wear for health reasons",

I've been using Nike free run for quite some time and wanted to transition over to barefoot shoes but price has always been one of the main factors preventing me from trying.  I picked brown color which, I kind of regret because it doesn't look all that great, but who cares? I can feel the ground a lot better and it feels good not having an elevated heel drop.",
