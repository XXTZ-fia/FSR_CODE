Hier aber nicht, das sah trotzdem gut aus. An den Schultern für mich angemessen, bin weder schmal noch breit. Auch die Länge (sonst immer ein Problem für mich) war angenehm, nicht zu kurz für den Outdooreinsatz aber auch nicht zu lang um komisch auszusehen. Die Kapuze hatte auch eine kleine Verstärkung vorne, hat mir gut gefallen. Deshalb schreibe ich auch diese Rezension, weil viele Outdoorprodukte natürlich für den Outdooreinsatz geschnitten sind. Aber viele Leute tragen ihre Outdoorkleidung im Urlaub und im Alltag (warum auch nicht, wenn man so viel Geld ausgibt?). Jedenfalls ist es deshalb aber erfreulich, wenn diese Kleidung einen guten Schnitt hat. Das ist Marmot hier gelungen. Ich habe die Jacke aber zurückgeschickt, da ich für den Einsatz in den Bergen nicht so ein großer Fan des Paclite-Materials war. Von Gore-Tex ist Paclite auch nicht für Trekking empfohlen. Diese Jacke ist daher etwas für den Wanderer im Wald ohne schweres Gepäck. Ich habe stattdessen eine Jacke mit einer Außenschicht aus Polyamid (Goretex Performance Shell) gewählt.",

This differentiates it from the 3 layer 'Pro' jackets at much higher cost. It also means that you can pack it down really flat and it is really light.  What this means is that you are free to choose your own insulation and mid-layers to your own comfort and activity levels and probably means that it is a more flexible solution overall.  Like all Gore-tex jackets, it is super water resistent when new and will likely wane with time as the factory coating wears down before it needs to be re-proofed again. I cannot fault it and it is indeed windproof enough to cut the wind-chill of heavy mountain weather and arctic storms. Helpfully, it has pit-zips under the arms to help you regulate your temperature when the much-toucted Gore-Tex 'breathability' inevitably is insufficient.

Ich bin 178cm groß, 84gk schwer und habe einen kleinen Wohlstandsbauch - Größe L hat aber ok gepasst, etwas zu weit, aber M war zu Körpernah für eine Fleeceschicht darunter.  Das Material fühlt sich sehr wertig an und hat einen leicht rauen Touch, also nicht Plastik-mäßig sondern erinnert an natürliches Material, gefällt mir sehr gut. Ist auch nicht so dünn, wie viele Regenjacken heutzutage.  Nun zu dem enttäuschenden Punkt:  KAPUZE Und jetzt zur größten Enttäuschung: die Kapuze. Da es sich bei dieser Jacke um eine REGENjacke handelt, ist die Kapuze von großer Bedeutung. Warum man diese dann nicht sinnvoll konstruiert, ist mir ein Rätsel. Erstens: die vordere Kante des Schirms der Kapuze reicht bei offenem Zustand gerade mal etwas über die Linie der Nasenspitze hinaus (vertikal betrachtet). Was heißt das bei Regen? Es regnet direkt ins Gesicht, keine Chance, sich abzuschirmen. Wenn man die Kapuze über den Verstellzug an der Kopfhinterseite fester zurrt, zieht es den Schirm noch näher an den Kopf (erinnert an den Schirm der Preussischen Pickelhauben). Lässt man den Verstellzug locker, reicht der Schirm zwar etwas weiter über das Gesicht nach vorne, dann bläst allerdings jeder Windstoß die Kapuze vom Kopf. Das nennt man Design, das am Papier gemacht wurde.  Und dann ist da noch die Verstellung der Kapuze: abgesehen davon, dass diese ausschließlich über die Kopfhinterseite erfolgen kann, ist das Band mit dem Griffstück derart filigran, dass es selbst mit meinen Künstlerhänden kein Leichtes ist, dieses zu bedienen. Ich will gar nicht wissen, wie das mit Handschuhen funktionieren soll. Wie gesagt, beim Festzurren zieht es einem dank der sinnbefreiten Verlegung der Kordel die Kapuze ins Gesicht und legt dieses schön frei, damit es freudig darauf regnen kann. Und wenn man den Zug wieder lockern will, weiß man nicht, wo man anziehen soll, denn es gibt keine Kordel zu sehen, die man ziehen könnte (ich habe irgendwo an der Außenkante der Kapuze herumgezerrt, das hat die Kordel etwas gelockert).  Bei solchen Details fragt man sich, ob es so schwer sein kann, Outdoor-Produkte zu entwickeln, die funktionieren?",17

Il primo obiettivo è raggiunto all'80%, il secondo al 50%. Quanto al look, si vede che è un capo da trekking, anche se il taglio è lineare e i loghi sono poco visibili (praticamente grigio scurissimo su nero, quasi non si vedono). A proposito di un utilizzo trekking: - molto utili le zip per la ventilazione sotto le ascelle, sarebbe stato utile avere la zip frontale con doppio cursore per poterla aprire da sotto e far uscire calore in eccesso senza perdere protezione dalla pioggia, - la flap che dovrebbe coprire la zip principale non ha né velcro né bottoni per essere tenuta chiusa (non è un problema per l'uso che intendevo farne io ma ho seri dubbi sul suo utilizzo sotto un acquazzone in montagna perché la zip potrebbe far entrare acqua se il flap non la protegge), - quando la zip è tutta chiusa, il mento è direttamente a contatto con il tessuto esterno, non c'è una mentoniera più morbida come in molte altre giacche, questa è minimalista come dice il nome.",2

This jacket uses gore-tex paclite, so the jacket is quite light and folds down small for easy carry. The hood is also very good, a single drawcord pulls the hood in, and the hood moves with your head.  Paclite is not the most breathable of the gore-tex materials and can wet out quickly. To help mitigate this, the jacket has underarm pit zips which work well.",2

Pros: - Price for a Gore-Tex rain jacket. - Enough room for layering.",
