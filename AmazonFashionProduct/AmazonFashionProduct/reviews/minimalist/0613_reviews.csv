Just got them today. Will take time to know how my feet like them or if they will be something I wear often. But so far really enjoying the feel. Toe room is nice. Only bummer was the strings used to tighten are attached to a sticky thing that connects to shoe to keep them from moving all around. One of the strings on my right shoe ripped off as soon as I went to tighten the clasp. So that sucks. But what can you do… nothings perfect.,

I did some more research and settled on these after they were nominated as one of the best barefoot sneaker on a review website. I received them today and absolutely LOVE them!  Use the Euro size chart for sizing. If you’re not sure, trace your foot on paper, measure it and convert the inches to the Euro size on a conversion site (Google it).Anywho… these shoes are so comfortable! I don’t even feel like I’m going to have to break them in. They have plenty of room in the toe box and there are no seams that press into my foot. I don’t have a “true” wide foot so I’m not sure if they’re actually wide or if it’s just wide in the toe box bc the middle and back of the shoe fits like a glove. I’m not a fan of the elastic laces but twirled them around and secured them so they don’t stick up on top of the shoe. It works and isn’t a deal breaker. I went out on a limb and bought the aqua blue but was a little hesitant bc they looked so bright in the pic. However, when I got them they are perfect. Yes, they’re bright but look amazing on my feet. They slip on and off easily enough and really are indeed slip resistant. They have some arch support but not a lot. If I was truly barefoot, I would have no arch support so it’s not an important feature.  I’m not sure about the durability but even if they only last 6 months, I can buy a new pair and still spend less than one pair of all other name brand sneakers.  I will definitely buy more of these shoes!  Don’t hesitate… BUY THEM!",

Kindle Customer,New colors in the Velcro version! Yay!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TUD5YDXRYHWF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DTK7FK2M,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: 9-9.5Color: W20 | Red,Verified Purchase,"Thank you for the new colors in the velcro version! I'm so excited! Got my first pair in May of 2019. The purple and black velcro version. Immediately got the orange. I love these shoes! I came from very expensive, built up shoes for my narrow, flat feet. Had expensive orthotics as well. Lots of lower back, hip and knee pain. Finally started getting what looked and felt like a bunion. Dr. Google suggested minimalist wide toe box shoes. Tried the joomra's and I've never looked back. I have also tried lots of different wide toe box brands that are sold here on Amazon and always had to return them. The Joomra's (aka Whitin's) with the velcro straps are the only ones that work for me. The tongue on the non velcro version is irritating. I've bought every color of the velcro version that they've had. That's why I'm so excited for the new colors. I still have and still wear the ones I bought in 2019. I rotate them weekly. Also still can't beat the price. I think they were thirty something dollars when I first bought them. Previous shoes, I was lucky if one pair was $160. $180 to $200 was the norm. Now I can get three shoes for that price. My knee and hip pain are gone. Cons: There is a learning curve to walking in them. Can't do the hard heel strike with minimalist shoes. There's also a learning curve in feeling every rock, stick and pebble. Now I don't even notice. The one downside of no padding is the bottom of my feet can be a little sore by the end of the day. My job has a concrete floor. PS- I've had to replace a couple of the insoles. The whitin store used to sell the yellow ones that come in the shoes. Now they only have a blue version that's a little different. I'll have to see how they work out. Also, try toe socks- game changer.",

I am a seasoned marathon runner and I own around 25 pairs of different runners, that are all in use.

They all have different cushioning, different heel to toe and different toe boxes, that challenge the muscles in my feet, legs…in different ways.  The Joomra minimalist shoes should be used sparingly to begin with, to give yourself time to get used to the different pounding of your feet.  I am not sure I would use these shoes for trail running. They have next to no cushioning, zero ankle support and I am not sure that I would trust the sole should I hit a sharp stone.

I just had surgery so I can't drive which made finding a way to drop them off difficult but paying to return them isn't a big deal since I'd get the correct size in the end. I received my replacement order and turns out I was given the same size. Kind of a waste of time at this point so I will just give them away.  These have been sitting in my cart for awhile so it really does suck that it didn't work out. In this case I got what I paid for.
