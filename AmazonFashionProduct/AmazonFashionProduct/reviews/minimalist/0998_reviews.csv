Super comfy on my tootsies with the wide toe box, and they look really nice on the feet. They have really nice ground feel with really good traction but, can still glide as well as any sneakers. They’re my new favorite dancing shoes and they have loops to allow the laces to actually hold them in place while you’re really cutting the rug. Heck by the time you engage the ribbons of destiny the rug should have been burned to a crisp 😉. Really comfy, flexible but not sloppy/floppy or sock eaters. Great for walking too; I just got the music in my soul and I can’t even walk boring 🎭. If you don’t remember anything else I write here never forget this next bit. I love you and there’s nothing you can do about it. Yep, I don’t know you, never met you and it’s likely we’re never going to meet. I can still guarantee, absolutely beyond the shadow of any doubt that I not only love you but care about you too. You are beautiful and deserve happiness. Create connections and spread joy ☮️ 🐿️🐝🫂",

It's a solid option for a barefoot shoe. However, there are some seams on the inside of the shoe that you can feel even with a sock on, if you choose to wear a sock, that aren't the most comfortable. Also of note is that I found I was mildly allergic to whatever the lining is made of, though I don't know who else would ever experience that. If I wear socks it's fine but if I try to wear these barefoot it's no bueno.  The bottom of the shoe is also weirdly sticky, sort of like an old school bounce-ball you'd get out of a vending machine, and within a few minutes of walking through my house I was sliding around from all the dog hair stuck to my shoe. This is probably a plan C for me that I'll keep on hand for mowing the lawn but probably won't wear regularly due to the interior seams and weird sole.",

They’re a little more rigid than some brands I’ve tried, which I prefer at this point because I am just starting this barefoot thing. My favorite part is that the tow box is wider than other shoes I’ve tried, and the shape of the toe makes it look like an actual shoe, not a water shoe. I have bunions and my big toe sits up pretty high. When wearing the style that outlines your toes on the front the fabric was tight on my toes, like it would rip off the rubber easily.

TA,"A nice lightweight ""barefoot"" shoe",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NG71H84GLKYF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CS92C2MY,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 16, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I bought the white and within 48 hours, I was ordering the navy, black, gray and tan.  I wear a women's 9.5, wide. I ordered size 10 and it fit like I want it to. I think had I gotten a 9, my toe would've been right in the tip of the shoe. The ten leaves me about a thumbs space between my big toe and the tip of the shoe.  While still more of a sneaker than shoe, it's not so sneaker looking that it looks weird with business casual wear.  Not a lot of cushion, but there's not supposed to be in a barefoot shoe, though the mildly cushioned insole keeps it from feeling like you're pounding on cement when doing daily walking or standing. Not sure how they'd fare doing heavy duty walking, personally, my footfall is too heavy and the terrain is such that I've yet to find a barefoot shoe good for that level of impact.  The laces are functional though I didn't need to tighten mine.  Plenty of room for foot splay. This is a true wide shoe. If you don't actually wear wide width, you'll probably find your foot moves around in it too much. I worried the toe box being so wide, that they'd look like flippers but they don't look like Ronald McDonald's feet when I look down and others have complimented them so I guess they don't look weird to others either.  Comfortable with and without socks.  Appear to be machine washable though I haven't attempted cleaning them yet.  Great price, I'm coming back for the remaining three colors.",11

I wanted to get some lightweight shoes and something a bit more comfortable, so when I came across these I thought they looked awesome. I love that the toe is wider instead of becoming more narrow like most shoes are. I placed an order for them and they arrived very quickly. Now, first let me say that these aren’t a high priced shoe so don’t expect them to be made extremely well. But, they are still pretty good quality All things considered. They look pretty nice, the fabric seems durable enough and the soles are pretty thick to where thet should definitely have some longevity to them. But Actually, my favorite feature of these is how wide the front toe part is! Usually, when I am walking a lot or using my exercise bike, my toes get crunched up in. They’re always really sore by the end of my session. With these, it is extra wide, and even though they look a little bit funny, they feel absolutely amazing. Definitely a game changer and something I am really, really happy about. The price point is actually really great For what you get so I can very confidently recommend these to you as a pretty solid purchase. I hope my review helps you to make a more well informed decision.",

On all those counts, these shoes will be more than adequate.  Specifically, I like the wider fit. Although not typically a need for me, feet tend to swell when traveling, and the extra room feels good. The length could have been a half size longer, at least on one shoe, so fit wasn’t exactly true, but not a deal breaker.  Very little structure in this shoe, which is my preference, but may not be suitable for those needing extra support. For me, the closer to bare feet the better, and these do the trick.  The material is synthetic but mostly mesh, so ventilation shouldn’t be a problem. The soles are textured and I have no problem with the traction.  For the price, these offer what I need and a good value.",2

These looked attractive because of the wide toe box and forefoot shape was very similar to my favorite 'Terra Plana Root' shoe (no longer available). I thought the knit looked comfortable and breathable.  I don't really fit wides, but I like the wide toe box. I ordered my normal size (US 10, EU 43) wide. Fit is just about right but the heel isn't tight (as expected). Because the heel is loose I don't feel comfortable wearing them without the laces, it lets my foot slide forward.  I tried them on without the insole. They still have a thin foam pad that is non-removable. The fit was too loose though. I think I might have to order a size down if I wanted to wear them without insoles, and I think the large toe box would make the smaller size still wearable. The insoles themselves are a soft foam, and are a bit thicker in the heel section. Doesn't feel like zero drop to me.  Most of the fabric is non-stretchy except the section around the ankle. I like the fabric look of the toe and forefoot, but the PU leather and side stripes remind me of cheap hi-tops. They looked better in the product photos. The knit is pretty breathable, but just the pattern area at the top of the toes and near the laces. I took a photo with a flashlight inside so you can see where it is open.  Sole rubber is very grippy. I find the heel section a bit too flat and wide. It makes we want to walk with a wider stance as it forces my foot flat early. Would prefer some curve like a normal heel.  The sole doesn't have any external stitches to the upper. I couldn't tell if the stitches inside went through the sole. If it is only glued I worry that it might not hold up in the long term, but that remains to be seen. Their 80k bend test sounds encouraging at least.  The pull-on loops seems solidly attached, and I find pulling them on really easy so they probably won't get stressed anyway.  Shoes are pretty light, around 260g per shoe, with the insole being 15g of that.  All in all, pretty happy. Construction feels above par for this price point. Same for the materials except the PU leather on the heel outer. I'm tempted to go back for a smaller pair that I can slip on without laces.",6

I like that they are comfortable enough to wear around the house and that the extra allotted toe space is more roomy than most walking shoes.

I wanted a pair of casual slip on shoes for summer for at the lake or just running around town in. Something easy on and easy off, breathable and comfortable to wear without the need for socks if I choose not to. Comsidering what they are listed at too I was good with them ending up being discarded after putting them to good use for a summer and into fall. I have been really pleased not only with how lightweight they are and give me the extra room I need for my toes but the material feel on my bare feet as well. I don't notice any irritation from the fabric in terms of rubbing against my ankles or the interior of the shoes from the seams or stitching at all. The shoes hug my feet and feel soft inside from when I slip them on until I take them off.  The shoes do have a decent enough insert pad that feels cushy but I wouldn't say it's overly thick and to be honest I don't think there is any if only very minimal at best arch support. So it could be an issue for some guys but probably fixable with better inserts. While the decription of the shoes mentions them being ""perfect"" for high intensity activities like running, jogging, aerobic exercise and even hiking, I don't think they have the cushioning or proper support required to absorb the impact. I know for the kind of hiking I normally do my feet would be a mess and in bad shape after the miles I'd put on if I wore these lol.  For casual use something that feels like slippers or at just really comfortable they fit the bill whether I'm at the lake, running my errands on the weekends, going on a leisurely bike ride, taking a walk, or even just when I need to run outside quick for something. Fit wise I'd say they are true to size. My big toe doesn't quite reach the end of the shoe.",
