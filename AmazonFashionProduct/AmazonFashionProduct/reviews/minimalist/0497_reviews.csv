The value is incredible. My favorite part about these shoes is that it has a heel pad. It also has really good traction on the bottom so if you’re looking for a good, comfortable slip resistant shoe this is it. I also appreciate the style of these shoes! My other “barefoot” or “minimalist” shoes made it look like I had clown shoes on. Somehow these look a lot more normal, even as the toe box has plenty of room. I ordered two more pairs in two other colors because it is SO HARD for me to find shoes that fit well. I’m a PE teacher and am on my feet a lot- these kept me pain free in my feet, knees, hips, and back. Didn’t wake up the next mornings stiff and certainly didn’t have any achey joints. Highly recommend.  I will side note that there is always going to be a transition period for “minimalist” shoes… so if you’re new to this kind of style give your body some time to adjust.",8

I would suggest if you aren’t used to a barefoot style shoe. Wear them for short distance to start out with. Just to get your feet and body used to a more flexible shoe. Over all worth the money.,

The only downside I experienced is a bit of an allergic reaction to something in the uppers.  That was only a problem while they were new though.  They're definitely worth the price and continue to look good, other than being stained that is. lol. They are far more resilient than the expensive pair I wore previously.  Highly recommend.",4

When you consider the comfort, style, slip resistance, support, all weather use, and the value when compared to other shoes of this type they are practically perfect. I will be ordering more colors as they are also great for casual days out. Also if you order half a size larger because of width, the toe box is very comfortable and accommodates your foot to the point you can order your true size. Awesome",

I heard a podcast about the importance of zero drop, wide toe box shoes with flexible soles that allow the foot to move as it was intended,  and this shoe checks all the boxes.  I recently went on vacation and only brought these shoes so that I would have no choice but to put them to the test.  I logged in ~21,000 to 22,000 steps per day on roads, sidewalks, in museums, etc on hard surface and they passed the test!  They don't have a name brand on them and maybe this bothered me a little, if I'm being honest.  However, at the end of the vacation days, the people I went with all had aching feet, took off their shoes ASAP and rubbed their feet, complaining of pain and normally that would be me as well, but it wasn't thanks to these shoes!

I am someone who is always on their feet and I love to be outside on trails, hiking, walks through the neighborhood, etc. and these shoes are EXTREMELY comfortable. My foot is able to completely and comfortably stretch while walking. I do not recommend sizing up though as some have suggested, they are quite roomy especially after you start breaking them in. I love the fact that there is a thin sole so I am able to feel the ground, however that comes with some negatives as well because there is little protection if you step on a rock lol. They do take some getting used to and after the first couple walks my foot felt like I just put it through a clothes ringer. I have felt the muscles in my feet get stronger in just this short amount of time though. If you have problems with your arches hurting, or just hate tight shoes, I highly recommend, though be warned about the beginning process.",11

Amazing fit and feel. I put these on for the first time on the day I received them-which also happened to be the day I received a cortisone shot in each foot for my first bout of major plantar fasciitis. Some stuff you read says zero drop actually helps with foot issues so I was excited to try them. They are wonderful shoes for biking (lots of grip and room in the toes, breathable but not too cold)! Also I wore them to work with pants (desk job), and also to workout indoors (weights, bike, a little treadmill). I’m not sure yet if I would walk lots and lots of miles in them just yet (waiting for my plantar to heal a bit more) . I already ordered another pair in a different color! Great great price for such a well made comfortable shoe! I absolutely love the padding on the back of the heel (fits me perfect unlike most shoes), lots of width so toes/forefoot is not cramped whatsoever, super lightweight with sturdy grippy sole and some cushion (but can still be responsive to what is under your foot). I also love no tongue (no bulk at all) and the sock-like way it hugs below your ankle. They are secure and don’t flop around at all but they also don’t squish or hurt any area of the foot. I don’t know how they do it but at this price and quality, I will continue to buy. The laces are short. The shoe looks “ok” -probably not gorgeous and mega flattering but at this stage I’m about comfort. They do not add much height at all of course (not an overly cushioned shoe) .",

However the sole isn't that thick. I'm not sure how thick it measures but just pressing my finger on the inside I can feel the floor on the tip of my finger. So for wearing these to work standing for long periods of time I'm not sure I'll be able to tolerate it since it feels like I'm basically standing barefoot. However the tread on the soles is 100% I've worn these in super slick winter conditions and didn't slip once! I really do believe these would make great hiking shoes like advertised, I was just hoping to make them work shoes.",5

I’m happy to report, other than the ugly color, I’m quite pleased with my purchase and couldn’t ask for a more comfortable and natural feeling shoe.  It really does feel like I’m walking barefoot without any sticks or stones biting into my soles.  They also seem to be holding up well, although I haven’t had them long but have given them quite a workout.",
