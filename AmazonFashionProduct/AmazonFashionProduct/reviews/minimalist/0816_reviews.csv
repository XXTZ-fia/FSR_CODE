It is so worth the money when you compare it to the over priced brand that it's modeled after.

The RFID-blocking technology is also a great feature, providing peace of mind in today’s digital world. It’s clear that Vanta Vault took a page out of more expensive brands’ books, like the Ridge, but managed to deliver a comparable product for a fraction of the cost.

On Amazon that you can buy to learn if you like them or not. From just looking it looks like a good wallet. But I’ve used it the cheaper ones and I’ve used the much more expensive ones. And a wallet is not as good as the cheaper ones.  The size is the same, and the capacity is the same, but it’s just not a very good build.

It holds my cards all pretty security and makes them easy to get at by having an indent you can use to push them out the opposite side. The outer shells are some kind of annealed metal and look just like they do in the photos. The inner shells are also metal (I expected plastic so bonus points!)  It's all held together by an elastic band. This is the one spot of worry I have. I don't know how long the elastic will last before it becomes worn out or just brittle.

The wallet is a bit larger than the cards inside, so it is unobtrusive if you like a small wallet, and the money clip can be easily removed using the enclosed screwdriver. The reason I knocked one star off is because removing the cards for use is awkward.

Erich M,Vanta Vault - Titanium Edition - Will it be your EDC?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YB81B427KW18/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D76ZCDJV,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 12, 2024",Color: Titanium,,"Long before ""every day carry"" and ""minimalist wallet"" were added to the popular lexicon, I have carried a slim, all-leather ""pocket"" to hold cash and cards. The years have caught up to it, so it was time to investigate something new.  The Vanta Vault is in the category of ""sandwich"" card holders: two plates pulled together by an elasticized band with a cut-out for card access. If you already know you like this style of minimalist wallet, thoughtful design details contribute to a sense of quality in this product. - All metal design, with a black-anodized, machined aluminum internal plates and bolted-on titanium covers. - The internal plates are chamfered on the edge where cards slide in, allowing a card to slide in with ease. - The matte-finish titanium covers are beveled on all sides, blending gracefully into the edge. - The blueing of the metal is not a painted-on coloring, but appears to be integral to the metal. - While every effort had been made to reduce the size, the construction is rigid and the assembled unit gave no signs of deflection or deformation while applying moderate stress. - Securely holds from 1 to a dozen cards with effective RFID reader blocking.  My criticisms are not specific to the Vanta Vault, but apply generally to this style of ""card sandwich"" wallet. - The elastic strap is an the obvious Achilles heel of the setup, as it will undoubtedly lose its elasticity as it ages. A failure of the strap would result in the contents falling out freely. - The smooth outer surfaces left me nervous that it would be more likely to slide out of a pocket than a a leather wallet. - If the card you're looking for is not on the end of the stack, all the cards need to come out. While not deal-breakers, they make for a different experience that a traditional wallet where cards are sorted into pockets.  For me, it may not be my EDC, but I can give the Vanta Vault no less than 5 stars for its attractive design, satisfying craftsmanship and overall top-notch execution of the sandwich style of minimalist wallet. At this price point, it can't be beat.  Photo: Tear-down shows, from the top, two internal plates (0.1"" thick each), two titanium covers (0.036"" thick each), 2.0mm hex-head driver, the internal elastic strap, instruction card, package of screws (includes 4 extra), cash strap, and the metal money clip. Overall thickness when empty is about 0.270"".",4
Scott,Solid choice for a minimalist wallet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KYER7OEOU0GS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D76ZCDJV,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 12, 2024",Color: Titanium,,"I had been curious to try a Ridge wallet but was turned off by the high price, especially considering I wasn't sure if this was the right type of wallet for me. Instead I decided to try a low cost alternative, just to see whether I could work without all the extra stuff I usually carry around.  This Vanta Vault wallet came in a box along with a screwdriver to allow you to remove the plates. This lets you switch between the metallic money clip or the elastic strap. I chose the strap so there's less chance of getting hooked on my pocket.  The construction feels solid and it looks nice. There was enough room for a fair amount of cards, as well as for my Pebblebee tracker. So far it seems to be working well.  I'm still trying to determine whether or not I like this form factor of wallet in general, and the Vanta Vault is a perfect way to test this out before making a big investment on a name brand. And honestly I don't think there is much of a reason to even go with a name brand other than if there's some design you really like: this will get the job done just fine.",

It is much slimmer than your typical leather wallet.",
Samie May,Nice! Has extra screws.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AQZAQ1FWSUX2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D76ZCDJV,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 6, 2024",Color: Titanium,,"Hubby needed a new hard wallet because a screw feel out of his current model. So, first off, this comes with extra screws and a custom screwdriver. If you lose a screw, you don't have to throw the whole thing out. Outside of that, it's a standard hard case wallet. I really like the mirror/holographic finish on it.",2
Andrew Vuktilaj,Great price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1V4VXXOOWARW7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D76ZCDJV,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 1, 2024",Color: Carbon Fiber,Verified Purchase,The fit and finish of the Wallet is of the highest quality. The carbon fiber is perfectly polished. The money clip works perfectly. There is a free screwdriver included with the wallet and it’s not some cheap throw away item. This wallet will last for years to come and for the price this is an amazing purchase you won’t regret it.,2
S. Anglesey,Great for cash and maybe two cards,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM2A2GQ2O0ZJH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D76ZCDJV,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 16, 2024",Color: Carbon Fiber,,"This wallet looks really nice right out of the box. It comes with the money clip as well as the band, which is very nice. I actually prefer the band over the money clip. It can hold a lot of cards, like six or so, but it is hard to fan the cards out. I prefer using it with just a couple of cards and some money in the band. If you like money clips, this is one of the nicer ones. It is wide and strong, so no fear of losing any money.",
joey l,Nice wallet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4IZUFPLC7UCU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D76ZCDJV,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 11, 2024",Color: Carbon Fiber,,I am impressed with the quality of this wallet. I primarily got it to use as a business card holder but I may switch over to using it as my wallet. It is well made and looks good. The included screw driver is also nice. I do like how you receive a money clip as well as a strap you can change to.,2
