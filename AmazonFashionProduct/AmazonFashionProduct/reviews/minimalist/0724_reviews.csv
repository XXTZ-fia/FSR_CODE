All your cards are tightly held in the middle as a deck of cards. So you have to search for the one you want. The cards are held by an elastic band which is fairly tight. I'm a credit card optimizer so I carry 5 different ones. It isn't impossible to fan them all out but it's definitely not as easy as a wallet with pockets.

Its RFID-blocking capability safeguards against data theft, a necessity in today’s digital age.  However, while sleek, the wallet’s minimalist design does not cater to those who need to carry more than a few cards and some cash. The limited storage capacity is a dealbreaker if you require more from your wallet. In my experience, the two plates that squeeze tightly together ought to be thinner. My wife can not extract a single card from this wallet. I often feel like I’m performing a feat of strength to gain access to a credit card, and I’m 6’0” and 205 pounds.

So if you are looking for ultra-slim, then get a wallet that doesn't bother with a money-clip. The money-clip on this WXM wallet is strong and tight. To the point of requiring substantial force in order to flex it open with your bare hand. I regard the strength of this money-clip to be beneficial.  Unlike a leather or cloth wallet, the metal money-clip allows this wallet to be retrieved by hook or magnet, if you have to fish it out of a crevice or a shallow pond.  The fit and finish of the parts is superb. Looks like quality control has been achieved. But being black, it will be easy to lose it in plain sight if it gets left on top of something that is just as black.  Cards are easily inserted by forcing a corner of a card between the 2 outside plates. Once a card is wedged past the plates by even the slightest amount, the rest of the card is easily driven home with ease. Removing just one care requires that all the cards be forced out using the thumb recess. Doing so exposes a wedge of the card stack, which can then be ""fanned open"" by pinching the stack between your thumb and index finger, and then bending the fan of cards, like a deck of cards, to single out the card you want, and separate it from the rest. Piece of cake.",

What I don't like:  It is NOT easy to get the cards in and out of this thing, at least not when it's brand new. The ad says you can fit up to 15 cards in here. I have seven and it's very difficult to get them in and out. Granted, they are SECURE in this thing, but not easily accessible.  The money clip is somewhat bulky...see picture. It's nice to have but sticks out a little more than I think it needs to in order to be useful.  There is no outside window or separate pocket for a drivers license or ID card that can be removed quickly and easily.  Overall, this is a decent product, and if you can get past the things that I didn't like, then you're good with this. The RFID blocking quality of this wallet is what made me decide to try it out. I actually broke my previous wallet while taking the cards out to test this one, so now it's my primary carry wallet. I would prefer to keep this as a travel wallet. When I travel outside of the US, I leave most things in the safe at the hotel, and only carry a single lower limit credit card and my passport card, plus some local cash, and this would be perfect for that.

Under that is a carbon fiber piece that compliments the aluminum perfectly, and under that is yet another piece of aluminum. The money clip is heavy duty and has a very tight hold so that your bills won't fall out in your pocket. The section that holds the credit cards expands but keeps a tight hold on all your cards, even if there's only one in there.

The wallet has a quick release on the airtag cage so it is easy to mount and unmount.  It's also heavy. Between plastic, aluminum, carbon, and all the other bits, this thing is heavy even before you put anything in it. Add in a few cards and 10 bills of cash and it's about an inch thick. It feels nicely made though. For contrast, the wallet I usually use can hold the same and come out about 3/4"" with the same stuff. Though that means using a flat card style ""find my"" device instead of an official airtag.

It does hold quite a few credit cards (about 10 or so) along with my Driver's License, but all the cards stack directly on top of each other which makes it very thick. But that's not the biggest problem with the wallet. The fact that the card slots are smaller than the credit cards you put in them making it nearly impossible to get the cards back out is the problem. I've even tried inserting something thick, like a ruler, to loosen up the pockets but that doesn't work. So while the wallet condenses my cards into a smaller space, the fact that you can't get the cards out is the deal breaker for me. Maybe mine was just a defective unit, but it's still hard to believe there isn't a little more tolerance for the size of the credit cards to make it easier to get them in and out while keeping them securely snug in the wallet.

S. Finch,Great product. It shields your cards.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HQ0EXE9GOUHX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VCJMZXC,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 22, 2024",Color: Airtag Wallet Black,Verified Purchase,"Great product. Works as stated. Too bad you can’t lock In the AirTag. With a wrench instead of a thumb switch. Yes they could eventually take it out with a wrench, but with the thumb switch, they can easily pop it out. They’ve already taken your money and they’ve thrown this thing out.  The point of this, is if you miss-place your wallet you’ll be able to track it down.",
