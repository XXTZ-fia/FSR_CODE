I like how the push button raises the cards in a staggered manner, though the button takes a firm push to activate.

I am one of those guys who would typically buy those massive leather wallets, store as much as I could in them and kept them for years and years. The nice thing about wallets like these is it forces you to clean up your wallet and not carry every single card you own on the planet. The locking feature works well and when unlocked, the cards come up smoothly staggered. I can see every card easily, and am able to access it conveniently. It comes with a metal clip that can be installed on the inside flap for cash (comes with a small screwdriver and extra screws).
