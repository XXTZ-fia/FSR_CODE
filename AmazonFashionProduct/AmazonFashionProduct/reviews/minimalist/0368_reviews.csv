C.

I try my best to stick to zero-drop barefoot style shoes for him, so his feet can grow properly, and because he loves to climb and needs to feel with his feet properly to climb safely. Affordability cn be a challenge, and these were reasonable enough. I was so happy to find a pair with a high-top fit, to keep more sand, mulch, etc. out of his shoes on the playgrounds.  Buying new shoes like this online is always hit or miss for quality - the last pair I spent $30 on had the stitching unraveling within days, but these are sturdy (without being less flexible or more padded) and the stitching is well done. No issues at all with the sole seal - stitching and sole being the main weak points I look for. The materials themselves are solid, the sole thick enough to protect and last without losing the zero drop foot feel he needs, and the upper being thick, sturdy, and breathable, not a flimsy fabric like some brands we've tried.  They are easy enough for my 3 year old to put on by himself, which he vastly prefers, and comfortable enough he doesn't want to take them off. I might wish they had more color options, but the high ankle-covering style was more important than letting kiddo pick fun colors, and he's quite happy with the black, which goes with everything.",2

The sole is thin so if you are going over rougher terrain you will feel the jaggedness of every rock and groove. They flex with your feet and have a simple velcro design. If your feet are more narrow then the strap will be too large and you will not have the perfect length of the strap aesthetic, especially if you do not want the tongue of the shoe moving around too much.

TJ,My 6 year old loves these barefoot style shoes!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PTW86UWJSPW4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBLS83ZB,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 22, 2024",Size: 3.5 Big KidColor: Light Grey,,"I got these KUBUA Kids High Top Barefoot Shoes for my 6 year old son because I noticed he was wanting to be barefoot all the time and his shoes were smooshing his feet. After wearing once to school, he loves them so much that he takes them over his favorite cartoon character shoes every day. He says they make him feel the ground's bumps and it is neat. He also thinks it makes him run faster like a ninja haha. I am not sure about all that but glad he find them comfortable enough to wear them everyday to school.  As for sizing, I went with a size 3 in big kids but they seem to run about a 1/2 size larger roughly than his other shoes. The shoes hug a bit so this doesn't seem to affect him and allows for plenty of room to grow. At the same time the toe box is wider than usual which help his toes spread out for better balance and are more anatomical. He can put them on and take them off easily but they stay on while running and playing.  The shoes are flexible and contour to the different textures of the ground you're walking on. Overall, super happy with these and would get again when he grows out of these especially if they are on sale since they are on the more expensive side for kids shoes. I will update with how long they last.",10

This isn’t medical advice but as a person with low vision it’s nice to have your preferences met within your footwear choices. There’s wonderfully placed soft bumpy dots on the inside which add a relaxing sensation to your feet so they don’t get sore from the barefoot lifestyle so quickly. I love that I can feel where the edge of a step is. These shoes have flexibility which aligns with the dexterity of your own feet. Your toes are protected really well by the bumpers build into the soles. The soles also have such good traction that you’ll almost stop on contact when you’re ready to stop running. The ankle has wonderful padding as well which is one of my favourite features about these shoes.,5

He loves that the sole is thin and sticking. He likes the simple Velcro at top. He loves the style.  The material quality is good. The glue and stitch seem good. The velcro strap is good quality and so is the loop.  The soles are quite thin which also for more flexibly and ground feel, but it comes at the cost of easier punctures and quicker wearing.  The sizing is a bit large. If your kid is a perfect sized 1, these are somewhere between 1-1.5. Not a huge difference and the sizing if favorable for foot growth.
