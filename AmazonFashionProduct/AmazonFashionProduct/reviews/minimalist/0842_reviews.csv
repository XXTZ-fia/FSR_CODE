Lo único que me pareció algo negativo es que al ser un tenis blanco hecho con un tejido, la limpieza es más difícil y engorroso.",

Blake,Terrible,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16VE7NGDQN4RA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D54V4BVF,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 4, 2024",Size: 8Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"Terrible shoes, they dont have a wide toe box, ""wider"" than most, i guess but barely.  They are closer to a barefoot shoe than normal shoes yes but when i say they are too tight i mean too tight.  I normally wear a size 8.5 so thats what i ordered, however i had at least a whole inch of room left till my toes reach the end of the shoe but the top of the shoe was so damn tight it was so uncomfortable. The 8.5 was more like a 7.5 height wise so if you want these get a size bigger but dont forget you will have like 2 or more inches of room left in the length of the shoe so almost like clown shoes, youll be tripping over your own feet.  They are just not for me.  You will need a short and long foot to wear these shoes comfortably.  If you have a high arch, find something else, if you have a normal foot, find something else.  Also took 2 weeks after amazon processed my return package to get my refund so about 2.5-3 weeks for me to get my money back to my amazon balance.",

Love using it in the gym but it gets dirty incredibly easy.  Walking outside for a bit and my white shoes turn brown from all the dust and dirt. If you're thinking of picking it up, don't pick white unless you want to spend your evenings cleaning up the shoe.",

Great for the gym lifts I needed it for. I hate doing legs with running shoes or vans/converse with narrow toes.

R. Liechty,"Not for extra wide, high instep feet",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R277XOOY072B3Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D54V4BVF,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 26, 2024",Size: 6.5Color: Orion Blue,Verified Purchase,"Good quality but didn't work for my extra wide foot since it was tight on the sides. Also, it is too tight on top of the foot for someone with a high instep unless you remove the shoe's provided insert. Would have been perfect (with removed inserts) if just a little bit wider. I returned but would recommend for a normal or normal wide foot owner.",

I was expecting a harder transition but 2 weeks in, it's been good. I've noticed various aches and pains which I am putting down to the lower tread (3mm).
