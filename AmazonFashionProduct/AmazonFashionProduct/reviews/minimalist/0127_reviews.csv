I’m not one to wear expensive jewelry, or much jewelry at all. But sometimes I do like to wear something. These have some flash while still being masculine (at least in the widest size) and to my eye are very tasteful. The design is simple, and as I said it feels pretty masculine for such a flashy thing. Who knows what the durability will be, but at the price I’m very happy with however long it lasts. I’m more likely to lose it before it wears out. LOL I feel sick if I bought and lost the Chanel version.",4
