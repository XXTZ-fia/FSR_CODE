I would not be able to get my instep into the shoes.  The shoes are nice looking, and seem to be well made, but wide they are not; and won’t accept a high instep.  I can’t say anything about support, comfort, durability, or walking ability as I couldn’t get them on.",

Also, I wear them without socks and without the insole, and the fabric under my feet have like a velvety kind of texture, I really like how that feels against the bottom of my feet.  Walking in them is so much fun, I found myself randomly going for long walks, heehee.  I also like that you can adjust the tension with the laces without having to tie them. Though I do miss slip-ons, since I take them off as soon as I get indoors, so I spend an extra 5 seconds getting these on and off. But other than that, I have no complaints :)",2

But these are just great!  The elastic laces make for quick on and off while keeping the shoe secure on my foot; they're not really runners, but you can jog back out to the car to grab something you forgot without it becoming a workout just to keep the shoes on.  The soles are holding up nicely, and I think I've probably put about 50-70 miles on them, just doing our usual dog walking and theme park trips!  I was a little worried about the material, but in person, it looks normal, so I htink it was just one of the pictures that was putting me off at first.",

I purchased a size 11 and my normal foot size is a 10.5 and I thought these would be too big but they’re not. They give you just enough room and still feel comfortable without walking weird. The style is great and exactly for a barefoot sneaker. The bottoms are the perfect thickness and slip resistant. The material feels very durable but I may still want to spray them to prevent staining. I really like the rubber on the laces to tighten them — this is so you can either slip them n and go or you can tie the laces tight. Another thing I love is that you can remove the padded/cork insole to go fully barefoot and flat. They really thought that and the attention to detail is there. I really recommend these sneakers to anyone looking for a high quality barefoot sneaker but a fraction of the price. I’m already looking to purchase another pair and it’s only been 24 hours. I will make a video and post it shortly.,13

They look very wide due to a narrow heel cup, but if you actually have wide feet, you may be disappointed. My feet aren't even that wide and I often wear ""standard"" sized shoes, but I can feel my toes against both sides of the toe box in these shoes. When I held them up to a pair of standard Skechers, the toe box is the same width. It's just the heel is narrower on these. The length is perfect, so I wouldn't want to go up a size. They just aren't as wide as they look.  The toe box is also kind of short, vertically. Without the insole, there is room. With the insole in the shoe it feels a bit crowded.  I love the versatility of these shoes. The included insoles do a good job of absorbing shock without being mushy or squishing down. Taking them out gives a pretty barefoot-like experience. The sole is flexible, but firm. It doesn't absorb much energy as you walk.  The style is nice. I've been complimented on how the navy color coordinates with blue jeans. I like that there is a sole color other than white! White soles look dirty instantly. These brown soles hide the dirt better.  Breathability seems fine. My feet are often hot but I don't think I've ever found a shoe that actually breathes enough for me. These are comparable to other ""breathable"" casual shoes.",3

A set of shoestrings were housed in a ziplock bag.  The shoes were wrapped in tissue paper.These shoes redefine walking comfort with their wide toe box and zero-drop sole, offering a natural fit that feels like a second skin.  Side note:  I love wide and square toe shoes.  That's all I've looked for for decades, since discovering their existence.The breathable cotton fabric keeps things cool, while the collapsible heel makes them as versatile as slippers.  Elastic laces make slipping them on a breeze, and the durable rubber soles ensure they can handle whatever terrain you throw at them.Barefoot?  No way.  I don't need a toxic zone here.  Well, allegedly no funky foot odors here - just pure, unadulterated comfort.  The shoes are nice for those who want the barefoot experience without sacrificing style!  The do look cool.  These kicks kick.All in all, I'm happy with these shoes.  Should my experience with them change in the future, the review will be updated.",

William Sung,A fan of the shoe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGTI3A7K73R10/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7NZHV48,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 12, 2024",Size: 12 WideColor: Wt03 | Navy,,I love me my barefoot shoes and this seems to be a close looker to a similar shoe. Overall the build quality is okay I would not say this is a tank of a shoe and its not meant to be. It is very light and the material does not flex much around the foot. I wish it had more of a stretch as to hold my foot better and give me more feed back. There is a cork insole which was an interesting touch though i am not 100% sure i like the insole of this shoe it does seem to add some comfort but gives an interesting feeling while wearing.  I have only logged about 20k steps in the shoe so far and it seems to be decently comfortable Ill probably need to double it to see if anything really changes. The shoe didnt really need break in but it did help the fabric mold a little to my foot shape as well as the cork but very little chnaged in terms of comfort.,
