The selectable options are actually in UK sizes, the received packaging will have the US sizes printed, and the shoes themselves use European sizes inside so convert the size options from UK size to your chosen size type for best fit. The heel-to-toe is completely incorrect so ignore it.  I ordered the size 8 and 9 to compare sizes because according to the size chart from heel-to-toe I should be a size 8, side note I'm usually a US size 9.5 which I would have ordered instead of the 9 for testing but it wasn't an option, which is why I got different sizes to see what worked. What I received however was sizes 9 and 9.5 according to the packaging but the sizes inside the shoes are in European sizes 42 and 43. The 43 fit perfectly and are very comfortably.  One star demotion for the confusing sizing issue, otherwise great shoe.",

I got some wide Asics for running walking which offered some relief, but soon found I couldn't go back to any of my old shoes without pain. I liked the Asics, but I couldn't wear them everywhere. They're pretty much Dad shoes. 😅  So I bought these hoping to find something slightly more stylish to go out in. My expectations were pretty low at $25, but boy did these over deliver!  I pretty much never leave reviews, but these felt amazing as soon as I put them on. I got mine in a wide and they just felt delicious on my feet. Oh my God, so good. The toe box is perfect.

Rob S.,Come in a wide size!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G4AK5OAT9QTR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3LYMN6N,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 18, 2024",Size: 7.5 WideColor: Light Gray,,"The shoes are sized just about right.  Mine are wide.  They are just a tad short - maybe half a size, but the width is pretty good.  The material is breathable and synthetic.  The soles are not very thick, and you can feel rocks under you, but they are not uncomfortable.  There is enough room in the shoes to use an aftermarket insole, which you will need if you have high arches.These shoes were a little disfigured upon arrival, but after wearing for about two days, the dents fell out.  The first day I wore them, I believe I put about 10 thousands steps in them.  No blisters, but I could feel the front of the shoes hitting my toenails.  There was no pain though.I have since worn them primarily in an office environment, but live in the desert.  These shoes do OK off the beaten path, but are not designed for rough terrain.  I think the looks are meh, but they are not ugly.  Because of the wide width, they kind of look like clown shoes in shape but I have short wide feet.I think they are worth the price but if you order them you might want to go up half a size.  So far they have held up well and still look like new after weeks of wearing them.  There is also no noticeable wear so far.  If you like to walk about barefoot like I do, I believe these shoes will be to your liking.  I have arthritis, and these shoes have not made it worse like other shoes have.  For an office setting, they should be fine, just no hiking!",2

The soft knit mesh fabric uppers are a type of synthetic canvas. They blend well into the lightweight rubber soles, allowing enough room and minimal stress on the top of the toes and feet. These well-made Oxfords are durable and reasonably priced.

Now the bad stuff; the size runs small.  Get a half size larger than you normally wear.  They are far from business casual, they are a fabric type sneaker.  The photo shows laces but what it doesn't show is you must tie the laces.  There doesn't seem to be much support, I feel like I am leaning backwards when wearing them.  Not sure how long they would hold up if you wore them daily.  Fashion Oxfords?  Far from it.More good stuff;  After wearing for a couple of hours the falling backward feeling went away.  Not sure I would wear on a daily basis but they might be nice for travel or to put in a backpack to carry an extra light weight pair of shoes.  The soles grip well, almost too well.  if you tend to not fully pick up your foot or shuffle your feet when you walk, there's a chance they will grip to tight and you might fall.  So don't buy these for your grandpa or grandma if they don't have a proper gait.",2

These have more cushion than your typical barefoot shoe, but they do still afford the zero drop and of course the wide toebox.  They are flexible and the soles have good enough grip that I can use them on my boat deck without worry.  They are attractive and don't have the ""clown shoe"" look nearly as much as other barefoot shoes.  The look is casual and pairs well with jeans or shorts.  The fabric is breathable and a bit stretchy, and seems like it will wash well.  These don't seem like expensive shoes, but they are nicer than the price would indicate.  If you are looking to try barefoot shoes and don't want to break the bank, these are a good option to get your feet wet.  They are comfortable and will allow your toes to splay in the natural position, and the zero drop will help alleviate back problems.  Recommended.",2

When these shoes first arrived they looked like they would be huge on me. I ordered a 10 wide, even though I don’t have wide feet wide is all that the shoe comes in.  They showed up as a size 43, which is closer to 9.5 US, but knowing these were ‘barefoot’ type sneakers I lucked out. 43 is what I wore in FiveFingers, the last barefoot shoes I purchased. I tried them on and found that not only did they fit really well but they were exceedingly comfortable.  The shoes look nice, have padding in the right places without getting in the way of the barefoot aspect. Truth be told I’m not sure how long these will hold up. They don’t seem cheap but they don’t exactly scream quality either.  But for $30, a comfortable pair of casual sneakers that look nice enough to be worn anywhere from around the house to a Sunday brunch with a pair of khakis.  If you’re looking for inexpensive comfortable casual sneakers, and you don’t like the support of regular sneakers and prefer barefoot style, I actually recommend that you check these out.  I almost didn’t buy these, but I’m really glad I did. And a note on sizing, being barefoot style if you’re a half size shoe I’d recommend sizing down.",2
