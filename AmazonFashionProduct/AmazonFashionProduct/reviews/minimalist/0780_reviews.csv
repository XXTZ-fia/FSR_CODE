JENNY GONZALEZ,Could be a good shoe however.....,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSKNZDTAXWSNE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4NMC3CV,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",,,"Like many others, I was excited to try these shoes. However, the sizing is way off. I ordered two pairs to ensure I had the correct size, but both were extremely large—more than an inch too long.  The shoes are very comfortable with plenty of room in the toe, but they are narrow near the instep. One issue I encountered was that while the right shoe seemed fine, the left shoe was not sewn correctly in the front, which made the fit worse. The seams near the sides of the shoe are quite pronounced, and you can feel them immediately when you put the shoes on. I can only imagine how uncomfortable they would feel after wearing them for a few hours.  Additionally, I noticed that on the right shoe, the sole was separating from the shoe, and the glue appeared to be soft.",
A. Lowe,Instant back relief!! Gave comfort to my flat feet with arthritic big toes.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3286OBG2D1218/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4NMC3CV,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Size: 11 Wide Women/10 Wide MenColor: Black Gum,Verified Purchase,"Oh my goodness! My back has been aching for a few days. I admit the Birkenstocks I've been wearing are pretty worn out. As soon as I put these on, my back started relaxing. I can move around now! I'll come back to update after I wear them for work, but it was an immediate relief, and I have very flat feet and arthritis in the ball of my big toes. Any tight shoes aggravates the toes, but these have a wonderfully wide front without looking like clown shoes. I'll probably get the leather pair.",
Amazon Customer,It takes time to get used to barefoot shoes but so worth it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3510QG1VV11RK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4NMC3CV,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Size: 10 Wide Women/8.5 Wide MenColor: Grey,,"This may be a really long review. I purchased these shoes in Sept 2023 after my PT told me they are better overall for building muscle and would help my back/joints. In Dec 2023 I suffered a back injury leaving me with extreme pain, weakness, and bad sciatica pain. I work retail and after work id come home in worse pain when I would wear these so I started rotating and only wearing them a few times a week. I built up to wearing them every single day and my left leg is no longer numb, my sciatica pain is non existent, I don’t have pain outside of normal working 10 hours on my feet pain, and now regular shoes feel weird. I am posting pictures of my absolutely destroyed pair as I am about to order another two pairs. They held up so well and honestly I’ll probably still keep them since the sole is still good they just need new inserts and a thorough washing.  Anyway, if you’re looking to help reduce pain in your legs, back, feet, I would recommend getting a pair and start adjusting to them. It took me about 3 months to really get to a point I could wear them daily and another 2 months and my pain is so much less it’s unreal. I’ll never go back! Plus they are so easy to clean.",

My balance and coordination have improved and I don’t run into things or trip and fall near as often as I did. I’ve worn them daily for almost 6 months and they’re holding up really well.

The lumps, shown in the photo, appear to be knots of thread.  Hopefully the whole shoe won't unravel now.  So far, so good.  As with all 'barefoot' style shoes I have tried, they tend to run short as compared to regular shoes and they bump the end of the toes unless I order the next size larger.

Jessica Kent,I recommend trying them!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36HELSLOXH4H1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4NMC3CV,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2024",Size: 8 Wide Women/7 Wide MenColor: All White,Verified Purchase,"Hello! Jessica from Texas here, I’m a real person leaving this review who took a chance and tried these shoes and I’m here to tell you about them. I always read reviews before I purchase or eat somewhere so here you go, I hope it helps. I have a wide toe box, high arch, the older I get the more problems I have. I have hippy feet that love to be free and naked. I usually wear Brooks Ghost (wide) running shoes and Clark sandals which aren’t perfect but they work. I started having an issue with one of my toes which prompted me to explore other options. I liked the style of these and hoped they would look good with anything from jeans, athletic, dress, shorts, etc. After wearing them I think they do look good with anything. I was worried the front would look too big like clown feet but it’s not bad at all. I wear no show socks with them, that’s my style preference. I do recommend wearing socks with them because there’s a spot on the inside that didn’t feel comfy when I tried them barefoot. Plus barefoot makes your shoes stink anyways. I was worried about my big toe busting out, as it has a history of this! But these have a protective layer on the inside and this is how the shoe exceeded my expectations, I didn’t notice it had it in the pictures online. The white is more of an off white than a bright white. They are very light weight, breathable, and flexible. When I put them on it takes a little adjustment with the tongue to get everything aligned so I wouldn’t say they are easy/quick slip on. After I put them on I went on a walk, immediately I noticed my calves, shin, and ankle area were tired because it must be a new way of walking my body needs to get used to. This went away eventually during the walk as I got used to walking flat footed. The walk went great so I have been wearing them for almost 2 weeks now everyday. I wore them on my trip to South Padre Island, I walked to the end of the long jetty and back, I walked on the beach with them, and walked all around the island. I wear them every day when I walk on the trail which has many different types of terrain. You feel the ground more with these but it doesn’t hurt me so far. I noticed they have a good grip on the ground. The bottoms don’t slip and slide. I can’t say for wet ground though until I experience it. I like them so much I’m ordering more colors. I’m not sure how I’m going to wash these white ones I got, but I think I should be gentle with them. Maybe after I wash them I’ll come back and update how that went.",7

Thicker sole than a real barefoot shoe, but not a bad thing in this case. The shape of the shoe sole is wide and natural (even with my EEE wide feet it stays under the whole foot). The sole is also flat and does not have any arch support or try to lock your foot into a particular position. I've now purchased 4 pairs in multiple colors and they are all wearing pretty well, especially for the price.  If you are new to bare foot shoes, this might be a good starter because of the thicker sole with more cushion.

I looked at all different types of bare feet shoes for months and struggled in purchasing anything. I finally decided on the shoe. I got them today and they are very comfortable. I enjoy that my feet do not feel crunched into a shoe. The sole is nice. Not super chunky, but still, I can feel that there is some ground underneath me which helps because I get off-balance very easily due to a lot of health issues.  So far after taking my shoes out for a spin, I still like them and would possibly buy another pair.  The only thing that I wish they had was a little bit wider around the arch area. I wish the whole shoe was as wide, kind of boxy as the tow area straight back if they had not curved it in for an arch, but that’s not a major thing for me, but it would be nice because my foot is also wide all the way back. It’s kind of like a big square, very hard to find shoes, but this is an excellent choice. The price was reasonable. I have probably three other pairs of shoes that I thought would work and have paid considerably higher amounts and within a week my feet were in so much pain so I am hoping that these shoes  Can help not being able to handle shoes on my feet. I do not go outside very much and have been almost what I would call trapped within my house. I am hoping they give me the freedom to want to get back out and walk and enjoy the world I think these shoes if I had to give them a grade one through 10 I would say they’re about a seven or a B.",5
