Amorton7,Why did I listen?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UWG2ITBSP7TX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLV667HH,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2025",Size: 11 WideColor: W85 Cool Grey,Verified Purchase,"These shoes are fragile. I have worn many barefoot-style shoes in the past, and gave these a chance due to a referral. I should not have listened. They are brittle, narrow in the toe box, and the customer service has been very poor. The pair I ordered was clearly worn. Shoes are glued together with cheap fabric. Spend your money elsewhere and buy a better brand (xero, vivo barefoot, altas, etc).",
Dustin Roach,Love these,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25MQXNUVXG0VP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLV667HH,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",Size: 10 WideColor: W85 Light Grey,Verified Purchase,These shoes are amazing!!  I wear a 10.5 (in Nike) and got the 10. They fit great. If you are looking for a pair of shoes that has no cushion has plenty of room in the toe box and super comfy these are for you. They have a sock like fit at the top which makes the fit awesome.  I got these because of my plantar fasciitis and they have helped.  Plus I can slip them on with no socks.  Definitely gonna get another pair. I highly recommend them.,
Cary,Ask Yourself If You Have Fat Feet Before Ordering,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CG4IDJ5L7QE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLV667HH,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Size: 13 WideColor: W85 Classic Black Gum,Verified Purchase,"My foot measures 11.5 inches exactly, which falls between 12.5 and 13 on the size chart. I sized up, which was the wrong decision. I should have sized down, and not because of the length or width, but because of the generous girth of the shoes. On a normal shoe this isn’t a problem, but this shoe does not have a floating tongue, so when I attempt to snug them up, I have to “fold” the tongue. I would have returned them if I had noticed at the onset, but they are stretching out with every wear, and getting worse. I have wide feet, but not fat feet. I wish I would have known before wearing them out, and not being able to return them.",

I was skeptical because of the brand and price, so I have waited 5 months to write this review.  I am a woman with big, wide feet. Finding shoes is a pain, as not many styles are offered in a Women’s 11W. I often resort to buying men’s shoes in gender-neutral styles.  I always wear a women’s 11W, but for some reason I always need a 10 to 10.5 in men’s shoes. I first ordered these in a 10, but they were too big. I sized down to a 9 and the length is perfect.  My husband has a 9 in the regular width of these shoes. They are slightly too narrow on me. These are slightly too wide, but still wearable.  The shoes are a great material and very stylish. They show minimal wear after 5 months. (I only wear them 1-2 times a week.)  The only con is my big toenail sometimes gets sore wearing these. The same thing happens with Crocs. I think it’s due to the up and down roominess of both kinds of shoes.  Overall, I definitely recommend this particular style.",
Rack,The only shoes that don't hurt my feet!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14GB1EL6CL4PK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLV667HH,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 15, 2024",Size: 11 WideColor: W85 Green Gum,Verified Purchase,"I have very flat wide feet, shoes are always a pain to figure out for myself, plenty of them just leave me sore after hours of use. These shoes however are amazing! I have been able to walk miles in a day with no problem, all completely painless. I have been able to walk more, for longer, than with any other shoe I have worn before.  I have used them so much in my every day to day that I have gone through two pairs in 2 years until I run down the sole from using them too much. I don't take this as a drawback because I ruin the soles of my shoes in every single one of my shoes on the same spot and switching my shoes each year is the recommended sanitary practice so I don't mind, especially when the price of these is very affordable in comparison to other orthopedic clunky shoes.  Super comfortable to wear, I wish they had more style for different occasions, weathers and outfits but overall I am incredibly satisfied and I don't think I'll switch to another pair any time soon.",

Guys I am 315lbs and I was so accustomed to having lots of padding in my shoes because of my spine issues but let me tell you that even though you can feel everything on the floor from these shoes, it gives a support that actually feels really good and helps minimize my pain. I might start off in pain but then the pain goes away versus with sketchers foam shoes I start off with minimal pain or none and end up in pain. They even make me walk more inverted I feel which is what I believe in aligns my spine and that's why I end up in more pain. 5 stars for sure!  These shoes are amazing for walking and I have back problems. Yesterday I went to a museum with other shoes and my back was killing me. I came home and I had to walk my dog and I put these shoes on to test them out and it actually helped minimize my back pay and I was able to walk better. However, today I tested them out again and I have a pain in the back of my right foot because the shoe is digging into it now. I did notice yesterday that this is a wide shoe but somehow my foot is still being squeezed from in front around the ankle area of the tongue of the shoe and I thought I could live with this if I make some slits but the shoe the way that it's made. If you make slits you make slits in the whole shoe because there is no tongue. It's just one material or one piece for the whole shoe plus a second piece that makes for the shoelaces. So if I were to cut slits on the tongue then the whole shoe is compromised. Again, I'm very divided because these shoes feel great on the bottom of my feet walking and even help my posture my back pain. So I will let you know and give you an update on what I decide",4
