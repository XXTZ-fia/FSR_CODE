It's sleek, stylish and functional. It fits perfectly in my front pocket and holds all my cards and cash securely. The leather is soft and durable, and the RFID blocking feature gives me peace of mind. I bought the bifold style in black and it looks great with any outfit. This is one of the best wallets I've ever owned and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality product at a reasonable price.",
ampj_dad,Very functional,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KYSPLKIANO5A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLXPY21C,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2024",,,"This wallet is just a tad bigger than it seemingly has to be to accommodate credit cards. Not glaringly so, just the first impression I had on receipt. It still fits easily into my pockets but it definitely a little larger than my prior wallet.  I’m not referring to the thickness of the wallet; any design with an AirTag pocket is going to be a little thicker. It’s the overall size, length and width, I’m referring to when describing the size.  The credit card slots are all easy to access and the pocket holding the AirTag is a breeze to use. It’s a good wallet for the price.",
Rebecca M,not leather,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TEEX3JW82554/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLXPY21C,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2024",Style: Bifold Wallet With Airtag Holder,,"I'm not a leather expert, but this doesn't look, smell, or feel like leather to me.  I didn't see anything inside it indicating it was leather.  I rechecked the description.  Even though the title lists as leather (first word), the material says ""faux leather.""  So, it makes sense that I thought plastic when I saw this wallet.  I was disappointed.  I was hoping to give this as a gift down the road, but the presentation struck me as something a kid might give to their dad--a cheap plastic wallet.  Maybe I'm being overly critical.  I read the other reviews and nobody, even those who had complaints, seemed to feel this way, but that was my first impression on opening this up.  The outside presentation was pretty nice, though.  I will say that, as others said, the design seemed off.  I expected to be able to open up a bill fold.  The layer seemed to be there, but it was completely closed off, like there was extra bulk for no purpose.  Having a money clip on the inside doesn't make sense either.  It's going to really add thickness to the wallet.  Putting it on the outside would allow some versatility, at least.  You could clip it onto something if not using it for cash and the wallet would seem slimmer overall.  I would not recommend this as something you would buy for yourself and probably wouldn't recommend as a gift either unless you just need something and don't care if they're going to like it or not.",
Ashley S,Slim and compact,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U52M7ZODFWNX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLXPY21C,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2024",,,"This is a perfect little holder for our various gift cards to keep them together and organized without cluttering up my main wallet. It is a nice slim and compact design, makes it fit in any type of bag or space without being bulky or anything. However because of this slim design it can only really hold one card per slot so no doubling up. For me it fit approximately 7 gift cards, which is more than enough to hold at one time. it might be harder to get as many credit cards in there if you have ones with raised digits. Overall though it feels sturdy and works great for our needs.",
Steve,stylish but way too stiff -- impossible to fill every slot,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R391NX1B62B15T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLXPY21C,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2024",Style: Bifold Wallet With Airtag Holder,,"Update: it's been 2 weeks and I *want* to like it more, but this wallet is still pretty stiff, the cards are really hard to extract, and the money clip is impossibly tight. I actually ripped some bills while trying to tuck them into the clip.  UPDATE #2: after 3 months of suffering with this wallet I finally gave up on it. I carried it daily and used it for over 100 days. It never softened even a tiny bit. The money clip continued to need two hands to pry apart. Nobody should have to struggle with their wallet! It's now in the trash and I've downgraded it to 2 stars. I'm not going down to 1 star because I suppose there's a chance that someone really wants an Airtag wallet and they have hardly any cards or bills to store in it, and they really want a super stiff wallet.  Pros: it's a nice design that feels nice in my hand. I really like that nearly all of the slots have a notch or window that facilitates sliding cards out. There are *a lot* of slots, which leads to the cons.  Cons: oh boy, this wallet is tight. I think it's largely due to the nature of the woven leather strips, which, because it's a weave, are thick. Each inner layer is twice as thick as if it were just a thin slice of leather. I filled roughly half of the slots and realized I could go no further. It just becomes impossible to slide anything out due to tightness. Subtracting one star for being way too tight. Notice how none of the manufacturer photos show an actual AirTag in the round hole? Yeah, that's because it's impossible. The hole is too stiff to squeeze an AirTag in there, even when the wallet is totally empty. And if you somehow got an AirTag in there, it would bulge out way too far. It's a totally impractical idea. Subtracting another star for this ridiculous claim. Lastly, the money clip is super strong and tight, nearly unusable.  Observation: as I unloaded my old wallet I noticed that all the inner slots had leather edging but nylon inner (non visible) sleeves. Those nylon slots made way more cards fit in a similarly sized wallet, including a bill fold section.  Good to know: there is no money slot for bills, only a money clip. (Not deducting stars for this because it's advertised this way.)  Also, my photos were taken just before and then immediately after I loaded it up with my cash and cards. It was so tight that I had to remove 7 cards that had previously fit in my old wallet. I photographed those cards and keep their numbers on my phone now, so maybe that was a good thing to force me to declutter?! Two weeks later it did soften up a little bit such that it mostly sits flat when out of my pocket, but the cards are all still so hard to pull out, and the money clip still super tight.",
Angie,Nice and simple,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PJ4ZT3Q1UNI4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLXPY21C,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 3, 2024",,,My husband loved this! He usually despises carrying a wallet but he actually uses this for his license and debit card.,
Julee M,Nice quality and trendy pop up wallet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7ZUZU5Z8DVCC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLXPY21C,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2023",,,My teenage son loved this wallet and found it perfect for his needs. The pop up feature works great and can definitely fit around 5-6 cards comfortably. The slots on the outside of the wallet are a little snug but will probably expand after they are used. The air tag feature is great and the overall look of this wallet is very cool. It would be nice for everyday use or swap it out when you want something slim and want to limit what you are carrying for the day/night. Came nicely packaged and would make an excellent gift.,
joel,A little tight,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IIRO9XJE485X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLXPY21C,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 25, 2023",,,"Great slim wallet, but the cards slots on the leather is a little tight and might need to be worn in before it is easy to access the cards. The flip up options for cards are great and works like a charm. If you do not carry cash or coins this is a great wallet but if you use cash and coins there are no slots or pockets for it. The air tag seems a little gimmicky, and ruined the slim feature of this wallet, so I cut out off and like it much better this way. The letter is if great quality, looks like they had a carbon fiber option too.",
Bree B.,Stylish but Slightly Bulky - Leather Bifold Men's Slim Wallet with Money Clip,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21IA0D4NLFD81/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLXPY21C,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 22, 2023",,,"Title: Stylish but Slightly Bulky - Leather Bifold Men's Slim Wallet with Money Clip  Rating: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)  I recently purchased the Leather Bifold Men's Slim Wallet with Money Clip, drawn to its sleek design and promise of functionality. Upon initial inspection, the wallet exuded a classy aesthetic with its genuine leather and neat stitching. However, my experience with it has been a mix of satisfaction and slight disappointment.  The wallet's dimensions, at 3.3 x 4.6 x 0.7 inches, are reasonable for a bifold design. It fits comfortably in pockets without creating an unsightly bulge. The material feels durable, hinting at long-lasting quality. The inclusion of a money clip is a thoughtful touch, providing a secure option for cash storage.  The wallet boasts about 9 card pockets, and here lies both a strength and a weakness. While the ample card slots allow for organized storage, I found it unwise to fill every slot, especially on the side where the money clip is located. The money clip, although practical, makes removing cards from adjacent slots challenging. This can be inconvenient when you need quick access to a specific card, resulting in a minor usability flaw.  Despite being marketed as a ""slim"" wallet, it falls short in comparison to other non-bifold slim wallets. The added bulk from the bifold design, coupled with the money clip, makes it less slim and more cumbersome than expected. If a truly minimalist design is a priority, there are slimmer alternatives available.  On the positive side, the wallet's construction seems sturdy, and the stitching is well-executed. It appears capable of withstanding the rigors of everyday use. The leather exudes a sophisticated appeal that complements a professional or casual style.",
