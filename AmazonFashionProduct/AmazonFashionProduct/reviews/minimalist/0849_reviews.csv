The top is a little tight on my foot but I was able to overlook that for the reasonable price and great width of the shoe. After a week or so, I realized the insole still has a bit of uneven padding so I removed it to create what I hoped would be a true barefoot experience. Unfortunately the sole of these shoes has many treads that can be felt on the foot when walking for longer distances. I used them on the treadmill, walking only, last week and got blisters on the bottom of my feet where the ball of the foot was consistently pressing on one of the lumps of the treads. If the soles were flat this would not be an issue, or if the insole has been flat and not needed to be removed, perhaps it would have absorbed some of the unevenness of the sole, but as it’s currently designed, this is not a true barefoot shoe.",
