Donna Riley,Poor quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RT3BKOJLUL13R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07GKDCZMT,"1.0 "," the United States "," May 9, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"I loved the logo on the tee shirt, that is why I purchased it. After I washed in cold, and did not put it in the dryer, When I went to wear it again, it had started to unravel at the neck, not just a small ravel, but the kind if you pull it or cut it, the whole thing ravels out. Waste of my money, disappointed because I did like the looks of the shirt. I can now use it as a paint shirt. Buyer beware.",

Amazon Customer,"Cute style, the print is not very bright.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LJ59P0HA8JGP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07GKDCZMT,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 4, 2019",,Verified Purchase,"This T-shirt is cuter than I expected. The material is soft and thick enough (not see-through). The shirt is hip length (I’m 5,4 feet tall); is not tight and is not loose either. I usually wear XS, I ordered S and it fits just right. I gave 4 stars because the black color looks slightly washed off but maybe it’s the way this shirt is supposed to be. The tiny print is not very bright and I have a feeling that it will disappear after a number of washes.",
