jayares,Wanted to love them - but can't,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Z5VTW04B3PP4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC9Q8G16,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Size: 6 Wide Women/5 Wide MenColor: Dark Blue,,"I liked the look of these shoes and the ""hands-free"" feature was a plus. The shoes arrived with non-fixable dents in toes of both shoes, despite being delivered in a shoebox. They also were not ""hands-free"" since the tongue slides halfway down when putting them on. Decided to try again and ordered a replacement pair - which came with dents in the toes of both shoes. Again. Both times I selected the product support link on Amazon which goes directly to Hobibear. After several email communications back and forth over several days - send pictures, suggested fix to push the dents out with my fingers (duh, I already tried but that didn't work) - the final response was Hobibear doesn't handle after-sale support for Amazon. Then why does the link on Amazon go to Hobibear? I'm disgusted with the whole transaction, from the poor quality defective shoes - x2 - to the lack of real customer support - x2. I'm not willing to try a 3rd time, only to get defective shoes yet again.",
Tiffany,Lightweight but run small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFAWBZBIHY0R0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC9Q8G16,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 23, 2024",Size: 8 Wide Women/7 Wide MenColor: All Black,,"These HOBIBEAR Barefoot Sneakers are lightweight and truly do feel close to being barefoot. They seem to be good quality for being simple canvas shoes, and i do like the side toe box. Unfortunately they seem to run a bit small, and the lack of half sizes makes it harder to get an appropriate fit. I normally wear a size 8.5 in shoes, but usually fit into size 8 when half sizes aren't offered. With these shoes the size 8 is just a bit too small and my toes go all the way to the ends. Aside from the sizing issue the shoes are breathable and I like that the style is neutral so they can be worn with most outfits.",
Amazon Customer,Run large and have arch support which I don’t like.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11STC0AEBGXR2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC9Q8G16,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 20, 2024",Size: 7 Wide Women/6 Wide MenColor: Dark Blue,Verified Purchase,"Love Xero shoes but the style isn’t always what I’m looking for. So I tried Hobibear because a friend had these and I thought that they looked great. However, they run big. And I can’t stand anything pushing in the arch of my foot, ergo I love barefoot shoes. But, walking around the house in these, I kept wondering what was irritating me. Discovered that they had some arch support. Now, I can’t stand arch support. But, others might not be as sensitive to that as I am or others may like that. I also don’t like memory foam. Again, others might. I think that this could be a good transition shoe for people who have never worn zero drop shoes. Sadly, They aren’t for me. The cost is great!",

I had read another review that mentioned how the tongue bunches up when you step into them so I was prepared.  But I have been recently doing a lot of barefoot shoe shopping and most are double or triple the price of these AND some are very clownish in appearance.  These are super cute and normal looking.  The toe box is nice and wide yet looks like like a regular pair of sneakers.  I decided I could easily fix the issue of the tongue bunching up by sewing thr tongue to the shoe with elastic thread..  Turned out to be much harder to push the needle through than I imagined, but with a bit of struggle I got it done.  In the photo the left shoe has been sewn and the right one not yet sewn (you can see how the tongue is bunches up when I first stepped in).  Truly these feel fabulous and the price is certainly fabulous !!  AND I found them to be true to size.",2

The fit is great and they are very basic. He’s not crazy about the slip on part, but that’s because he is very active. Even still he’s never had them just fall off when he’s doing his activities. The main thing he doesn’t like is he walked through dew covered grass one day and they completely discolored the toe of the shoe. They now have an interesting water line almost that he can’t get to go away. They are very lightweight and comfortable though.",

These are a good concept but I couldn't wear them. For some reason when I walked in them my foot slipped right out of the heel so was clomping around the room.  Had to return them which was too bad because I loved the color and style.,
C Morris,"Definitely not totally hands-free (because of the tongue), but they are faster & easier to put on",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BW0BM39685D9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC9Q8G16,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 19, 2024",Size: 9 Wide Women/8 Wide MenColor: All Black,,"I really like these. I wish they were truly hands-free, as I'm pregnant & have a bad back, so it's difficult to bend. They're not hands-free, because if you put them on like that, the tongue gets squished up & they you have to reach to fix it anyway - it's easier to hold the shoe while you put it on. But, because of the back & not needing to tie them, they are DEFINITELY still much easier to put on than regular sneakers would be, so I'm still pretty happy with them. The quality is also pretty good. So, I really can't complain much, they're pretty nice, comfortable, & make my life easier - especially when I'm in a hurry - but I can't wear flip-flops because I have to wear compression socks, so having sneakers I can put on really quickly is so helpful.",
Amazon Customer,most comfortable shoes!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S31GV6QKALRI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC9Q8G16,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 17, 2024",Size: 9 Wide Women/8 Wide MenColor: White,Verified Purchase,this is my second pair of Hobibear shoes.

He's also been wanting some barefoot shoes for a while now. He says they're extremely comfortable and loves the fact that you can just slide your feet into them. He says the wide toe box is perfect for him and his wide feet and allows the shoe to be comfortable for long periods of time. Sometimes you don't even notice you're wearing them. The construction of the shoe itself appears to be of high quality and should hopefully last a long time.,
Reen Kennedy,Great and comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2E4ZP6YIT7RDT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC9Q8G16,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2024",Size: 9 Wide Women/8 Wide MenColor: All Black,,"UPDATE!!! I have been wearing these more and as long as I wear my nice thick-ish socks and pull the toggles to tighten things up these actually fit really well with no slip. And I do like that my toes have space to wiggle in the wider toe box. So I think I did get the right size after all.  My one complaint is that since this isn't a shoe that's meant to be tied if you actually have to tighten the laces you end up with floppy laces --so I have to tuck those into the lower lace parts of my shoe. But when I do tighten them they stay pretty snug for awhile. :: So I do tend to slip these on more frequently now and love the comfort of them.  Sticking with 4 stars because you may get annoyed with having to tuck the laces in rather than being able to tie them.  ___ORIGINAL REVIEW___ My typical shoe size is 8.5 (EU39). I got a different Hobibear style of shoe in a 7 Women's and it was too small; based on the suggested sizing (at the time I got this) it was suggested I get a 9 Women's. I did and that is too big.  An 8 Women's in this shoe would be perfect -- I typically don't like to ""size down"" and opt for sizing up, but in this case that ended up making the shoes just too big to fit me well enough to wear regularly. I do have to tighten the ""laces"" to be able to wear these without feeling them slip.  These could be 5 stars but I'm not able to wear them enough to tell. I do like the wide toe box -- it looks stylish and not clownish. I wish I had got the right size for my feet because I think I'd live in these because they are comfy and have a nice width.",

I took a 2 mile walk without socks and they did not rub, blister or bother my feet at all.  They are easy to slip your heel in... but as you can see in my video, you will still have to bend down to pull the tongue out of the shoe.  This kinda defeats the purpose of having slip on shoes.I like that they have a wide toe-box and leave plenty of room for my tootsies.  These are my new walking shoes and are great for general every day wear.",3
aschae,My new favorite barefoot sneakers!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O0C87SCG0ASA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC9Q8G16,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 12, 2024",Size: 9 Wide Women/8 Wide MenColor: Black,,"Loving these wide-box barefoot unisex sneakers. My favorite thing about them is that they have this nice square toe which keeps them from looking overly large which always happens to me since I wear a ladies' size 9. With feet that are already big for a woman to begin with, I like the compact look that the square toe gives them. They are also super comfy, and are sized very well - the size 9 fit perfect without being at all tight, yet not too loose that they feel like they will fall off. They are also slip-in shoes, which I absolutely love as I hate taking the time to have to tie my shoes so the fact that I can slip right into these is super useful. I also love the loose laces that don't need to be tied and they have a nice capped end to keep them from fraying. They are a fabric shoe so they are cool and breathable with a nice rubber sole to keep you from sliding. I'm a huge fan of zero-drop wide box shoes and, so far, after owning a few pairs now, these are surely my favorite! Incredibly happy with them!",2
Azriel-Goddess,Great 🎉 👟 shoes!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31S3LRSOSZPEB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC9Q8G16,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 11, 2024",Size: 12.5 Wide Women/11.5 Wide MenColor: All Black,,"I must say that I'm quite impressed by how these actually turned out when they showed up at my door 🚪! Sometimes when you buy things online they say one thing and they show up to be a whole other story as you obviously may know by now from ordering online but these shoes are absolutely wonderful! I have a lot of foot issues in between I needed something that could be large and stabilize enough with the widening of the toes so I don't have to deal with more foot discomfort and these are stylish, comfortable, wide enough in the toe area and a good starting is as well where it's not triggering my plantar fasciitis! I'm actually quite surprised and these are now my other new pair of favorite shoes, they're made really well and the breathability of them have my toes feeling good where I don't feel like they're sweating at all if I wear them for a few hours at a time with my socks. Thank you! ✨",2
