Worn roughly 4-6 days a week in that time period while at the gym. Shoes were great but I would not recommend for running. Not enough padding as I ran with my son for a fun raiser. The comfort was great seemed durably but the final straw to have to retire these were the outside rubber piece broke (the part that holds the laces) not sure from over use or what. I would buy these again but want something with a bit more absorbing power for when I run.,

I wear them without any insole, and I can feel everything. They won't protect you entirely from pointy rocks, but they protect just enough for what I want. I've worn the soles pretty flat and thin at this point, so it's about time for a new pair, but they haven't come apart anywhere.  That said, I wouldn't describe them as trail anything. They don't have enough knob to inspire any confidence on loose or steep surfaces. Great for everyday or being on very mild trails, I guess, but not gonna put you at ease running on anything loose.",

Thisguy188,"Great for back, but beware goat heads and shin pain",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HRLEZ8CILWA5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3ZRW4D6,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 7, 2024",Size: 13.5Color: W63 All Black,Verified Purchase,"If you're getting a zero drop sole shoe, then these are great. The fabric is a bit elastic which helps make the shoes feel comfortable immediately out of the box. I paired them with some elastic shoe laces and they make a great slip on. They are quiet, fit right but offer no arch support. Simple warnings if you have never had barefoot shoes, the lack of cushion is, at first, very hard on your shins. You will go around a month with shin pain as your body adapts to the change. The pain is never unbearable, but it's a bone pain which is definitely unpleasant. Due to this, don't give up. The temporary shin pain is worth the eventually lack of back pain and strain. While not a perfect solution to lower back pains, the benefits of barefoot shoes and zero drop soles are very real ib my experience and have relieved years of back pain. The next part, specific to this shoe is that the sole is thin. This is intentional but something you may not realize is that it is just thin enough for longer goat heads to penetrate the sole and prick your foot. This came as a shock to me the first time I got soles these thin. If you live in an area where goat heads grow then you may want to look into some sort of sole insert that is puncture resistant. Many are sold for construction workers for protection and they are around $15-35. You are easily able to remove the included insole and replace it and I'd recommend it if you may find yourself walking in goat heads or other such spikes. While you may debate whether or not you should try barefoot shoes and zero drop soles, if you find yourself wanting to try them out then I'd recommend these ones. Good for work, good for walking and worth the money.",3

I have been using the same pair of shoes for almost every day use for 2+ years straight. So here is what I will summarize to keep the journey concise:  The Cons: - The insole fell out and wore out within the first 6 months if I remember correctly. Eventually I just pulled it out and went on like that. - The tread on the shoes also wore out very quickly, with most of it gone also within the first year or 6 months. I used these shoes for playing soccer, and also going to work everyday where I stood on a concrete smooth ground. - The tread now is like paper thin and I am honestly surprised I don't have any holes officially showing. - Don't step in any puddles with these shoes, they get wet easily! Good thing is they can also dry kind of fast, but overall not comfortable getting wet with.  Pros: - Its a barefoot shoe so expect a barefoot experience (which I am a fan of now because I have wide flat feet) - These shoes are SUPER comfortable when you first put them on and have great traction! - I love the elastic all around that feels like a nice hug on my feet all the time without limiting my movement in anyway. - No pinching ever noticed with these shoes they are great for parkour too if you are into that.  Overall: I think its worth the price considering how I abused these shoes for 2 years. However I would love to see some durability improvements to really make this good to recommend to friends. They need a better sole compound overall that will help it last longer.  Hope this helps.",

The sole is thinner than you're typical shoe, they’re great for everyday walking on level surfaces.

On occasion it can be a little pokey. They are SUPER slippery on wet rocks or tile, in the grocery store even.  Now for some reason the color of the rubber on the bottom this time is almost pink instead of tan. (I have the black and “gum” color) They are definitely much less sleek with that pinkish tint  In my pictures you can see my first shoe (granted, worn and dirty) is more tan (especially on the side where it’s more original color) rather than the new shoes which are reddish pink?  The wide toe box is basically non existent on the new pair. It really rubbed on my pinky toe. There should not be a period of “breaking them in” with wide toe box shoes— so I’m sending them back. In my picture you can see my old shoe on the right is much wider. Thats how they should be. Overall— disappointing because they were shoes I would have bought over and over again until the design changes.",

The thin, flexible, zero-drop soles provide the best stability and grip I’ve found in any shoe I’ve tried. The mesh uppers are super flexible and lightweight and air/dry out quickly. It’s as close to being barefoot as you can get while also getting the protection and grip needed to reduce your risk of injury. As I’m often between sizes (11.5-12 US), I went a size down on these (11), and they fit great. I’ve worn them minimum 2-3 x a week for about 6 months, and they still look practically brand new. When they do wear out, I definitely plan to replace them with a new pair just like them.",
