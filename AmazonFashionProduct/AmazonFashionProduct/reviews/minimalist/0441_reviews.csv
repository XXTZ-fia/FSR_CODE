First off, for those mentioning lack of insole padding you're missing the point.  You're supposed to feel every stick and rock while walking, if you can't handle that these shoes aren't for you.I carry about 25 extra pounds on my 6'1"" frame and as I've aged my knees and feet feel it.  After wearing these shoes for a while I have much less pain in my knees.  Honestly I thought the hype was a bunch of BS but took a chance to find out for myself.  I walk our dogs daily on wooded dirt trails, the terrain is fairly rugged and it took some getting used to in these Whitin shoes.  I now feel no pain climbing stairs, where in the past it was a bit difficult.These shoes may not be a life changer for everyone but for me I'm a believer.  Now that winter is approaching here I'm shopping for a warmer pair.  I've put a lot of walking miles (not jogging, can't speak to that) on these and they are holding up exceptionally well.  The ""not very expensive"" gamble paid off for me.",

Great for lifting because they are minimalist and flat. Perfect for squat, deadlift, etc. where you need a flat shoe surface and don't want a cushiony shoe. I also use for light running (less than mile) and sprinting and work great.  Not a lot of arch support or cushion but it's not what i was after.  I have averaged 3 times a week for one hour of cross training. These shoes worked great for 4 to 6 months.  Even with wide feet, the toe box couldn't get or stay tight as the ties are further up the shoe, and i had them eventually all the way tight. They lasted about 6 or so months before the shoes were too loose to wear for general gym use. They would fall off during prowler (sled) pushes, etc.  The tread is extremely durable and after 10 months in nearly new condition.  Overall good value if you don't mind the stretch and having to get new shoes in 6 to 12 months.",

I track all of my walks and hikes, and in the time I've had these shoes, I've covered approximately 880 miles (about 1,820,700 steps). That said, while the shoes have been fantastic for foot health, they haven't held up as well as I’d hoped. After logging so many miles, there are now large holes in the toes, which is disappointing given their performance otherwise.

Great value Couldn’t resist a second pair to keep clean.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2B43A07K3IJ9M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4F33NRM,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 11, 2024",Size: 11Color: W20 Dark Grey,Verified Purchase,"You can truly feel the breeze through these shoes with average to thin socks. I love it. My feet are always hot and sweaty. Which Segways into my only minor issue with the shoes. And to their credit, I believe my sweaty feet wear out MOST insoles more rapidly than other folks feet. lol!  Also I think the insoles are designed to let you feel the ground after they’re “broken-in”, which is what I want. And they are available for replacement for like $2.99, so I’m not complaining. Just informing.  The rest of this long review is all positive. The insoles are my only small con, see the last photo. They halfway wore out in 3 months of extremely heavy use. So maybe it’s almost a feature and not a flaw. You want to feel the ground? Keep your insoles. Don’t mind feeling it or not? Buy replacements. I’ll keep mine till they fall apart.  These shoes have acted as my one and only pair of shoes. I mean no other shoes used at all except slides occasionally for convenience. Any time I actually want to move around or walk/run efficiently, these shoes and only these are worn. I can stop on a dime/turn on a dime oh so comfortably. I’ve been working and exercising both indoors/outdoors alike, and enjoying leisure, day in and day out in these shoes.  This is my second pair! I wish the grey was darker but who cares. They are THAT good. The other ones are still great. I’ve just dedicated them to the work at the construction site and the outdoors. Because they are SO MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE than work boots(obviously).  I love sneaking around(OSHA) in them on the job site. Another worker was walking by and my feet were at his eye-level. In passing, he poked my big toe and laughed! Lmbo. You’re technically supposed to wear puncture resistant, steel toed boots. But I’ve been doing end stage HVAC construction so it’s easy to stay safe. Just watch out for occasional nails and metal shards. I bet I’m more comfortable in my actual physical shoes than anyone else there!  I wouldn't even call this a gripe, because I’m keeping them. But the “dark grey” color is not dark. I’m tempted to return them and get black with gum sole, but I don’t like gum soles so I think I’ll keep them. They look great. Love the black strings and blue accent design on the sides. Such a great pair of shoes for the price. Even if they did cost more from what I can tell, they’d be worth it. Perhaps I’ll review again or update how long they last.  [Amazon prompted to review the “slipperiness”] They aren’t slippery at all to me! A 26 year old, average weight male. I went from Addidas with a sole smooth as butter! I would slip as soon as there was enough rain to coat the bottom of my shoes. So immediately after it started raining. These have phenomenal grip. I use them for every day use rain or shine. They have also performed wonderfully on my trail hikes here and there as well! I love feeling the rocks, and tree roots beneath my feet. You’ll even feel the subtle crunch of leaves and pine straw beneath your feet.  They fit great too. No surprise. I have worn US size 11 in men’s for all my tennis shoes since I was a teen. I didn’t check a conversion chart or anything. Just ordered 11s and they fit exactly as I would hope. Couldn’t be happier.",8

Only time will tell if they are as durable.,
Harris Homeschoolers,Amazingly comfortable. Surprisingly durable.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18QYMMDC6CCFO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4F33NRM,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 23, 2024",Size: 11Color: W20 Green,Verified Purchase,"I have had these for over 1 year and have really put them to the test to see how durable they really are. I purchased them to play disc golf in the hot summer months of Texas where it gets over 100 on a regular basis with 80% humidity. If you don't play disc golf please let me explain something to you. Disc golf footwear gets worn out fast. You plant your feet and then pivot on concrete, dirt, rocks, and other terrain. In addition, you will get your feet wet either playing in the early morning on the wet grass, or getting caught in the rain, or going to retrieve a shot in the water hazard. These things have seen it all. I have even used them to mow the yard with a manual push lawn mower without any problems. Based on my discgolf app (Udisc) I have walked/hiked approximately 60 miles in them and they're still going strong.",
Dickie Duhaime,Absolute Comfort,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMYABM90EY27I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4F33NRM,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 23, 2024",Size: 12.5Color: W20 Dark Grey,Verified Purchase,"Ordered two other brands before I got what was described.  Unbelievably comfortable and lightweight... Will field test by walking to the mall to return the other two that were miserable failures to what they were described to be.  I wear a size 12, but had to order 12 1/2 to get proper fit.  Very satisfied with these!!!",
bbrogden,Priced at half its closest competitor,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2H75XGLD5V6JT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4F33NRM,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 22, 2024",Size: 11Color: W20 Dark Grey,,I have been trying to distance myself from the Merrell brand due to fitment issues. However it was hard to commit to another brand seeing that the entry price point is usually well over the 100 dollar mark. These shoes feel very familiar to my feet. I didn't have a long break in period or any issues with fitment. These run true to the size guild.  Now to the real test of the shoes Grip on dry creek rock - ✓ Grip on wet creek rock- ✓ Grip on wet creek rock- ✓ With moss. Grip on wet creek rock with- X thin layer of silt  Overall dry time from missing the last test Approx. 1 hr  Not bad for 40 bucks,
