The colors are perfect for our living room theme, and the size is exactly the length of the sliding door. One of the reasons I went with this brand is that they ROLL the rugs for shipping, not fold. So glad someone in shipping understands rugs enough to actually roll them - thank you so very much! I saw the reviews and pictures of folded rugs… OUCH. Also, I did get corner stickers, but didn’t use them after all. I rolled mine in the opposite direction (outside-in) and taped it tightly for just a couple of hours - the corners now are sufficiently flat, and I know to leave “good enough” alone. It probably would slip and require a non-skid pad underneath if I didn’t have 3 heavy plants stands on it, which, thanks to low-ish pile, are very stable. Our kittens also approve of the plushness and are “asking” for a bigger one for the living room. Love it and highly recommend it!",8
