He used to alternate between flip-flops and Hey Dudes, but now these are the only things he slips on other than work boots. He says that they run true to size and are very comfortable. He mentioned that there was no buffer time to wait for them to be broken in as they were the perfect fit and comfort level right away. They clean very easily and are very durable. He's been wearing them every single day",

I have to actually put my hand in and maneuver the insole in place, stuff it down in there to get it all the way to the front of the shoe which is a big hassel. Other than that they're fine.",
Mark Toney,Extremely comfortable and very wide,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P8D4OSDA851E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC639PXS,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 23, 2024",Size: 11.5 Wide Women/10 Wide MenColor: All Black,,These shoes fit perfectly. Excellent value for what you're getting. The traction is beyond what I thought it would be. I haven't slipped at all nor have I been caught up on any kind of flooring or carpeting. They are very comfortable and they feel like they're going to be super durable. They are very lightweight and comfortable right out of the box. The toe box is plenty wide that way I don't have to worry about the size of my feet rubbing and being coming irritated. Overall these shoes are absolutely perfect. They breathe well and are going to last for a very long time with proper care.,

If I am wearing Barefoot shoes or sneakers, I want to be able to wiggle my toes and feel like I am walking barefoot without the pain from stepping on rocks, glass, and other debris.  I had high hopes for the BUHCFBO Men's Slip on Wide Minimalist Barefoot Sneakers but they let me down in 2 areas.  First they are not offered in 1/2 sizes. I wear a Men's 10.5 (US). I could only order 10 or 11 from BUHCFBO so I tried the 10. Unfortunately my toes touch the front of the toe box.  Next, I don't have that barefoot feeling when wearing these sneakers. Are my expectations too high? They are OK as slip-on's for walking the dog in warm weather but I would not wear them for running or for a gym workout. I need support at the gym and don't want my toes to be cramped when running.  I'm giving them 3 stars because they are just OK and not something I would order again.",

There is no slippage whatsoever. The shoes are very comfortable and support my feet well.  I would say they are perfectly balanced.  There is plenty of room for my toes to separate.  The shoes feel very light but also are very durable.  Overall, I highly recommend these shoes.  They do not disappoint!",

I didn’t see him for hours but when I did, he looked like he had been wearing them forever. Not like they looked old and worn, but just comfortable like shoes he had had for a while and just fit his feet like comfy slippers do.  These aren’t his first wide toe box shoes. I’ve ordered him a few pairs because he has wide feet and as he says, whose feet are pointy like lots of shoes. These actually seem shaped the way feet are. I have a pair like these too and I don’t have wide feet but it is nice to have your feet feel free inside of shoes.  With this pair of BUHCFBO Men's Barefoot Shoes, I particularly like the colorof the sole with the black fabric of the shoe. I think they look pretty sharp.  The price for these, around $35, is very reasonable. They probably aren’t the most durable shoes, but will be comfortable while they last.",

It's very hard for me to find shoes that are wide enough and with a big enough toe box. These hit the sweet spot.  I also like that I can't pin them down as to what kind of shoe it is. It's not quite a slipper, but not a sneaker or dress shoe. It's just another shoe - that I'm happy to wear - in my collection that's growing at an alarming rate.  They are just a tiny bit snug on my upper feet, but that's probably because I don't get out much. The size seems to be accurate and the design is very sensible.  At about ~$30, these are a great buy, no matter how long they last.",

These slip-on shoes have a very basic sneaker look and you can get them in three colors.  The shoes come in a ""wide"" size which is perfect for my husband.  The only problem he has with them is that the back top of the shoe is very flimsy, and he has trouble slipping it on without it bending under his heel.  A long-stemmed shoehorn should alleviate this problem.  That being said, I think these shoes are okay but could be priced more competitively.",

I live in an area where mud and dirt incessantly get brought into the house, so shoe removal at the door is the house rule. I've kept slippers by the door in the past, but I have never been pleased with the ill fit.  I was hoping these would work as a replacement for slippers, and they do. The fit is exceptional (size 10 fits exactly as expected), and the comfort level is good. They keep my feet warm, but the shoe is still breathable. They slide on and off easily, making the 'shoe trade' at the front door quick. The soles grip exceptionally well. These are perfect for my needs.  They look decent, and I would certainly wear them outside - but in my case, they will stay a house shoe. I will probably order a second pair for hiking etc.  The negatives:  These are definitely not name-brand styles or quality. Time will tell how well they hold up, but I expect acceptable longevity.  The price is a bit high. I can get a similar Izod shoe at Costco for less.  And then the 'brand'. I'm not sure BUHCFBO is a real word. I certainly don't know how to pronounce it.

This makes wearing socks uncomfortable and they're tight around your ankle which makes wearing them for long periods also uncomfortable.  These shoes also have the look and feel of water shoes. They do not feel like sneakers.  At this price point ( $36.89 as of 10/2024 ) I would not recommend.  We'll be donating them.",
