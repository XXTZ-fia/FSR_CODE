MaryBeth Kirby,Accomodates my Arizona ankle brace,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11H8YVA9F38JB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DR6V6SNG,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2024",Size: 13.5 WideColor: A-black,Verified Purchase,"I needed a larger shoe that I could open wide enough to fit my Arizona ankle brace without fighting to get it in. The brace is thick leather and covers 3/4 of my foot plus makes the ankle extra wide and I was struggling with other shoes to open wide enough. And then lace up tight for extra support. This shoe is 99 percent perfect. My only minor issue is that I personally need to swap out the shoelaces for non soft cotton laces for a pair that slide more easily for me when I pull them tight. Otherwise these are really great shoes, especially if you need a very flat bottom / zero heel height or need a shoe to accommodate your orthodics. The standard inserts have decent padding and are also easily removed  if you need the extra space. Plus the price is great. I 💯% recommend these shoes 👟👟. Be sure to measure your feet to get the correct size - I got it on try number 3 because I did not measure. The extra pairs went to our local homeless shelter for Christmas vs returning them. I'm sure returning would have been fine but I chose to donate because Christmas 🎄🎁",

I’ve tried many different kinds of shoes (including expensive walking shoes), and a variety of insoles and orthotics with limited relief. After realizing that my flip flops gave me the most relief, I decided to try minimalist shoes. The first pair (not these) were good but the sole was a little too thin and I couldn't wear them for any length of time on hard surfaces. So I tried several different brands from Amazon and these are by far the most comfortable. They are the only shoes I can wear all day and not have foot pain! They have a nice insole with a little arch support but still have the flexibility and wide toe box that allows my feet to move and expand freely. The soles are grippy but I haven’t tried them on a wet, slick floor. They look great and the quality of construction seems like they should last a reasonable amount of time given that the price is so reasonable. These have changed my life and I will be ordering more.",
