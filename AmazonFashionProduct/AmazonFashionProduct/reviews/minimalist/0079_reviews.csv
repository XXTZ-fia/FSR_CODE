They offer a slight amount of support without offering too much. I was pretty sore initially in my legs from using these which I take as a good sign. They are extremely comfortable. The shoes seem durable enough, but time will tell. The toe box is enormous and if you have wide feet these will be great. I anticipate with a little training I’ll enjoy wearing these all the time for walking.",

The shoes looked smashed.  After contacting the company through Amazon, they immediately sent me a new pair with the understanding that they won't charge me for the 2nd pair as long as I get the first ones returned to them by the deadline they gave me which was a nice deadline, instead of a very short window of time.  The second pair came in a tight plastic sack on the shoes and an outer plastic mailing pkg. They looked smashed also.  I showed them both to my son in law for his birthday for him to choose if either pair was acceptable for him to wear.  He said these kind of minimalist shoes were supposed to be this way to conform easy with your feet so I gave him both and he was happy!  He has worn these same type of shoes for several years and will probably want these same ones next year too.  SO, the SHOES WERE GREAT, EVEN FOR HIS SERIOUS FEET ISSUES!  PLUS the company's CUSTOMER SERVICE was immediate and EXCELLENT to work with!  Since I can't find a way to go ahead and pay them now for the 2nd pair of shoes instead of waiting until I am past due in paying for them since I am keeping both pairs, I am hoping AMAZON/THE WHITEN COMPANY will see this and go ahead and charge me now (& let me know they did) since we are definitely keeping both pairs!!  Thank you so much for your wonderful and kind help!",
Amazon Customer,Chiropractor Approved,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FU0EL1H46118/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B56TKP6N,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 15, 2024",Size: 9.5 WideColor: W87 | Light Grey,Verified Purchase,"I am a Doctor of Chiropractic, so I'm very particular with how my shoes compliment the biomechanics of the human foot.  The only casual shoes that I wear now are Whitin.  I can wear these shoes comfortably with or without socks.  They look super cool, and they are very affordable.  I have found that they hold up well.  I bought this model, plus another model.  I have had them for at least 6 months and I am very satisfied.What I love about Whitin shoes are the fact that they are built to allow the human foot to simply do what it was designed to do.  This is accomplished in these shoes by having no incline in the heel (zero drop) so the posterior chain of your leg (calf and hamstrings) are not flexed and shortened, and by having a wide toe box so that your toes can spread out as far as they need to.  A zero drop and a wide toe box allow for the proper motion of the 26 bones within the foot.  When the foot moves properly, it absorbs shock.  If the foot doesn't move properly, such as when you are wearing bad shoes (please note:  99% of shoes are made with an incline in the heel and a narrow toe box, and are therefore classified as bad in this doctors opinion), shock will not get absorbed by the foot as well and will get absorbed by your knees, hips, and spine, especially the low back.  Whitin shoes are also great because they are minimalist and have a thin sole.  This allows for greater proprioception between the brain and the feet (proprioception is the brains ability to sense where body parts are in space).  In essence, when you buy shoes, you want them to mimic walking barefoot.  Whitin allows for your feet to do this.  I recommend these shoes to patients on a weekly basis.If you are a human and you have feet, find yourself some high-quality zero drop, wide toe box shoes like Whitins!",5

Very flexible toe, breathable canvas keeps feet comfy, kind of slippery on the soles so light use indoors or light outdoor use. Comfortable for basic weight room exercise…heavy aerobic training, long distance running workout? Style is ok, white sole probably a little nicer appearance for folks who like a one color show.",

They really do put your feet a bit closer to the ground and your toes have a lot of breathing room which is a welcome change from your typical shoe. The lack of arch support and low cushion could cause issues if you have foot pain, it took me a few weeks to really adjust.  Another thing is the durability, I'm not sure how good the soles actually are. I'm about 240lbs so I tend to wear my shoes down quickly and these are no different. So I'd say they have average durability. I've had 1 pair for 2 months and I can already see some wear in the rubber sole at the mid foot and heel. I bought a second pair since I like them so much. Another thing to note is the heel area feels somewhat narrow when you first put them on, but they quickly compress and feel very comfortable. The only reason I give them 4 instead of 5 is the durability. I am still searching for a shoe that has a very durible heel. I'd like to buy shoes that last 2 or 3 years instead of 1 or less than 1.",

These ones have 4 which is an improvement from 5 and 6 found on other Whithins I've bought. Unfortunately, they just spread them out further rather than moving them further back; no one with wide feet needs eyelets compressing the widest part of the foot.  If anyone from Within reads this, please consider moving the eyelets back towards the heel a little. My only complaint about this pair is the complete lack of heel cushioning. My other Withins all have a comfortable heel cushion. Was this a cost savings thing? I just don't get it.

I have sense bought a second pair to keep for occasions where I want something that looks clean and not used every day for everything. 2 years after purchase and heavy abuse there is still little to no damage, just dirt, stains, and signs of love. I hike, mow, shop, drive, and just about everything else you can think of while wearing these. All seems have held up, upper hasn't rubbed through, soul is still in good condition. I love these. Oh and did I mention I've stepped on glass and nails with these, you can feel a prick but nothing has ever punctured through. Be aware these are barefoot shoes, if you're not used to that type of shoes it will be a big transition for you. Super light shoe, zero drop, very flexible, has releaved a lot of foot pain, wide and over all amazing.",16

The sizing chart was accurate, I usually am 9 - 9.5 women’s shoe size and size 7.5 - 8 (41) fit perfectly. The only thing I didn’t like was the tag placement because I think it makes it look a bit cheap, so I ended up cutting it off.
