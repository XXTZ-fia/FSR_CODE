Having grown up surfing in Hawaii, I'm used to wearing slippers and have fairly wide feet. Unlike my Vans shoes, which tend to squeeze my toes, these fit perfectly! While I love the style of Vans, the Airhas offer a similar aesthetic with exceptional comfort.  The design of the toe box is also fantastic – it avoids the ""clown shoe"" look often seen in barefoot shoes, providing both style and functionality. Sizing is spot-on, aligning with Brannock measurements. In contrast, the Xero Prio felt too narrow and short, even in my correct size. The Whitin Men's Trail Runners also had sizing issues and an awkward design that made them appear disproportionate.  Overall, the Airhas barefoot shoes are a winner – they feel great, look fantastic, and offer excellent value for the price.",

Now, I will say that I really liked the feel and the color and the cushion of the shoe. The fabric and laces were lightweight but not flimsy.

Being simple, they are lightweight and really comfortable. They truly live up to the ""barefoot"" shoe description as they are equally comfortable with ancle socks or no socks at all. Great for the beach or around the pool. They seem like they could get wet with no problem and dry pretty quickly. I got the navy which has a white sole that I think looks really nice, especially with jeans. The 11 wide fit my feet really well (my normal size).

If you're a bigger or heavier person though, you don't want to walk on these on anything but a smooth surface as it's quite uncomfortable. I took a half mile walk down a rural street (no sidewalks) and my feet hurt bad by the time I got back. If you are walking indoors though they are fine. Definitely no slip too.

I think they are very stylish and I like the gum soles. The gum soles also provide ample traction which is nice in different environments. I do not have a wide foot but they are comfortable and they do provide a wider toe box if someone were to need them. If not it is not enormous so you may still wear them without looking like a clown which I was afraid of initially. I ear a size 13 and I ordered a 13. They fit great and are true to size. The material on the top is nylon I think but I am unsure because it stretches. It is a ebony black and seems to be stain resistant.

The second thing I really liked was the breathable top fabric. It's incredibly soft and flexible, so it contours to my foot well. The stretch fabric is not so tight that the top of my foot is compressed, but it's tight enough using the laces to keep the shoe on perfectly. The insole is thin, but the bottom of the shoe is very tacky and provides excellent traction on smooth floors. The size of the shoe is perfect and the flex of the bottom hasn't caused any hotspots. I'm curious how the material will adhere to the sole over time and I'm curious how the sole will hold up, but otherwise I'm very impressed.",

They’re lightweight yet, they still provide a good amount of support. They’re also super comfortable as well. Likewise, the fit is true to size. In all honesty, I like these so much I think I’m going to get another pair and a different color. Highly recommended.",
