I love the wide toe box. It allows my feet to spread out properly without too much extra shoe getting in the way of walking. The canvas on the heel is a little stiff when you first put them on. Hopefully as I wear them more it softens up.,

I love that the back of the shoe where it usually rubs on your heel isn’t too stiff; I made sure to wear longer socks for the first few weeks of wear now it’s not rubbing and giving blisters like other sneakers this style tend to do!

They were not anything like the ones I have previously purchased. They fit different...perfect toe box, but the rest rest of the shoe was wider as well...and the material felt like a very still canvas and wasn't comfortable at all.

I bought white so I could color them myself. They worked great for that. My issue is that while I have wide feet (and a bunion) my feet sort of swim in these from side to side. I added an insole and my feet still slide around. I have found all other canvas shoes too narrow so I was hoping these would be just right. It may be the specific style. Note in the picture that they are pulled tight. I am going to try another Whitin style to see if they have shoes that are a bit more moderate in width or designed so that they can be tightened more easily. Meanwhile, I can wear these standing around, but they aren't good for much walking, with my feet sliding in them. If someone has super super wide feet they might work great!",

I am now a devoted customer! They make a good quality product and it held up well to wear, went through many washes, getting wet and muddy in the rain, used as daily shoe as well as running shoe, hiking and camping shoe and anything in between! I even wore them to a party, don't judge me… because any shoes after these feel like feet prisons! I have “Magical shoes” brand for winter with wool insulation, but I prefer Whitin for it’s wide fit, natural water repellency of the canvases and they comfortably fit a woolen sock inside. Also soles on my Whitin black shoes are sturdier and let less cold in when it is cold then magical shoes do! Wow! May be due to difference in the sole material/density? But I paid $200 for the magical shoes 😅…  So final thought, give them a try! I have been telling everyone about these shoes. No more pain in my feet due to the shoes flexibility, weight and zero drop (no arch support) which took time to adjust but it was so worth it!  Also for someone with feet issues, I personally have been diagnosed with plantar fasciitis about two years ago and even slept in a splint! But who knew that instead of immobilizing, actually working on my feet' strength would cure my diagnosis!? Also no more swelling in my ankles and no more soreness and pain in my knees in the morning, which was also issue I had about a year ago.  The color did fade but no complaint there! It was a year of heavy use and fabric is still solid, soles as you can see in the video are a bit but worn, but I think I will be able to wear them for another year at least 👍",11

I chose these shoes because they were the cheapest. When I first got them, I thought they were too big because there is a lot of room for your toes but after wearing them for a bit, my toes begin to spread out and they just fit perfectly. It doesn’t even feel like you’re wearing shoes! At first, I was concerned about the barefoot, but the zero drop is so comfortable! When I wear other shoes I can tell the difference in my posture and walk. I also feel more connected to the ground without feeling every single rock. The sole is very flexible and and lightweight, so it doesn’t feel like I just have a brick attached to my foot. My only lingering  concern is how long they’re going to last. I have had these shoes for about five months and the souls are starting to wear out. They have also lost some of their color and started to fray a bit at the tip of the toe. However, they are heavily used, due to all my other shoes, feeling incredibly uncomfortable and comparison. I will be buying again and I do recommend the shoes.
