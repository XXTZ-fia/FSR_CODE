Plus, the RFID protection is a great bonus. Highly recommend!",

And it has room for everything I need. But it's difficult to get used to something so different when I have been using a different style for so many years. My old wallet had no flap, the ID holder was on one side and the magnetic money clip was on the other. Between that were leather sleeves for credit cards. This new style actual has a bit more room for more stuff, but the metal is less forgiving in the pocket that my old soft leather version. The cards in this one slap back and forth, unless you fill the inside with exactly the amount of cards to keep them still. The stretchy material on this one to release the cards is rather stiff. Like I say, I want to like this one. It's a 5-star looking wallet, but 3-stars in functionality. Maybe it will take more time to get use to.",

Daughter of time,Very nice,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LAHEMYXQ41JI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRRCKFTP,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: Black Carbon Fiber,,Front pocket wallets are my new favorite thing. The old style back pocket wallet was giving my husband a lot of back and hip problems. You wouldn't think that something that small could cause that many problems but I promise you it can. This front pocket wallet is great because it's lightweight and it holds all the cards that he needs. It's excellently made and highly durable. I like not only the size but the design which flips open and allows you to grab your cards without having to push them out in some weird way like some other front pocket wallets do.,
J. Brown,"Best of both worlds, traditional and aluminum",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NGPYRL0HT8ZA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRRCKFTP,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: Black Carbon Fiber,,"This wallet features a high-tech design combined with a traditional design and look. It is also small both in the outside dimensions as well as thickness. It opens and closes much like the traditional leather wallet that has been standard for decades. Thus, our ID is secure in a plastic holder, yet it is covered for added security. Inside is the card holder much like the modern aluminum tension wallet. It has several slide pockets on the outside that are handy for those cards, or IDs, that are needed often.  At first I found it difficult to get the cards in and out because of the tension plates. However, after I realized that to put cards in a little pressure on the bottom (small, push opening) of the holder opens the top (larger opening) and the cards easily slide right in. And, I had some difficult getting cards out. But I found if I hold the open wallet on the bottom (as I did to put the cards in) the plates open and I can then easily push the cards out. This sounds more difficult that it is and a couple minutes practice makes it quick and easy.  On the outside is a metal money clip that I would never use and a special screw driver is provided to remove it (it also comes with four additional screws). The first screw I tried to remove wouldn't budge but the other screw came out easily and swinging the money clip back and forth a couple times loosened it enough to easily remove that screw. I then screwed the screws into the wallet (without the clip of course) covering the screw holes.  It is well constructed with solid stitching so it shouldn't come apart. I also like the carbon fiber impression in the leather. It is advertised as being RFID protected and I have to believe the that information.  If you prefer traditional leather wallets, this might not be for you. But if you like money clips and want your cards securely held, this wallet does the job well. Add to this a stylish look and very minimalist wallet, this is worth a look.",

It seems super solid, with plenty of card slots and a nice elastic band for cash (or whatever). The manufacturer clearly knows their market: it comes in a pretty nice box emblazoned with ""GREAT GIFT FOR MAN."" No one is going to mistake it for a premium brand, but it's a nice touch.

It has a quality feel to it for me, as if it won't wear out and break in a few months. It is a small, slim wallet for those that don't have many cards to keep track of. It can hold 4-5 inside, 1-2 on the front, and 1 on the back where the cash clip is. it does have a magnet that keeps it closed, and so far it is powerful enough to keep the wallet closed even if it is full and you hold it by the top (opposite side of the cash clip).  And yes, it does have a separate holder for your ID when you open the wallet.  Now, the reason why I am taking a star off is because the top (side with no cash clip) is NOT RFID blocking. I checked this with my phone and 4 separate credit cards and my phone was able to read the chip on my cards with no issues whatsoever. It did block RFID on the side with the money clip or if the cards are inside the wallet (even when the wallet is open).  Images included to show the wallet off.",

The Amazon description does an excellent job of explaining its features. The wallet is presented in a classy gift box which contains the wallet, a screwdriver, and four replacement screws for the metal money clip. On the outside of the wallet are two credit card pockets and a metal money clip. The website implies that these pockets do not have RFID protection, thus would be a good place for a subway pass (you scan the card by tapping the wallet on an access reader so wouldn’t need to pull out the card.) Inside is a window pocket for ID, a credit card pocket that holds 5 cards, and an elastic band to hold cash (the wallet will still close properly with a large wad of cash.) Since you have this elastic band, you have the option of unscrewing the metal money clip, allowing the wallet to be slimmer.  Pros - Totally awesome, modern look, like something you’d get at Sharper Image. Much smaller than a conventional wallet (see photo comparing this wallet to my traditional brown wallet.) High quality construction and finish. RFID shielding so no one can scan your cards. Two places to stash cash.  Cons - The core of the wallet is a hard plastic case and there’s that (removable) metal money clip poking out. This means it's too hard and lumpy to put in a back pocket. But it would work great if you wear a suit, have cargo pockets, or roomy front pockets. The other issue is accessing your credit cards; you have to pull all of them out of the plastic case, sort through to find the one you want, then re-stow them. Your cash will go in either the money clip or the elastic band, which presents a similar problem; you have the pull the entire wad to find the bills you need. But if you are used to money clips, this isn’t a problem. (Idea: Maybe put big denomination bills inside and smaller ones outside?) The door to the inner credit card compartment is very stiff and doesn't open very far. Maybe with more use, the elastic will loosen a bit.  Final take - If you are used to traditional wallets with individual credit card slots and a money pocket, this won’t work. But if you are used to money clips and want a smaller wallet that looks REALLY cool, this is the wallet for you.",

I saw the listing, and it looked really nice. And so far, it's got promise. The packaging is quite nice. The wallet itself has a nice feel, and a nice design. I felt a bit of excitement, thinking this could be something great.  But it seems to suffer from the usual wallet problem. It's a ""minimalist"" design, which means you really can't carry much of anything in it. It says it can carry up to 11 cards, but I'm not convinced. It seems like the credit card pocket is a bit tight, and I only put in four cards. It has a magnetic closure, which I really like... in theory.  It has another pocket for ID. My instinct says that would be a bit of a tight fit, but I carry mine elsewhere, so no matter.  The outside pocket seems like a good place for a couple minor papers- lightweight cards (business card stock). But only a couple.  If you want to carry cash, it features an elastic ""cash strap"" on the inside. Not completely in love with that idea, but it would be only a minor quibble. Except that the bills need to be folded twice (into quarters) to fit inside the wallet without hanging out. And if you do that, then even two or three bills make it bulky. And the lovely magnetic closure becomes ineffective. I suppose the wallet would still be fine, but it worries me. I feel like the elastic will eventually stretch, and then any cash might be at risk. Not really seeing the use. It also has a money clip on the outside, which makes me even more curious about the cash strap. The money clip is fine, but I'm not sure I like carrying money on the outside of my wallet.  I've put my stuff in it, and I'll give it a try for a few days. Maybe it'll grow on me. Maybe I'm not a ""minimalist wallet"" kinda guy, and I'll need to go back to my old one.  As I said in the headline, I dunno. Maybe it's just my personal needs and wants for a wallet, and it'll be wonderful for someone else with different expectations. It's actually very nice. I like it, but not sure it's adequate for me.",

It felt like a stacked wallet when I didn't even add anything to it yet. I carry enough this clipped on mu pants and in many of the cargo pockets I have and it's heavy already.

Everything's held in by screws and very tight elastic you can't even get your finger underneath It's so tight. The carbon fiber is legitimate it's not just for looks and not fake plastic. This also isn't like a cotton, nylon/canvas or bonded leather wallet. This construction doesn't break down, disintegrate, bend or flex in any way and they're heavy. This particular wallet is sewn with visible stitches. It is not bonded with glue. A lot of these claim to be lightweight but I have not encountered that. There is going to be a short adjustment period trying to transition from your old wallet to this one. The RFID feature I can't validate. Nor do I really believe that it's possible that someone can remotely scan your cards since the data they get would be missing the necessary identifiers to carry out large scale fraud or in most cases even a simple transaction. I don't believe RFID is necessary when you buy a wallet. I've never encountered any kind of remote scanning of my food stamps card or my Purina®️ cat litter frequent fillers discount card. So I'm not worried about security unless of course I strap one of my popular bank cards to the outside of the wallet. Yes this wallet has pockets and straps on the outside it sounds like a bad idea, as far as security goes, but these cards are safe, secure and don't ever fall out but the location of the can attract attention. I try not to use them even though they take less time to remove when in a line at the grocery store or at the ATM while impatient people are waiting.  This comes with a micro screwdriver which I assume is to adjust the tension on the straps that I haven't done yet because it hasn't become a problem. And I don't care how long I take to get my cards out and I don't care about the ever-growing line of people behind me.  Losing cards from my flimsy wallets is the reason why I wanted this particular kind of wallet. Let's just hope it lasts longer than 6 months that's if I don't lose it first because it is kind of small.",

Turner Rider,"Nice compact credit card wallet, but why doesn't it come fully assembled?",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFADKLCD9YU4F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRRCKFTP,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 27, 2024",,,"I kept misplacing my wallet so decided to get a new card wallet that I could add an Airtag into, and decided to give this one a try.  It's actually a nice compact wallet with a slide lever to pop your cards up when needed, and a place to hold some cash, but you have to install the clip on the back.  It is simple to do so, but I wonder why they didn't just make it already attached.  With the Airtag installed, and the clip installed, it isn't as compact as I would like, but it is still pretty small compared to a normal wallet.  Overall not a bad choice.",

I'm good at that.  The system works well to make loading and retrieving cards easy, even with one hand. The magnetic closure for the display slot works well and holds it together. The airtag holder is just tight enough to hold the tag in place once you squeeze it in. I haven't used the money clip, but it attaches easily and looks like it would work well.  Overall a very good choice for a thicker minimalist wallet.",

I stumbled across this one and I am glad that I ordered it. Its made out of metal or some other hard material and so its very sturdy. Although its hefty, it still maintains a slim profile because all the cards are in the card holder. The card holder itself is super sturdy and its pretty much impossible for the cards to come out even if you shake the wallet upside down. The air tag holder fit the air tag we had. Overall, my partner loves it and it was a great purchase.",

Milena Lilien,DURABILITY AND MINIMALISM!  GENIUS!!!...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15B5CP176BZ01/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRRCKFTP,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 16, 2024",,,"""Where have you been my whole life?"", I asked my wallet.  This magnetic wallet is the best minimalistic addition to my life since I have been alive.  What else is there to say.  I no longer have to carry around a bulky wallet that creates a bulge in my front pocket.  I have a tendency to store everything in my front pockets.  I have a tendency to sometimes lose my wallet because of mental condition.  Now I no longer go anywhere without attaching this wallet to my smartphone using the built-in magnet.  As a result I misplace my wallet much less often.I can comfortably carry my Driver's License, ATM-Card and 3 other credit cards within this wallet.  When I need a card I simply slide the black switch down on my wallet and all of my cards pop up for me.  I can then choose the one I need at anytime.  Whenever I go to the convenience store or box store, the cashier and people around me marvel at this wallet and ask me where they can purchase one.This is the best wallet I have ever owned.  I've dropped countless times and the trigger spring always works.  It's VERY DURABLE!I will never go back to a conventional wallet again.  Like I said this is the greatest personal minimalistic device I have ever owned, not counting my smartphone.",

He doesn't like carrying a large wallet but this has enough room for his driver's license & credit/debit cards, etc. The card slot for the credit card has a button that pushes the cards up to easily access them. This function work but it does not work smoothly. Sometimes it will push up all of the cards & sometimes only 2 cards. He loves that it is RFID blocking because his cards have been hacked in the past & also that it has the air tag space built in. Overall, he really likes this wallet except for the jerky way the push button part works sometimes.",

This is a great security wallet. I like that the cards push up with a flick of a switch which makes them easy to see and remove. The leather feels and looks good. I don't use the belt clip for wearing it, but it could be used instead to clip receipts. I do wish there was a specified place for receipts, though, which is the only negative in my opinion. I don't used the airtag but it is a nice feature if desired.",
R Warren,"Clunky, magnet doesn't work, cash storage is bad, spring loading is stiff. Not a fan",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FX5CC3GY1XXI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRRCKFTP,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 3, 2024",,,"Wanted this to be my everyday wallet. This is my second minimalist wallet and my other is far superior  This is a nice wallet from initial impression and it feels really nice in your hand. Soft velvet like material and compact with lots of card slots  But almost everything else about the wallet is inferior once you start to use it. The push button for the cards is finicky and didn't work a few times I tried it. Even when it did work, the cards slowly emerged and often clumped together. I really worry about it failing in time and cards being stuck. But even if that doesn't happen, I was finding I needed to manually pull the cards anyways And I didn't overload. It is supposed to hold 7 cards and I was only trying with 4 cards to see the mechanism  The folding and magnet close was one of main features that intrigued me to order. The magnet is good and works well, ONLY IF you do not utilize the card slots. Once you load any cards, it is too weak to magnetize closed. But what would be the point of that? What good is the fold at all if you can't put in any cards without the magnet then being to weak to close?  Overall, this is an inferior product that fails over and over. The large storage is a lie from my experience. It holds likely about 7-8 cards MAX. With all the pockets and storage, it should be far more but then the pockets start not closing or just not working properly. Cash storage is very limited and difficult to insert and remove. I think there are far better options on the market. They may cost slightly more but are significantly better. I would not recommend",
