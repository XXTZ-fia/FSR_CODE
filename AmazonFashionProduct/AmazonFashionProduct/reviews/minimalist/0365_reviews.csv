It is fits my thumb as snugly as my wedding ring does, which is a size 8, so I think this ring is likely a size smaller than stated. But it does fit my thumb well enough. When I wear the rings with the points toward my thumbnail, the skinny one is above the thicker one, and keeps the looser ring from sliding off, so that is a good thing. This is a thin ring, so it may bend easily. I just got it today, and the other ring yesterday, so time will tell. I did some ice-dyeing last night, so I still have blue dye around my nails. Oops.",

I liked that it seemed thinner in band thickness than some others. Very dainty. I bought two in size 6 high polish silver and they are exactly as depicted and true to size. They are solid sterling silver, they will not turn your finger green. They are uniform and two of them stack against each other nicely.  Again, they are delicate and could bend easily if you're not mindful, but that isn't due to a lack of quality, just of how fine they are.
