And the size that I ordered IS his size. And just to make sure, for good measure, I even ordered it in “wide”. And they still managed to be too tight on him too small. Granted, my husband has very large feet, but according to the size requirements in the sneakers, they should have fit him. And though I’m disappointed that they did not, I can still attest to that these shoes appear to be made quite well. I remember them being very very light weight in the hand. And they’re just quite nice looking. So just be aware of the possible size issue, and order accordingly.",

I tried getting some highly cushioned walking/running shoes but that seems to mask the issue.. eventually my feet would still ache. I never thought of myself as having wide feet but knew most shoes don't give enough room for toes to keep its natural shape. Trying these barefoot shoes I instantly felt the difference! The shoes themselves are very thin but soft faux leather, almost feels like wearing a thick sock. I like the insoles but the cork top ripped off on the first wear..  the quality is decent but there's a dimple in the toe box that makes it look cheap/flimsy. I love that they don't look completely like clown shoes!! I'll add a side by side and you really can't tell a difference without staring hard. Overall it's great but wish they polished it further maybe for an extra $10 or so.",4

I love them, but they’re pricey. But I had yet to find an alternative that look just as good.  I got these in the mail today and I couldn’t be happier. They felt weird to wear at first, but then I took the sole out and they are PERFECT. So glad they figured people would take the sole out as well.  They’re look very similar to normal shoes, they’re comfortable, and the no tie strings are the cherry on top.  And for $40?! No brainer.  I can literally replace these 3x before I meet the price of my Feelgrounds. So if they last even a few months before getting tattered, I’d be happy.  Take it from someone who has been wearing barefoot shoes for a couple years and also cares about style, these are it. I’ll be ordering more.  Buy them!",3

If you want to use these for anything remotely active, your feet are going to slide around in the shoe, which isn't ideal, or even concerning for rolling your ankle.I wish brands would quit trying to do silly things like this, or just offer it as an option.For the white version, you can probably find a nice replacement pair of laces to make the shoe good.  For for the other colors - don't think that's happening.  You're not going to be able to match them up well enough.  So you're stuck with a bad lacing system and a sub-par performance shoe.",

Yet, the moment my husband tried it on.. he was smitten!! As one who travels x3-4 monthly for work: walking jobsites, attending conventions, symposiums.. frequenting every International airport miles a day on his feet- it’s not ideal for one who’s post bunion surgery let alone, those with healthy feet may hurt! Trying around town- he couldnt believe how feather light of a shoe it was.. the bamboo cushion is solid for wicking moisture and creating step/arch support. But what he loves is the non constricting toe area… finds it’s far different than a standard “wide width” shoe. Said this has a regular fit throughout.. just extra space where it’s needed most! After x4 days at convention last wk. he had not a single blister by simple pairing with an athletic sock!! No extra bandaid or mule skin like usual.. WoW!!  Shoe itself is easy on/off- offers x2 insoles options.. mine left both in play! Personally, he loves the aesthetics and thinks laces are coolest he’s ever had with the “no tie” system.. plus, he loves the bright orange pop! *This is where I voice my one complaint: losing x1 of the lace stoppers and no replacements online- we had to improvise..!! Seller take note: it would be ideal to include an extra set of lace stoppers bc, at some point these are bound to fall off.. how perfect to have extra set as needed..?!! If nothing else- list as option to buy replacements!  Working Hack: use a 4-6mm silicone round bead with 1.5mm threading hole.. if cut smack down the middle, it creates x2 working lace stoppers and can be done in any color. This was best fix I came up with and wow.. it was a solid solution + worked perfectly. (See pic I included to show my idea.. slide flat half down onto lace!)  Clean enough in look, solid stitching is shown on our pair as you can see.. This design is useful for business casual and comfortable enough for any activity you can think of.. work or play! Hoping info can help you- stay safe everyone.  **UPDATE: 7months later- let's just say he's gotten his moneys worth and then some..!!! Worn almost daily and taken on boating, hiking, biking, vacation adventures.. i'm back for another pair! You can see photos- these will take a beating.. we just need them to look the part again!",4

My problem with them is they’re to right with insert in and too flat footed without, also I can’t figure out how you use them without the part going around your heal without putting it under your heal and that’s not comfortable for me. My feet are temperamental and hard to shop for, I’m going to try them on again in a couple days and see if I get a different result",

They do not provide any support for the sides of your feet so they are better suited for around the house or short walks. The finish of them matches the pictures perfectly and they look good. They definitely give him a good ""barefoot"" feeling, which he needs during his down time from playing sports - these help relieve his tired achy feet.",
Jack Chang,"Stylish, comfortable and versatile!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKCX3K96Z99ZV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLZVPZQP,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 1, 2024",,,"First and foremost, these sneakers are super comfortable. The leather is soft and feels like it's already broken in. The padding around the collar is plush and the elastic laces make this shoe very slip-on/off friendly.  It comes with a sole insert that provides a firm cushion that is supportive, but not pillow soft. Optionally, you can remove this entirely and get a nice zero drop barefoot experience. The heel is also collapsible so you can wear these as mules or house slippers.. and they are also pretty stylish.  Overall a nice pair of shoes that is versatile and very affordable.",

You can have aero dynamics and style in cars, so can you have comfort and style in shoes.  As a long time fan of the styling of the Nike Airforce One or Court, these are perfect. They are like flat wide versions of those. They are also very light weight, flexible and easy to get on and off. They look good and I have enjoyed walking around in them today. I did not experience any fatigue and traction is great.  That said, let's address the negatives, which are both related to the material. Firstly, it is very thin and I am worried about longevity. Secondly, as a vegan leather aka pleather, they do make my feet sweat a bit. I will continue to wear them and see what comes of it. If they hold up a year and a different sock helps in the other area, I will certainly be changing my rating to 5 stars and buying all the colors available, in multiples. Who knows how long these gems will remain available.",4

The wide-toe design ensures my feet have plenty of room to move and breathe, making them incredibly comfortable to wear all day long.  And let's talk about the craftsmanship. The upper is crafted from premium soft-touch PU leather, which not only looks sleek but also feels incredibly soft against my skin. The strategically placed air holes ensure superior breathability, keeping my feet cool and fresh even on the hottest days. And the padded lining adds an extra layer of comfort and stability, making these shoes perfect for long walks or days on your feet.  The insoles are where the real magic happens. With sweat-absorbing wooden chips and high-density memory foam, they offer unparalleled arch support and cushioning. I've never felt so supported in a pair of shoes before! And the durable rubber outsoles provide excellent slip resistance, giving me peace of mind with every step.  What I love most about these shoes is their versatility. The collapsible heel counter makes them easy to slip on and off, so I can wear them as slippers around the house or as regular shoes for running errands. And the adaptive lacing system means I never have to worry about tying my shoes again - a small detail, but one that makes a big difference in my daily routine.  And let's not forget about maintenance. The reinforced seam connections between the upper and outsole increase durability, so I know these shoes will last me for years to come. And because they're so easy to clean, I can spend less time worrying about upkeep and more time enjoying the comfort they provide.  Plus, the fact that they're odorless is a huge bonus. I can feel good about wearing these shoes knowing that they're environmentally friendly and won't emit any unpleasant smells.  These barefoot design shoes have exceeded all my expectations, and I would highly recommend them to anyone in search of comfort, quality, and style.",
Tacha,Great comfort for wider feet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YXCIKU9005PX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLZVPZQP,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 15, 2024",,,"One of my sons has very wide feet and I usually order him a size 13 in shoes, which is about 2 sizes more than he should need length-wise to get shoes to fit him. He usually only wears boots, as those seem to provide him with more comfort. I ordered these Barefoot Wide Toe Box Shoes for Men in a size 12, hoping that since they were made with wide feet in mind, a size 13 wouldn’t be needed. I’m very happy I took the chance. My son was a tad hesitant at first, seeing as he hasn’t worn anything but boots in years. I asked him just to try them on so I could review them. They must have felt really good on his feet, because I have now seen him wear them to school every day of the week! Teenagers are hard to please, so I know I can fully recommend these shoes. He says they are super comfortable. An added bonus is that you don’t have to tie these shoes. The laces are somewhat elastic, making it easy to put these shoes on. The little red stoppers on the ends, keep the laces in place. So, these shoes are very handy for people who are unable to tie their laces. When he stepped in these shoes for the first time, they felt a little tight on his little toes. However, I moved the laces around a bit, and they adjusted and gave him more space. Overall, we’re very happy with these shoes. They look nice, are practical, and feel comfortable.",4
