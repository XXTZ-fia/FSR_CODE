I didn't notice in the pictures, or didn't realize what it was, but the black tag at the bottom is stitched all around and is part of the shirt - I really dislike having crap like that on a shirt when I can't remove it.

It looks neat and dressy/casual.  The material isn't cotton but it seems to wear cool enough. It looks to be well made and it has already made it through the wash and dry here as everything at my house must!

When I button it up, the fit feels a bit off around the shoulders and back. I have a fairly broad back, and the material doesn't have a lot of stretch to it when I move so it binds across the back quite a bit. When that happens, the shirt also rides up for some reason, so the material that should be laying flat across my shoulders sticks up halfway to my ears.

I am a big fan of blue clothing. It just looks good on me. This shirt is further proof of that. It is so good looking. I got the light blue option.  The extra large fits appropriate to that size, and you are looking at a 100% polyester shirt that feels so comfortable and smooth on my skin.  The shirt looks wrinkled in the photograph I attached. That is because I took the picture after I got the shirt right out of the bag. After washing and wearing it, it is basically wrinkle free.  I live in Florida so there is a need for light, airy, comfortable but good looking shirts year-round. This fits the bill in every regard. Very happy.  By the way, the stitching is excellent. I didn't find a problem anywhere on the shirt with the stitching or the buttons. It looks great and I am super pleased.",

I will most likely wear it open with a shirt underneath and this style and fit are excellent for this. My only issue with this shirt is the color is off. It was supposed to be green. Maybe under the right light with the correct filter it will appear green, but I don't have those lights. It is more of a gray under the normal lights of my house. Outside it could maybe even a very be a faint hint of blue but no green. What you see in the picture appears to almost be a texture to the fabric. It is not. It is the print and how the color is laid down. It could be called a heather gray or maybe they were going for a heather green. Either way, it does not appear as the color described to me.",
