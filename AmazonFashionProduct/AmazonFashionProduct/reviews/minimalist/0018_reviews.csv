𝚂𝚊𝚐𝚎𝚋𝚛𝚞𝚜𝚑,Awesome gift!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MTKV9D0OXW2T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D16YBS7Y,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 31, 2024",Size: 8#,Verified Purchase,This ring is Soo pretty! It does fit a bit big and doesn’t have an exact ring size. I got 8mm and it fit perfect for a 7 - 7.5. It looks more blue than a regular moonstone looks but it’s very pretty. Totally recommend!,
