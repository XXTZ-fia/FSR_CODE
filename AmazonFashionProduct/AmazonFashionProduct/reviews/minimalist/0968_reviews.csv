I bought them for cross training and 15 min warm up walks outside. Received July 11th today is July 15th. They look rad, I feel rad, and the shoes are super lightweight. Fit I ordered 9.5. I wear 10.5-11 typically depending on the brand and style of shoe. I have narrow feet so I ordered about 1 size down based on the size chart and they fit great. The toe box could be a bit wider but maybe they are meant to stretch. Overall, I call it a moderately roomy toebox- not restricting but toes spread to both side when walking. Comfort Surprisingly comfortable without any real cushioning. My high arches have always caused pain unless cushioning is maxed out. No arch pain with these. Think strapping a piece of tire to the bottom of your foot- zero concerns about walking on rocks. Durability Durability is a major concern for me. I have walked 1 mile on 2 occasions and lifted weights (upper body parts) in them twice. Not much usage yet as I intentionally adjust to this type if shoe. Already, the sole has begun to separate from the shoe. For this, I will return and consider another brand. The materials used seem to be high quality but I have read other reviews that confirm I did not receive a rare lemon. This is a legit design flaw or glue quality issue that should be addressed. Summary Everything TSLA promises except for durability. 4 days and under 3 miles and they are pulling apart. I am now very excited to jump on the barefoot bandwagon just not with this brand.",3

Why?  1 - I can wear them without socks. They have a good feel and don’t get too smelly either. I walk at least 10k steps in them barefoot every day and have had no problems (2 months).  2 - Fit. Some other BF shoes (cough Tolos cough) I’ve simply never enjoyed the fit. Bought two pairs REALLY wanting to like them, and they just aren’t doing it for me. I choose my TESLA kicks over TOLOS near daily. Sure, they don’t look QUITE as cool for a casual shoe, but their utility is no doubt better.  3 - Price. I’m not precious about them. I know I can beat them into the ground and then get another pair if need be. I love my Feelgrounds, but they wear out within a few months, and for $170 it’s always kind of a bummer. So I don't wear them as much cause I'm afraid I'll wear out the tread.  Can’t recommend these enough for sport + casual walking/running. They also don’t look super nerdy.

The zero drop that they are with the roomie toe box makes the shoe kinda on the loose side and when walking on a department store floor, they slap. I didn’t like that. The other thing I noticed was that only after 3 wears the bend line at the front of the shoe is starting a small crack in the material. It hasn’t grown much more than in the photo after way more wears but it’s a concern. I would suggest using the inserts as I feel it makes the shoe way better. For the price you can’t beat them. I was a fan of the New Balance minimalist sneaks but they don’t seem to make the ones they use to. So far this has been the next best thing. Very true to size.

I have not yet put them to use.  First, the red trail runners look amazing.  I really want these to work out because they look so good.  When it comes to fit and feel, I have to concur with another reviewer who notes that if you are used to wide toe box minimalist shoes, these very noticeably feel more narrow from the midsole to the ball of the foot. The toe box is wide, but the extra width doesn't extend far enough down the shoe leaving the shoe feeling ""tight"".  The material also feels a little stiff or scratchy out of the box compared to other shoes. I like that there is no removable insole, but the bottom of the inside of the shoe feels rough especially if you are used to not wearing socks.  Because I love the look of them so much I will be trying to wear these in to see if they will adjust to my foot and soften up a bit. If they don't I will be returning.",

I've been a barefoot style runner and hiker and used just about every brand and style available.  I've been in the barefoot game since before there was a barefoot running book published (we used Pose Technique back then).  I'm just establishing myself as experienced with barefoot shoes.  So, what do I think of these Tesla ""Merrell Vapor Glove"" knock offs?You get what you pay for - meaning you get a $35 version of a $100 shoe.  The quality is evident in the material chosen and the workmanship.  The fabric is definitely durable and, if not abused, will last until the sole wears smooth.  That's great.  On my Tesla shoes, the glue connecting the sole to the fabric was visible in sections.  This is a $35 shoe that is well worth the investment. But the fabric also looks and feels like inexpensive nylon and not up to the same look and feel as you'll see with name brand shoes like Nike, adidas, Puma, Merrell, Vivobarefoot, etc.If I were to rank the quality of materials and workmanship with the major barefoot shoes brands selling on Amazon.... Vivobarefoot is an easy first.  Merrell is second.  Xero Shoes is third.  Whtn is fouth.  Telsa is firth.  This is not to say Tesla is junk construction. It's not.  It's just not as high quality looking - but the shoes are durable, well designed and perfect for their purpose.For 1/3 the price these Telsa barefoot shoes are perfect for someone testing out barefoot style shoes.  The thin sole, 0mm drop, and no arch support is absolutely perfect for a barefoot shoe.  These Tesla will give you a true barefoot shoe experience.If you are testing out barefoot shoes, or need a cheaper barefoot shoe for running, hiking or the gym, these are perfect.  They cost 1/3 the price of the Merrell Vapor Gloves they mimick.  As so many other reviewers have said, and as the photo shoe, these are basically Merrell Vapor Glove 3 or 4 shoes.My advice is... BUY THESE ... if you want to try barefoot running shoes for the first time or if you are an experienced barefoot runner, walker or hiker and need a sport style shoe that can withstand your workouts.At $35 these Teslas are incredibly inexpensive.  At $100 Merrell Vapor Gloves are better made, look higher quality and have a name brand.  Plus they created the design that Tesla imitated.  At $130 Xero Shoes have about the same (maybe a little less) quality than Merrell and have more choices.  At $170 Vivobarefoot are the premium barefoot shoe, used the most durable and best looking fabrics, but I wouldn't trash Vivos hiking or at the gym... not when I can use a $35 dollar shoe... or get a Merrell or Xero Shoe on sale.Click like if this review helped you.

After a month is use the sole and the upper on outside of the (left) shoe (along the black rubber glued-on design) started to separate. About a week later the same thing started on the outside of the right shoe. Now the shoe is starting to come unglued on the inside of the left shoe.

I usually wear 12.5 or sometimes 13 in Nike, Asics, Adidas, etc. The size 12 of these fit me correctly.  DISCOLORATION: There was a ton of visible white glue visible on the upper part of the shoe where the fabric meets the rubber/synthetic sole. There were also at least a couple spots where it apparently dripped another inch or two onto the fabric, leaving a darker stain where they may have tried to clean it up. I showed some of this in the photos (1 & 2.)  APPEARANCE - WEIRD FABRIC FOLDS: It's as if the fabric wasn't cut correctly so there is extra material piling up in weird folds. (Example in photo 3.) There are a bunch of folds the fabric on the sides of the shoe and at the top near your toes. Sometimes a lightweight fabric upper shoe can have a bit of a fold near the toes and that's normal, but these are by far the worst I've seen and include a bunch of folds on the sides.  COLOR: Last nitpick is these are labeled as green on both Amazon and the packaging, but are clearly very blue in person and on the Amazon photo. There's a little bit of teal, but nobody would call this green. The photo is pretty accurate so I wasn't surprised. These should just be labeled as blue.  COMFORT: Overall the comfort was okay, but I've tried several other similar priced, competing lightweight shoes on Amazon (Whitin and Orangineer for example) and I liked this shoe the least. The wide toe area is indeed nice. Usually my big toe feels cramped in normal shoes.",3

Timzzilla,Light and comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17Q3FPNTNBND3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081RYBP52,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 22, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"This is my first entry into a pair of minimalist/barefoot type shoe and so far I like it. I normally wear a 10.5 wide but since there are no 1/2 sizes the recommendation was that I order an 11. They're a good .5"" too long but the width is good with the toe width being roomy and my toes feeling relaxed and not pinched together. One of the things I couldn't find before buying was the weight of these shoes. Each one is 209g, about 100g lighter than my usual running Asics shoes. I Iike feeling the terrain under my feet but like having some protection for my soles. These are very comfortable. Running in these is a little different in that I'm more on the front of my foot and my calves can really tell the difference. I only use them for running and only have about 15 miles on them so far and I'm curious how they'll hold up but do far so good.",

The width was fine, and I have a wide foot.  I normally wear Merrills so these appealed to me.  I thought they looked good.  Had they fit, I would have kept them.  I’m not sure what the issue is - other than my foot.  LOL.  They may be perfect for you.  I just found the 11 to be oddly long, with a bunch of toe space.",

Only wore for light use in the gym. Never trails or outside the gym.  Pretty disappointed. Money better spent elsewhere.,
Ridin Bicycles,Comfortable for walking but not for running. yet?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CH7B6QOJKTLK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081RYBP52,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 5, 2024",Color: Barefoot Shoes Black CamoSize: 12,Verified Purchase,"Thin sole shoes allow/cause your feet to feel every bump and crack on the ground. Hard at first to get used to heavy heel impact and ankle/shin muscle strain when walking on concrete (parking lot, walking trails, tile floor) but OK now.  If just starting out or going to wear them all day then cover your regular sock with a second ankle-high sock 1/2 way up just past the heel... then, with 3-4 inches still hanging past the toes, fold the remaining sock length flat under your arch and possibly heel. Will add a little softness and will also help shoes fit snugly until feet are used to them.",

Jeffrey Samosir,Uncomfortable and Caused Injury,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RE2L43TWJULJI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081RYBP52,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2024",Color: Barefoot Trail BlueSize: 7,Verified Purchase,"I recently purchased the TSLA zero-drop barefoot shoes, being a fan of this type of footwear. My excitement quickly turned to disappointment during my first run. Barely a mile in, I felt a sharp pain on the top of my right foot. Upon inspecting, I discovered that the shoe had caused a wound.  The primary issue seems to stem from a hard layer in the shoe's design, which is surprisingly aggressive against the skin, even with socks on. This is quite concerning as the fundamental purpose of running shoes is to provide comfort and support during physical activities. Unfortunately, this model failed to deliver on both fronts.  I wanted to love these shoes, but I cannot recommend them due to the discomfort and injury they caused. Potential buyers should be aware of this flaw and consider it when making their decision.",2
erdmann,"1 Size Too Big, Roomy Toe Box",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA3LERXLAU005/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081RYBP52,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2024",Color: Barefoot Shoes Black CamoSize: 13,Verified Purchase,"The shoes are big.  I usually wear 12 1/2 but there was none so I bought size 13 and they are too big.  12s would probably work.  Very light and large toe box.  The sole is thin so don’t step on stones.  Also the black camo does not look anything like the pictures; it is just a series of horizontal lines.  If they hold up they are well worth the price.  REVISION:  After checking, I discovered AMAZON sent the wrong shoes,  that is why they don't look like camo.  Even the black shoes I received do not match the black shown on the Amazon site.  I probably received an old pair no longer in production.",
