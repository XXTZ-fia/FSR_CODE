A&J H.,Love these shoes but it arrived with two different length of shoelaces?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R191VG0POTJ7WR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWSFSPKL,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 3, 2025",Size: 8Color: White,Verified Purchase,"Transitioning to barefoot shoes and purchased these as I liked the style. However, for the longest time I was wondering why the bow loops were different sizes. I readjusted the laces about a dozen times wondering if I had gone crazy. Eventually I removed them and found they were actually two different lengths. Not sure if this is a defect from Amazon or Xero, but it was a brain puzzler. I did buy a separate pair of laces and don't have any issues, but wow, that was weird. Otherwise, the shoes feel great and I love the space and freedom within the toe box. I have since bought more from Xero and am excited to be on this wide toe box/barefoot shoe journey. **Be cautious if you live in a place that gets rained on a lot (the PNW), put on some hydrophobic spray so you don't get your shoes constantly soaked or overly dirty. I knew what I was getting myself into when buying white shoes and did get them dirty, but cleaning with a soft brush, dish soap, and lukewarm water helped get the stains out of the toe area of the sneakers. However, there is still a small stain on the back of the shoes that I wasn't able to get off. I'd recommend these, but try to check the lace length if you're buying from Amazon.",

Initially, I thought the sole could be a few millimeters thicker, but after wearing them for a while, I think they're perfect as they are. It would be great to have this Dillon model unchanged and also a version with two more millimeters of cushioning for long days on your feet. Even if they never change it, I still believe it's one of the best, if not the best, barefoot shoes available today. This is coming from someone who has bought all the Vivo barefoot shoes, all the Toppo shoes, and even the worst ones, ULTRA, who completely abandoned their original design. I've also tried various other zero-drop shoes that most people aren't familiar with. There's usually always a problem, from a terrible chemical odor to the toe box being too wide or too narrow. Xero really nailed it with the Dillon. I wake up without any foot pain after wearing them. Quite remarkable. Good job, guys. Let me know if you discontinue this shoe.

I like how the shape of the sole appears to be very solid, but is actually very flexible. In addition, these shoes offer good ground feel and traction. The only thing that I don't like about them is that the toe box is too narrow for me and my pinky toes end up getting squished. The balls of my feet are relatively wide though, so this could work for someone with narrower feet. For comparison, I have worn other barefoot shoes such as Whitins and they are a bit too wide for my feet, and the Altra Escalantes are the perfect width for my foot.  I decided not to return these shoes even though the toe box is a bit narrow since I really do like the aesthetics of this shoe and it is a good fit for more sedentary activities.

The shape and style of this shoe is ok, still noticeably wider and more ""orthopedic"" looking than the average. The feel is true to what I expect from Xero. The tragedy, however, is that the fabric of this shoe is a total dirt magnet. I've had to wash them almost every time I wear them, and the process requires using a cleanser and toothbrush to lift the dirt from the textured fabric and address all the holes and crevices. The fabric also seems to suck up any dirty street water you might accidentally encounter, leaving a visible water line after it dries.  Seems like the worst fabric choice ever for a shoe. I understand the desire for breathability, but I feel resistant to wearing them knowing I'll just need to clean them again. I guess I could try a waterproofing spray, but there are already stains that I can't get out, so the look is already compromised. I imagine it might be better if you get the black? A disappointing experience for me and just wanted others to be aware.",2

Of course the white is hard to keep clean but going to soak them in oxi clean and they are cloth so super easy to wash. They remind me of old school adidas with the shell toe but they are super soft and flexible. Perfect traveling shoes,5

I came across these and liked how they looked so ordered. They are incredibly comfortable and helping with foot and leg placing. My only criticism is they come up slightly small and I would order the next size up next time. Great introduction to barefoot shoes!,

They get a little dirty easily but are also easy to clean. They're lightweight, too which is always a plus for tennis shoes.",
