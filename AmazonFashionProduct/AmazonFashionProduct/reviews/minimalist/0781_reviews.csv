It appears that the fabric was sewn bunched up somehow. I didn’t notice until I actually wore them in the water. It was really uncomfortable and felt like the fabric was slipping during my water aerobics. I already had to send back a previous pair because they have the 7.5 listed as a size 39 in European sizing which really it’s supposed to be 38 so I sent the 7.5 back and got the 7. The 7 fits much better. I really don’t want to hassle of returning these too so if I could get a replacement for the right insole that would be great and I would change my rating. As far as performance, other than the odd feeling, they feel wonderful! I have high arches so the arch support is great for doing my water aerobics! A lot easier on my joints too.
