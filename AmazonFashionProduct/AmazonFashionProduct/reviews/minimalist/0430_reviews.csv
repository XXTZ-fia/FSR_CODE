Very comfortable, true to size, good grip, and have so far seemed to maintain nice durability. I have the low tops and the high top styles and did notice the high tops are slightly wider in the toe area than the low tops. Both work great for my feet though. Highly recommend!",7

I wear these as my ""white keds"" style sneakers, since name brand Keds are too narrow and crunch up my toes. I thought they might look a bit clownish since the toe box is so square, but they really don't--they're pretty low profile and not clunky. If you like a lot of arch support, these aren't for you. One downside is they don't breathe super well so they do get stinky, but they are machine washable. Some other commenters mentioned rivets popping out after a few wears, and that has not happened to me on any of my three pairs.",4

This is the first pair I bought in regular width. A weird thing I noticed in them is the interfacing in the toe is more stiff and noticeable in this pair. I hope it doesn't become more noticeable as they get worn in. They are comfortable but I can only wear them sockless. With socks they are too snug. So if you have wide feet you might consider the wide width. This is a great shoe to start off your bear foot experience. Price is much more reasonable than other name brands. I have also tried out the generic brands on Amazon and the quantity is not as good.,5

I understand that these are knockoff Vivos, but I was hoping for at least one year of wear before having to replace them. I don't wear these everyday, and yet, they only lasted 10 months, as the soles in my current pair are falling apart. Reminds me of the boot theory where I'll wind up spending more money on these shoes until I'm able to afford a pair of Vivos which will probably last multiple years.  Despite my complaints, the shoes are reasonably comfortable, it is indeed wide toebox, and I'm grateful for that. Just be mindful that these are made with low quality materials, and if you wear them regularly, you'll probably need to replace them within 6 months.",7
