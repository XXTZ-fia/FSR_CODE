They are close, but they do not quite measure up to what I was expecting.  They are comfortable when standing, but the heels seem lower than what I am accustomed to wearing, When I walk in these shoes I feel like my foot is pointed in the air. I may try to find some old shoe inserts that I stuck in a closet, they are half sole in length and should raise the heel.  The listing describes ""...with reinforced heel won’t be deformed when you slip in without bending over, just slip in these and go."" When I tried that it did not work, it could be that I need to practice, but for now I have to sit down and put these shoes on.  I realize that we each have different feet and thus different shoes. I think that these shoes will feel more comfortable over time, but I need the time.",
