Love that they’re barefoot shoes and easy for our girls to slip on. They hold up pretty well to the every day wear of an 18 month old and a 6 year old who run wild most of the day. They’re fairly quick to dry when they get wet and easy to wash (we just throw them in the washing machine). My 6 year olds last pair started to rip a hole on the top layer of canvas (so not all the way through) about the time she was growing out of them and considering we got them when she grew out of the pair before that, I’d say it was perfect timing and well worth the money spent. Oh and my girls love that they can have matching pairs! It’s so hard to find that in shoes for their 5 year age gap, let alone being barefoot shoes!",
