Don Aspromonte,Best money-clip I have ever had...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YVNEUVGRA2G3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZKQ539,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 26, 2024",Color: Black and Silver 01,Verified Purchase,"My wife liked it so much I bought one for her, also!  I needed a convenient way to carry just a few dollar bills and a couple of credit cards when I didn't need the whole stack of cards in my pocket.  The money clip is exceptionally clever. It expands enough to carry a bunch of one-dollar bills and still works when I have just a few bills.  The cards are easy to see and slip in and out without being loose in my pocket.  I didn't want the coin on the clip, but it adds just the right amount of weight to the whole package.  My wife and I both love it!",
Kindle Customer,Light and small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R164HGXBQBM4Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZKQ539,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 13, 2024",Color: Dark Brown and Gold 03,,"I have tried other minimalist clip wallets and they all seem to have the flare at the end of the clip that either digs into your leg or your pants. I honestly thought this looked too simple to be any good but got it just to see.  It immediately became my favorite. Yes, you have top pull all your cards out each time, but let's be honest, I did with the other ones too no matter what gimmick they seemed to have to access cards easier. At least this one is honest, and it is easy to pull them all and get what you need then out them back.  At first I thought the coin clip didn't hold bills strongly, and then I discovered that I wasn't putting them back far enough and that it actually grips them very tightly.  So I ended up loving it. It is light enough and small enough that I often don't notice it is still in my pocket after work, and I used to take my wallet out immediately. I am very pleasantly surprised.  It also comes with a jewelry polishing cloth and something that looks sort of like an emery board in a bag with Chinese writing. Mine did not come with a little metal box like the picture. I didn't care, but you might?",
Kim,Great Money Clip with Classy Design,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JI4WEO4JR0D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZKQ539,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 10, 2024",Color: Dark Brown and Gold 03,,"A money clip is a great way to carry your important cards and cash without the bulk of a regular wallet. I love the design of this money clip. It's made of leather with a gold coin style clip. It holds my drivers license, credit cards and cash with ease and feels very small in my pocket. It's supposed to hold up to 6 cards, but I think 4 or 5 is more realistic as it gets very tight with more than that. Overall, this is a very nice money clip with a classy design.",
professorwagoner,A classy Micro-Wallet that actually works well for me!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22ZLVJ27OEO6U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZKQ539,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 5, 2024",Color: Dark brown and sterling silver coin 02,,"The leather is soft and supple but also very thick. The leather part holds 1 to 4 cards and as long as I have my drivers license and a debit card along with some banknotes, I am ready for the day. I carry this wallet while at work as it is not bulky like my other wallet is, and does not make a large bulge in my clothing. A slim and well made wallet/money clip/card holder. The medallion is marked .999 AG, and is an interesting design. The money clip does not work well with more than 7 bills. This is worth the money, and just looks classy and expensive. Several people have already asked me where I got it, it is that impressive in person.",
D. Rowlett,swank money clip with card wallet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MS6RXUO79DTJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZKQ539,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 3, 2024",Color: Black and Silver 02,,Sharp and stylish. The money clip and wallet are detachable. Minimalist in function. Recommended.,
Marconelli,"Works well, but ...",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1N2ZXCQHGNPG5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZKQ539,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 1, 2024",Color: Dark Brown and Gold 02,,"This money clip is truly leather and quite slim and attractive. The leather card holder fits a card very tightly, so tightly that it would be difficult to push in more than 2 or 3 cards. It would be better if the card holder were a little broader.  The clip for bills is very strong, but I don't know how long it will remain tight. However, there are instructions on how to tighten the clip if it becomes less effective. Right now the money clip holds 9 folded US bills and 1 credit card comfortably.  Because the gold clamp is attached to the pouch through the leather, the more bills you clip into it, the less space there is for credit cards. (see interior of holder in 3rd photo.) If you put in, say, 15 folded bills, the interior portion of the clamp bulges and when as you insert a credit card, the card catches on the metal of the clip, making it very unmanageable.  So for a few bills and 1 or 2 credit cards this works well. I like it.",
Timberwork,Unique well made,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MF37M08V1JW4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZKQ539,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 28, 2024",Color: black and sterling silver coin 01,,This is a well made unique wallet or money holder the design functions nicely the leather and stitching is nice and free of defects the coin insert is definitely unique and a nice touch which you could pick the coin and wallet separately but they do have most options available,
Beaker,Nice looking men's leather money clip/wallet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNTTTOWDNUHS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZKQ539,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 27, 2024",Color: Dark Brown and Gold 02,,"I ordered this leather men's money clip as a gift for my brother. I was pleased when it arrived because it is really a nice looking leather money clip/wallet. I'm not usually good at scouting out great gifts (ha ha ha) but I really did a great job with this one! It is nice quality and should hold up with being used day after day. I think the coin on the front looks very ""sharp"" and gives it a nice touch of class while still keeping it ""manly"". I am positive my brother will like it and I recommend this item if you're looking for that gift for a man in your life or even for yourself.",
HONEST REVIEWER,Neat little money holder,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MDTX7MDLKMAD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZKQ539,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 23, 2024",Color: black and sterling silver coins 02,,"This money holders pretty cool. I like the design of it. I got the skull Kennedy. I guess you will call it and it’s a lot more convenient than carrying a wallet. It’s got room for a couple of credit cards, which is plenty for me and you can carry bills in it or fold them over.",
