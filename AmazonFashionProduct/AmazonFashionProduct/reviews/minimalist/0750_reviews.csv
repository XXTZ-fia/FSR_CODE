I received no indication that they got my email, so 3 days later, I sent another email just as instructed on their website. I never heard back from them. They have a chat on the website, so I submitted my request via the chat...I got nothing back from the chat for 5 days. I gave up trying to deal with the company and came here on Amazon to order the next size up for me. This way, if they don't fit, at least Amazon will be responsive.",

NBs don't have any which Isn't necessarily a bad thing. The sole is also thicker but doesn't hinder the barefoot feel too much. My only ""big"" gripe is that the tounge should be sewn in place.

Upon delivery, I found that the black pair is actually a water shoe. They do not have the breather holes in the upper...just solid neoprene type material like you'd see on a water shoe.  I didn't want to go through the whole return process, and I needed to get to the gym.  Surprisingly, my feet weren't a sopping mess by the time I was done! Even after I rode the motorcycle to the gym in the Florida heat. Very surprising. I'm sure the nice cotton socks had a lot to do with that, though.  Super comfortable shoes. Ran a mile on the treadmill after my workout, and no discomfort there. My feet definitely felt the run in a different way, though. Sorta feels like my feet got a bit of a workout as well, which is what I was after with this type of shoe.  We'll see how they hold up. Next time, I'd definitely get one of the other pairs with the breather holes. Also, the black pair doesn't have the quick tie system. FYI",6

I have been searching for the perfect zero drop hiking shoe for summer. As a heavier hiker I need a thicker sole to protect my feet from being bruised by stones. I also have an ankle instability on one side which can cause my foot to supinate heavily and soft soled shoes amplify this making walking painful over time and dangerous on uneven ground. Most barefoot style shoes have very thin soles with loads of ground feel, great for the instability but really not a good idea for a heavy person as we do need a bit more cushion and shock absorption on hard ground. So I was pretty happy to find these. They feel great. Fit is snug but comfortable. I can walk comfortably over large gravel and other surfaces.I have taken them out on a few walks now and in water and out, dirt trails, steep rocky slopes and they performed so well. No slipping and moving on my feet even when wet. Good traction on steep terrain. Fit is true to size. I prefer men's shoes for hiking so I ordered the men's 8.5 which is what I usually wear. My toes have just enough space without a lot of extra to trip me up.",7
