Amazon Customer,Finally found a Slip on that fits!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLIXM0EGV0BGC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C6ZKNQVV,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",Size: 11 WideColor: W863 | Black White,Verified Purchase,This shoe is an answer to my prayers. I have finally found a wide toe box and low to the ground slip on shoe that looks decent. Based on initial impressions this shoe is great.  Some qualms about the grip and flexibility. But I'll add that star after 30 or so days of use.,

So, I bought these slip-on's to wear around the house and in my shop.  These are absolutely not like the other Whitin shoes I get.

I use Altra shoes for (zero drop and wide toebox) for walking, errands etc.  I usually wear sz 12 running shoes so I got sz 13 in the Whitin shoes as 12.5 was not offered and I wanted something wide enough for around the house shoes.  The 13s were a bit too wide but ok if wearing thicker socks  I can also wear toe spacers in them when I want.
