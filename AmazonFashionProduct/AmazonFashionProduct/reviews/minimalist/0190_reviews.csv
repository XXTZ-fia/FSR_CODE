They excel in providing a close-to-ground experience, making them a fantastic option for those seeking to replicate barefoot movement. However, the design falls short in one critical area: width. Despite their otherwise thoughtful construction, these shoes lack the spacious toe box typically associated with barefoot footwear, leaving the fit too narrow for those with wider feet. While they shine in comfort and flexibility, their limited width diminishes the overall appeal, especially for wearers prioritizing natural foot splay.",

I was curious when I saw these and ordered them. I am truly impressed with how comfortable these are. Remember that there is no tongue, just the enclosed shoe that stretches to get your feet in and laces to ensure tight fit. I have been wearing them for walks (3 to 4 miles per day). They are on the heavy side for this profile of shoes. That could be because of the dense rubber sole which also causes the shoes to be less cushioning than other in the same category. With that said, the rest is very positive. I could wear these for hours at a time. There are no pinching points, no rubbing to cause blisters. They are very flexible and provide great stability while exercising.",

I was looking for a shoe that wouldn't contort my foot or ankle into an unnatural position.

These shoes delivered on what I was looking for and I like the feel enough to want to wear them outside of the gym too. The cushioned heel counter is a big plus as well. Only con I've found is that they like to try to slip off your foot at more extreme extensions, it would be nice if there was a way to lace them so that your heel is more locked in.

They don't have a traditional tongue which was surprising; the entire upper is once piece but you don't notice it while wearing. It's easy to slip the shoes on and off (they're almost like socks) and I really like the pull tab they added, though we'll have to see the durability. I like the vinyl toe and heel covers -- can we get more of this in the barefoot world please? They come with a simple foam insole which is thin enough to give you ground feel but not too thick and there's also some nice padding around the back of the heel as well. It feels built well enough.  Like other reviews mention there's some extra pointy room ahead of your big toe and the toe box isn't particularly wide (I got a 10.5 US M which is my normal sneaker size) but they fit well in width for the rest of the foot. In Whitins I can splay my toes all I want but I can see my pinky in particular rubbing at full splay with these but its not terrible. If you're considering sizing down to mitigate the extra pointiness, don't. I also think they look way sharper than the whitins I have. The tags are reflective FYI.

Most pairs are dorky and obviously ""different"" than a normal shoe. The fact that its all woven too ise nice because it means its less likely to just fall apart compared to shoes that all glued together, and its more form fitting without rubbing because the top is basically a sock. THis is VERY similar to some vivobarefoot shoes and has some of the same issues.  Initially I was concerned I needed another half size or up would maybe return them because the tongue of the shoe felt tight and stiff. Maybe it would loosen up but I didn't like how much pressure it put on the front where my foot meets my shin. This is true of the leather vivobarefoots I bought for work and stopped wearing. Fortunately I remembed I can pull out the insole which I prefer anyway to get a more barefoot feeling. With the insole out they feel way better and I'm now likely going to get at least one more pair in another color. I wish they had all black (which is now instock in my size). I'll leave another review after putting some miles on them, but I think I'll like these way more than some other shoes I've spent over $100 that fell apart and had other issues (looking at you Xero and vivobarefoot)  The tongue is still stiff. The sizing sticker fell off the but left some of the vinyl or adhesive. The tonge got a little more comfortable when that happened and I suspect itll be better when it comes all the way off.  One thing to note is that the stretchy knit does make this a little more unstable if you were to use them on hills. Without the insole its easy for your toes to slide to the side and its so stretchy the shoe will kind of roll underneath your goot even when laced nice. I imagine thats less likely to happen with the insoles since they cup your feet but those are flat by the toes so perhaps not. Either way, I'm mainly using them for disc golf and daily wear. I'll use something else when I'm hiking and the like so it isn't an issue for me.",2

I bought a 14 and they are a little snug, so sadly I need to send them back. However, when I opened the package I was pleasantly surprised. They come in a box, not just some little poly bag. And the build quality looks every bit as good as any big name brand shoe. The material quality is excellent, and the design is phenomenal. They would be great for exercise, but I would wear them for every day wear too. So sad they don't have a 15.",

These are good shoes. I will say that I think they look more shoe like in the product page. When I got them, I though they looked more water shoe like, than running shoe or trainer. They are comfortable and look better than some of my other minimalist shoes do. They're super light weight, and super flexible. I imagine they would be very breathable too. I wouldn't go for a hike in them, but for just about anything else, I think they'd be fine. My only real gripe about them is the front or top of the sock part. It's a bit stiff and comes up a little to high. It would rub right above my no-show socks. Other than that, I really like them.",2

The wide-toe box feels amazing, it's like my feet are finally free after years of being cramped in traditional sneakers. The zero-drop design has made a noticeable difference in my posture and balance, especially during workouts.  Plus, they're incredibly lightweight and flexible, which I love. The only thing I'd mention is that if you're used to heavily cushioned shoes, it might take a little time to adjust to the minimal feel. But trust me, once you do, you won't look back. These shoes have become my go-to for any activity where I want to feel grounded and connected to the ground.",2
