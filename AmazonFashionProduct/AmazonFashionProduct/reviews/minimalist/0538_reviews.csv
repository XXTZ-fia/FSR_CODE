Stone,Didn't match description,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20OKOR2LGPHM6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQHKLHP,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 16, 2024","Size: 40cm/15.7""",Verified Purchase,"This was much shorter than described and went on like a choker instead of having any length. The paperclip look was a perfect size and the material looked good, but I returned it because of the length not matching the description.",2
Misty Frogg,Meh,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6EQX7TMD0UT7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQHKLHP,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 2, 2024","Size: 50cm/19.7""",,I don’t really care for this chain. I mean it’s OK. It’s pretty basic. It can get caught in really hard to catch it but I’m just not very excited about this chain. It’s basic quality nothing exciting.,
Dtim,Stylish and High Quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22I4OXZKFDKU7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQHKLHP,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 31, 2024","Size: 50cm/19.7""",,"This necklace is absolutely stunning! The bold, chunky design adds a perfect touch to any outfit, while still maintaining a minimalist style. I love that it’s made of titanium, so it’s lightweight, durable, and never tarnishes. The short length is great for layering or wearing on its own. A beautiful and timeless piece, highly recommend!",
M. Hamilton,Heavy weight,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WVYZ25C79H7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQHKLHP,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 22, 2024","Size: 50cm/19.7""",,This is a heavy weight. So a good every day work horse kind of piece. It's lovely. A good fashion length.,
Lawrence O.,A good chain for gifting or for yourself,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GK3D5J2118T9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQHKLHP,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 21, 2024","Size: 50cm/19.7""",,"This chain has a good overall look and style.  It would be good as a gift or to add to your own wardrobe as another option.  It has a simple classic look, not too large or too much.  I haven't had it too long yet, so can't speak as to durability, but I didn't find any problems with the make or quality.",
Rachel S,Paperclip necklace,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QDQE8OZY2DJR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQHKLHP,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 15, 2024","Size: 50cm/19.7""",,"It’s just an ok necklace for me. I don’t love the brassy gold color. In some places it looks already tarnished. Im not sure what on it is actually titanium because, while it’s a little hefty, it sounds hollow and cheap. It looks ok stacked with other necklaces, just not my favorite and I feel it’s way overpriced for the quality.",
Customer Review,Heavy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12HFAZPNZ2N8T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQHKLHP,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 15, 2024","Size: 50cm/19.7""",,"This is a really nice chain necklace.  Immediately I felt it was heavy, which usually means its good quality and good metals are used.  I really like the length of the necklace as its 15.7"" and below the collarbone, however there is no extension so only once length to clasp it.  This is supposed to be tarnish-free so we will see.  I'll edit this review after wearing it a few times.",
S. Honeycutt,Brassy finish,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ89SWXS8MIR7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQHKLHP,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 11, 2024","Size: 50cm/19.7""",,"I like the bigger, chunkier style of this paperclip necklace and will wear it because of that. It has some weight to it.  However, the finish looks much more like brass than a gold tone, which is not what I wanted. I thought about taking off two stars for that because it's not a small detail, but the necklace is otherwise a nice piece.",
Amazon Customer,Incredibly high quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14UL7G6QC1A6S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQHKLHP,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 10, 2024","Size: 50cm/19.7""",,"This necklace is amazing. It's got great weight to it, so it sits really nicely on your neck. I wear it in a stack with 3 other necklaces but it also looks great on its own. I think it's great for casual wear, but you could also dress it up. Great for gifting.",
sjcian,Paperclip necklace,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SU8Y7FFEOTMG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQHKLHP,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 10, 2024","Size: 50cm/19.7""",,Love this necklace.  It is the perfect length for me and I like layering it with other necklaces.  Have worn a few times now and shows no signs of tarnishing or wear.  Hoping it stays this way.  The necklace is lightweight and I forget that I have it on most days.,
remoteControlledCow,Not well polished with rough surfaces,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RVEHW3TK05SA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQHKLHP,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 24, 2024","Size: 50cm/19.7""",,"The necklace looks nice at a glance but even a cursory inspection shows it has some flaws.  The gold plating color looks like polished bronze and not gold.  I have a real gold necklace so I took a picture of it next to each other so you can see the difference in tone.  Also, inside of each link isn't smooth/polished but rough which doesn't look great.  Depending on the lighting, the rough texture is very noticeable.  It's pretty easy to shorten the necklace if you want though because end of each link is open - you can just bend open the link to take the pieces out.  I'm not sure if Titanium is suppose to be this easy to bend and separate.  But it's not the bronze color or the link material - main disappointment for me was that the links weren't smooth inside/out.",2
RoZ,Great quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R388J29ILDV12Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQHKLHP,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 28, 2024","Size: 50cm/19.7""",Verified Purchase,Love this necklace. Quality looks pretty close to the design of Cartier that a friend had that inspired me to purchase this one. Nice an chunky size. Not delicate. Just perfect!,4
Amazon Customer,Super cute necklace,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDOPU341NXPB0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJQHKLHP,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 26, 2024","Size: 50cm/19.7""",Verified Purchase,Love this necklace!

It's simple and elegant, and the 7-mm size is just right for a career person like me to wear at work.  It feels like a real gold necklace, not too light, and not too heavy, either. It is 18K gold plated over titanium.  I highly recommend this item.",5
