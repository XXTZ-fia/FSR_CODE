Upon my initial attempt to set the date window the entire stem pulled out of the watch.  The instructions said to pull the stem out to the first stop to set the time and this worked, but the stem would not pull out to a second position as shown in the instructions, to set the date.  When I increased pressure to achieve the 2nd position the entire stem came out of the watch.",8
Todd D. Oesterreich,"Good looking watch, excellent value, slim LOOKING",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R99QNOBHYROIP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08GSH6YZ8,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 20, 2020",,Verified Purchase,"I docked it one star because the watch is not actually slim, it actually appears slim because the back plate is tapered inward, so you only notice the thin top plate unless you are looking REAL close. In summary, it is not a slim watch as claimed, but it does APPEAR to be slim. Edit: It quit working after a little more than 2 years. Rplaced the battery after about 1 year, then replaced it again after about another year. The watch quit working 2 months after the second battery change, figured maybe a bad battery, replaced the battery a third time, the watch still didn't work. NOT taking a star away from the rating for that, for $30 what do you expect.",3
