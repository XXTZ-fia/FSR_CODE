I normally buy 11 or 11.5 (44 or 45). I ordered the 11, as there was no half size option. They sent me a 45. Right out of the box fits well and is very comfortable.  At just under $50, I figured these would be a cheap temporary summertime barefoot shoe while I figure out something better. Right out of the box they are more comfortable and better toe box than my $200+ Lems. They're like a classic Vans with more toe room and a more barefoot feeling sole, which is exactly what I was hoping for. _ Pros: Lower end of the price range for a barefoot shoe. Comfortable right out of the box before even breaking them in. Good room in the toe box without looking like clown shoes. Super light weight, flexible, and very good ground feel. Breathable, like you're barely wearing a shoe. They dry quick. Good grip on the sole, even in wet conditions. Seems like the sole may end up holding up better than the other barefoot shoes I mentioned. They look nice, like a classic Vans vibe. _ Cons: The canvas is not at all water resistant, even walking thru damp grass my socks got wet (I may try waterproofing or waxing them) The tongue is pretty short, it would be better if it was a bit more substantial. The rubber stinks, but hopefully this will fade. The insoles seem pretty flimsy, I may end up swapping them out. _ Neutral: The laces are suuuper long. This could be a pro or a con, but I have to wrap the laces around the ankle so that the excess doesn't hang down to the ground, even with double knots. _ Overall, they seem pretty decent and quite comfortable super minimal barefoot shoe for warm dry weather. We'll see how long they last. If they end up being durable I am considering buying a second pair.",19

As it stands, the rear grommet is closed off by the foam/fabric liner so I don't expect it will be doing much venting, meaning that only one grommet can actually serve as ventilation right now.
