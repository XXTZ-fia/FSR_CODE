Love the price point for the quality, and so far are nicely water resistant. Only complaint is that they make a lot of noise - not squeaking really but like the faux leather rubbing together sound. Surprisingly loud. Otherwise, good shoe.",

They are quite wide (which they advertise, so I'm not holding that against them).  I've never actually seen a child with feet that wide before.  They are easy to put on and they do look kind of cool.  With that said, as they are barefoot shoes, they don't provide much support, and the material is kind of odd.  I don't really have anything concretely negative to say about them. They are just odd in multiple ways and while I can see them being good for kids running around outside with their friends, I'd never send my kid to school in them or really take them anywhere away from home wearing them.",

He says they're super comfortable to wear, and I appreciate that they have Velcro closures that make them easy to put on and take off himself. As for sizing, he's got wider than average feet, and these accommodate his foot shape nicely. They do seem to run a bit big, though, but I mean he'll grow into them. These shoes seem to be made well, too, and look good on. The dark gray goes with most anything, and I know he'll be getting a lot of wear out of them. Nice shoes!",

Perfectly average foot other than a high instep. So trying to find a shoe that the top of her foot fits into but isn’t too big or wide for her feels impossible. These shoes however are PERFECT.

He had to go shoeless for so long because his feet are so different than the average toddler feet. I was really excited to come across a shoe that was made for these special little people! First off, I will admit these shoes are not the most attractive shoes ever, but when you are in our situation, you really are excited to finally find a shoe that fits and is comfortable for your little person.  These boots have real leather uppers and are soft and flexible. I love the hook and loop straps. Having this kind of strap makes getting the boots on and off a breeze! This type of strap also gives you the ability to tighten the shoe to a comfortable level. I will say to be aware that I ordered a 7, but when they came they were a lot bigger than all his other size 7's. We are going to keep them though, as our guy just turned two and is in a growth spurt. Most likely by the time he needs these boots this winter they will be close to fitting. I would just say they run pretty big.  All in all his Mom was very happy with the versatility and quality of these boots. Perfect for our wonderful little person with extra special feet!",6
