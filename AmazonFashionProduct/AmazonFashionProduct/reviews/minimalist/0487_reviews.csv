I’ve had surgery three times on the top part of my foot and I’ve had plantar fasciitis in the past so needless to say finding shoes that are comfortable all day at work is impossible so I wear Javianna flip-flops year-round but the weather is getting cold. The doctor keeps telling me that I need to wear shoes but my feet hate shoes. They just hate them. So I purchased these and receive them and I almost returned them because they’re not very attractive, but I walked in my house in them and they feel like I’m wearing flip-flops, but with a little bit more support and warmer so today I wore them to work. I’ve been in them all day and my feet feel awesome, which is not normally the case in any other tennis shoe, I can wear for four hours even high-end tennis shoes Four hours is max but these I’ve had all day so my review is on comfort. They are excellent if you have problem feet I hope this helps.",

I first used the cushiony sandals. I loved bouncing around in them as it signaled to me that I could walk as much as I wanted.  But eventually they would get too big and a little dangerous on stairs, so I decided to upgrade to Nike running shoes for hard surfaces.  Loved these Lucy shoes.  But I realized I was only fine if I never walked barefoot.  This was not practical and hobbling out of bed in the morning was not cool.  So, I tried these barefoot shows along with a regime of pedicures, Ceraphil, and vitamin C.  Now, these are my favorite shoes, and I have happy, healthy feet.One tip… I had to use foot powder in them as I was barefoot in the barefoot shoes.  Surprisingly, after a few times of applying powder, my feet stay dry and odor free!Plus, it’s fun to wear them with maxi skirts for the ultimate essentric and comfort So I don’t care look.So, I am really happy with these shoes.

These are accurate to American sizing and actually run a bit large by euro standards (11.5 is actually more like a 45 instead of 44). 11.5 turns out to be exactly 28cm of inside foot space, which is 2 cm too many for my feet.

These shoes fit the bill. Extremely skid-resistant. Comfy fit because they allow my feet to rest naturally without being cramped or formed into an unnatural shape. I love the elastic ties…pull them to fit, slide the retainer clip down to lock it to fit. Except when I put on the first shoe, the clip flew off. I couldn’t figure how to reattach it so I tied the laces and got the same affect. No problem with the second shoe. I figured it wasn’t a big enough deal to send them back. I have limited range in one hip and have to use a shoe horn to put the shoe on and the back of the shoe works great for that. I haven’t had any problems with them so far (more than a week) and the zero drop sole plus the wider toe box makes my feet and legs feel like I’m barefoot, and also helps my hip line up better than regular shoes. I’m very happy with them. Just be sure to understand the bottoms are VERY slip resistant. I have barked them several times but that may be because they’re very new.
