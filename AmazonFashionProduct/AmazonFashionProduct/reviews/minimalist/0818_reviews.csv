Pros: - holds a fair amount of cards - carbon fiber design is very nice looking - well constructed - push-button pop-up works well to access cards - pockets for outer cards makes your most used cards easily accessible - elastic band is slimmer than the metal clip version  Cons: - no bill fold; must use the elastic band to hold minimal amount of cash - magnet holding the flap down could be a bit stronger; it’s just ok  Bottom line: get it!",

It's sturdier than most wallets I've owned. Especially for a slim wallet. At first I didn't like it because it was heavy. But now after really looking at it. I like the price for what you get. I think I'll grow into it. But it holds about 12 cards total. And there's a clip for cash. Your cards can be protected by the case (I'm guessing the RFID). In my opinion, it does everything I want it to for $39. It looks good with the carbon fiber fabric, it's made well with what seems to be good quality. I like the plastic money clip, but I thought I was getting the small pocket for cash. I don't like the idea of having my cash ""secured"" by a plastic piece. That's just me.",

Couple of things to mention - The description alternates between talking about a money clip or an elastic strap to hold cash and receipts. I was hoping it would be a money clip, but I got the band. After using it, I think that the money clip would have been kind of a pain getting in and out of my pocket, so glad it worked out, BUT, if you really want the clip, you may want to look for something that’s a bit more specific. The other thing is that I ordered black, but I got brown. Didn’t really care enough to exchange it, but again, just be aware.",

It arrived this morning as Amazon said it would. Same thing elastic band instead of money clip as showed in video. ( This one was cost more.) I looked trying to find where to verify that I would get a money clip. No where did I have a choice. I'm not taking chance on the other color they had. So as much as I like it.
