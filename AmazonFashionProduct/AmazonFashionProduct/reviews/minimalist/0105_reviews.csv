Tanner,WHITIN Toddler/Little/Big/Kid Wide Baref,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TV3YDX24WO9S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8T8PB6T,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: 9 Wide ToddlerColor: W81k | Grey Gum,Verified Purchase,"★★★★★ These ""Barefoot"" Shoes Will Make Your Kids' Feet (and You) Happy!  Listen up, fellow parents! If you've ever watched your kiddo naturally splay their toes while walking barefoot and thought, ""Why can't shoes just... let feet be feet?"" - well, these WHITIN shoes are about to rock your world!  Picture this: A shoe that actually follows the natural shape of a child's foot (shocking, I know!). None of that pointy-toe nonsense that makes you wonder if shoe designers have ever actually seen a human foot. These bad boys are wide in the toe box, letting those little piggies spread out like nature intended!  The Best Parts: - Zero-drop sole (that's fancy talk for ""flat like bare feet"") - Wide toe box that lets toes actually DO their job - Flexible enough to roll up (try that with traditional kids' shoes!) - Lightweight design that won't make your kid stomp around like a tiny astronaut - Actually affordable compared to other ""natural"" footwear options  Now, fair warning: If your kids have been wearing traditional shoes, these might look a bit... different. Your mother-in-law might ask if you forgot to buy ""real shoes."" But trust me, watching your child's feet strengthen naturally and seeing them move with better balance? Worth every raised eyebrow at the playground!  Pro Tip: Order your regular size, but don't freak out about the width - that extra toe space is intentional! It's not a manufacturing error, it's actually the whole point!  Bottom Line: These shoes are like a permission slip for your kid's feet to do what they were designed to do. Plus, they're durable enough to survive playground adventures and easy enough to clean that you won't cry when they inevitably step in a puddle.  For the price point, these are a fantastic introduction to minimalist footwear for growing feet. Your kids' toes will thank you, your wallet won't hate you, and you get to feel like that cool, informed parent who knows about natural movement development. Win-win-win!  (Just be prepared - your kids might never want to go back to ""normal"" shoes again. Don't say I didn't warn you! 😉)",

They slip on quite easily over his brace, and there's enough velcro on the straps to accommodate it as well.

Using their size guide we actually got shoes that fit the first time around! If you’ve ever bought shoes online before, especially for kids AND considering European sizes, that’s a small miracle.  We mostly wear them barefoot (without socks), I had a small period of adjusting my outside toe to that as expected (photographed) but now I can with ease, and if I choose a low sock the fit/wear is just as pleasant, no sliding down on the back of heel, there’s actually small cushions on the inside of the shoe I tried to picture. They’re so comfortable. I never tie or untie these, I slide on and off each wear, the sock fit is a very nice feature for me here. I included photos comparing to crocs, vivos, and hey dudes but those all have pretty wide toe boxes.  My girls, ages 5&2 loved them from the get—sparkly and beautiful, and not in a ‘in your face pink glitter for a girl’ color, they can go with or without socks (never experiencing a blister) AND they can take them on and off without help. Which holds a lot of weight for most moms.  Speaking of weight, they’re very light. They don’t feel blocky or sound like my kids are having a hard time wearing them, even with the wider toe box which is my favorite part and is likely why the fit is so comfortable for all of us. Most US made adult tennis shoes have tight toe boxes where these do not, without compromising look/style. I love the tannish beige, I accepted they wouldn’t stay ‘clean’ forever but I don’t regret my choice. They match with everything and I can wear them with every kind of bottom except skinny jeans as I just personally don’t like the look of tight jeans with a tennis shoe but I’ll wear leggings, sweats, joggers and shorts with them.  Lastly, Kids’ tend to show the quality of a shoe/brand pretty quickly. These have held up well as being our main shoe since summer 2024—parks, outside play, coaching volleyball and still nice enough for church. Current (Dec 2024) photos showing wear included.",

Jamie,Nice shoe but would like verification on material safety,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R506UHW2BF4WU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8T8PB6T,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 6, 2024",Size: 13 Wide Little KidColor: W81k | Black Brown,,"I ordered a size 1 youth shoe & compared it to my niece’s old pair of See Kai Run (SKR) size 1 shoes in the picture. Review of pros- seems well made (aside from Velcro complaints), nice flexible grippy sole (more flexible than Ten Little & SKR), foot shaped (SKR is not & SKR toe box becomes more narrow as the sizes increase), & wider toe box compared to Ten Little & SKR. I like was really hesitant to order kids Whitin shoes bc they are from a 3rd party overseas seller than may not conform to material safety standards enforced on shoes bands sold in the US (regardless of where the shoe is made). I am primarily worried about lead and phthalates which could be in the paint on the metal buckle slot, vinyl size label on inner tongue & “Whitin” written on insole, the rubber reinforced toe, and the rubber outer sole. I would be much more likely to buy these shoes again if the company would at least verify that these shoes are lead free. They also are a bit expensive IMO. I went with the color combo bc it was on sale for half price. $37-40 seems a bit high to me considering that their adult shoe line is about the same price. Even though I really like the shoes, I’m not sure if I would buy these again UNLESS the company verifies the safety of the materials. If I was paying full price, I’d be more likely to opt for Splay or Ten Little even though I like the design of these a better (Splay is not quite as durable and Ten Little isn’t nearly as flexible). I washed these shoes in the washer in attempt to remove potential chemical residue. I put each shoe in a mesh bag and the insoles in a separate mesh bag. Sizing - the insole size was almost identical to the See Kai Run size 1 length but it was wider. The white SKR insole is actually more narrow than it looks when laying against the blue Whitin insole bc the taper of the SKR toe box forces the insole to flex upwards on the sides. The Whitin insole is able to lay flat in the shoe. When I measured the Whitin insole, it was 8 1/8 (compared to the Amazon listing of 8 1/4 inches) BUT if you take into account the lip on the heel (SKR has this too) then it’s a bit less than 8 inches. Also, I felt like the SKR leather shoes ran smaller than other brands of size 1 sneakers that my niece wore. I think you’re safest ordering a size up for Whitins, especially if you plan to use the insoles. Ideally measure your child’s feet with socks on near the end of the day (feet tend to swell and can be bigger by the end of the day). Make sure to measure both feet bc most people have one bigger foot. Always order based on the bigger foot. I saw another reviewer posted a picture of SKR and Whitin compared in length but they did not compare the length of the insoles. I think that SKR has a thicker rubber strip going around the outside of the shoe that makes it look longer. The insoles are important to consider because they dictate how much space your foot has inside of the shoe.",
