Many of the shoes these days squeeze your toes into the end of the shoe in an unnatural position causing toe discomfort. I purchased these because I like the idea of a minimalist shoe and the way it solved the issue with a wide toe box. I have worn these in my driveway while I'm working on vehicles,  shopping with my wife, and hiking on the trails while camping.  They are very durable as you can see from the pictures. They are over 3 years old now so I bought another pair. (Old shoe and new shoe in the pictures) You can see how much of the tread I have worn down and how well the shoes still look. I believe these are a great value for your money. I don't write many reviews but I wanted to share my experience because these are a clear winner!",

Today I wore them for the first time and after widening up the laces a bit, I'm pleasantly surprised at how comfortable these are - like walking on a cloud! Surprisingly these feel fantastic on my feet, unlike Vibram's Five Fingers that I tried to wear many years ago. I've been wearing Skechers wide width for almost 2 years and my feet have naturally started to adjust to a wide fit. When I wear regular sneakers now they are just too tight! So getting into these Whitin barefoot shoes was a natural transition. I was expecting to break these in over time, as some have suggested, but I have very little to no pain. For the price, these are of amazing quality. I appreciate the wide toe box promoting a natural gait. These are also perfect for weightlifting at the gym! I love how I'm building strength in my feet, ankles, and legs. I also am starting to enjoy the feeling of different textures depending on the floor, whether that be concrete, pavement, or trail.

No pain and no blisters (granted I am already use to barefoot shoes).  I'm a size 10.5 shoe and size 11 fit great in these. They are very light and breathable, great for a summer shoe.

I can confidently say that I’ve finally found it. These barefoot shoes are nothing short of revolutionary.  From the moment I slipped them on, I was hooked. Indoors, they feel like walking on clouds. It's as if I'm barefoot, but with the added benefit of protection. The sensation is pure bliss. But don't be fooled by their delicate feel – these shoes are built for adventure. I've taken them on hikes that would put many dedicated hiking boots to shame, and they've exceeded all expectations. The grip is incredible, providing ample traction on uneven terrain. And while they offer minimal cushioning, it's the perfect amount. The soft rubber sole allows you to feel the ground beneath your feet, providing a unique sensory experience that’s both invigorating and grounding.  One of the most surprising benefits is the foot massage-like sensation I get when walking on rocky surfaces. It's like nature's own reflexology treatment! The rocks provide gentle pressure points, relieving tension and invigorating my feet. It's an odd thing to say, but I actually look forward to walking on rocky trails just for this reason.  I was so impressed that I ended up buying five different colors! I simply can't get enough of these shoes. If you're tired of sacrificing comfort for style or performance, look no further. These barefoot shoes are the perfect blend of all three. Trust me, your feet will thank you.",2

I have one pair that I use for everything yard, washing vehicles, etc. I have had them for about a year and they are pretty much destroyed but still going. I have the third pair for out and about and hiking. They slip on easily and wrap the foot nicely. Hiking long distances, greater than 4 miles, may warrant a more supportive shoe, but these are great for shorter excursions. It's nice to feel every contour of the ground which allows for a more engaged experience. The rubber is perfect for outdoors but can get a little slick inside if there is water on the floor.

While my left foot fits fine, my right foot feels a bit tight, with my toes almost touching the edge, especially when using the insole.

Aaron P.,Very pleased - just what I was looking for,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GPBCQ5WNI9L1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DRV6VWTJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 2, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"WHITIN Men's Minimalist Trail Runner - GreenI've worn size 9.5 in Merrell's for 20 years so I wasn't sure what size to get in these.  I went with 9 and they fit perfect.  10 would definitely have been too big.  These seem well made and the draw string lace tightens down nicely.  Padding around the ankle and top of foot is good.  I've worked out in these a few times and road a Rogue Echo bike and they felt great.  I'm leaving the insert in for now and don't see any need to take it out.  Hopefully they last, but for now they are great.",4
