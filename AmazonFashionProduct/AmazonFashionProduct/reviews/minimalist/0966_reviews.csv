It looks very stylish that way. Lightweight, good color. Good value for occasional wear. I don’t think they are durable enough or high quality like gold to wear everyday.",

But after a bad breakup I entered my “Golden Goddess” era where I just wanted to drip in gold colored jewelry. Now loving a bolder look I couldn’t find many cuffs that I liked but hubba, hubba, when I saw this cuff all I could say was “Come to mama!” It did not disappoint. I bought a bold gold ring that I felt paired well with it and now my arm story says “Yup, I’m glorious and I feel it!” Basically, it just made me feel put together, stylish and pretty which in turn made me feel confident. Absolutely love , love!💕",

The ""colonial gold"" hammered style and craft is very well done. The design is contemporary and chic. I wish that this comes in real gold because it is a beautiful bracelet.  Remember to store it separate and the bag that comes with it, so it will last longer.  Also, I'm supper allergic to everything and I had not issues with the bracelet... no green, no rash, no red.",

This cuff really classes up a casual outfit without looking pretentious. It's plated gold so avoid getting it wet. It will be interesting to see how long it lasts without peeling. At this point I've had it about a month, minimal wear, and it seems to be holding steady.  I like that the design is open which allows for it to be adjustable. All the same, it's obviously designed for a small to average wrist size. The hammered element is what attracted me to this cuff along with the affordability.  It came nicely packaged with a soft pouch and is totally giftable.",

While it does fit, it will not stay on because the opening is too wide. The metal also has a bump that caught on my tshirt as soon as I tried it on. I can't say I would order this again.",

It's astonishingly light! It comes with a nice storage bag that says ""Love Is Eternal"" so it makes for a nice gift.  My wife likes it and has tried in on with different sweaters. It does expand or contract fairly easily as needed, and seems solid enough that it will last a long time.  For costume jewelry, it's well-made and can be used for everyday wear. I think it's a decent value for the price.",
FrankieDoll,Love This Bracelet!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PE06D66ZRFA1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHHGG725,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 10, 2023",Color: Style 6 - Gold,,"I love the look of Hammered Jewelry and knew I would love this 14k Gold-Plated Adjustable Bracelet from KissYan. I have a smaller wrist and usually wear a 7"" bracelet. This bracelet, out of the box was a little big, but it easily squeezes in to a smaller size and fits perfectly. Remember to squeeze it gently, so as not to break or deform it. It was hard to choose from all the pretty cuff bracelets, but I finally chose this one and I am so happy with it! Since it has a long, rectangular cut-out through the center of the bracelet, so when it's on, it looks like 2 bracelets! I got 2 bracelets for the price of one, which is how I see it, lol! Plus, it has the look of 2 bracelets without all that usual jangling noise of 2 bracelets worn together that can drive you a bit crazy by the end of the evening, lol! As this is gold-plated, I know the gold color will eventually fade, so I am keeping it stored away and clean when I'm not wearing it. I have worn it to work, to lunch, to a party.. it's a very versatile piece in my jewelry wardrobe now. Great price, classy bracelet. I would buy this again. I hope my review is helpful for you!",

SleepyLark,A very beautiful piece of jewelry,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBBS7O7SXYVTC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHHGG725,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2023",Color: Style 6 - Gold,,"I received this in a pretty pouch which is convenient for storing it. A beautiful bracelet. It has a hammered finish, something to which I am partial. I wish they had staggered the pieces used to make the 2 parts of it since I can see similarities in the hammering on the 2 parts of the bracelet. But I looked at it closely and people who see it on my wrist won't, so that does not really matter. I needed to tighten it slightly on my wrist. I can wear it comfortably and then tighten it. The finish is beautiful. It looks expensive and I can think of any number of different occasions I can wear it. This will be a much used part of my wardrobe. I especially like that it is gold plated on brass. Even if, in the far future, the gold rubs off and the brass comes through, it sill be less visible than if it was steel or silver under the gold plating.",

The bracelet has a high polish gold color finish and according to the web description is 14k over brass. There are no metal stamps visible, but there usually isn't on gold plated items. It is adjustable but does require some force. The finish stayed nice and solid when adjusting it and there was no cracking or craze lines in the plating.  I have a fairly small wrist (6in) and was able to adjust it where it fit loosely and securely. The uneven design is nice and modern kind of like a wave. Overall, really like this and happy I ordered it.",
Laureisen,I Love This Cuff!!!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BIQ28DUYB87B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHHGG725,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 23, 2023",Color: Style 6 - Gold,,"What do I love about this cuff? Everything! When I saw its picture I was immediately drawn to it and when I saw it was plated with 14k gold I had to see it. It’s perfect. I don’t wear much gold jewelry but when I do I don’t have any cuffs that I just adore. Now I do! The gold plating looks as real as I could have hoped, a rich and buttery yellow. I’m very picky about my jewelry and if the color is off, forget it.  The hammered texture reflects the light beautifully. I’m so picky that I noticed the two separated bands have the same texture as each other. That’s the only thing I would change. You can see that there are indentations in the same places on both bands. Of course what I am suggesting is the difference between a designer and a mass produced hammered cuff. Believe me it won’t matter one bit in a few minutes!  I have a small wrist, a 6.25” one and I was able to gently squeeze the piece to fit. It’s probably even easier to open it to enlarge it. I can only say that this particular piece checks all my boxes and I am thrilled I found it here.",2
