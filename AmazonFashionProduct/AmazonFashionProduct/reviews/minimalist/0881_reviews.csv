We have another pair of whitins and they are holding up very well to daily use at school and on the playground  (although we got the white ones, and they instantly become dirty to the point of being a hideous brown/gray that doesn't remove despite all my attempts at washing - thus we are trying black ones this time). There is great room for his toes, and they are flexible and comfortable. We tried another hightop pair which was not comfortable around the ankle, and he likes these ones much better. I wish the whole shoe was water resistant (we live in the Pacific Northwest and the ground is like a wet sponge and/or it is raining for many months). They are comfortable with or without the insoles, which is nice for when his feet are a little bigger. We have always done barefoot shoes, and are happy to have found this style barefoot (style is very important for kids). We predict these will be easier to keep clean.",

soupcan,"Great shoe for kids.  Wide toe box, zero top high top",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R283FV3O4XFG4B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9NRT9Q8,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 29, 2024",,,"Great shoes for kids.  I'm a big believer in wide toe box shoes for everyone, and zero drop for most people.  Zero drop means there is no height difference between the heel and the toe.  I had significant issues with plantar fasciitis and shin splints and ended up doing physical therapy and eventually cortisone shots for the plantar.  The physical therapy didn't seem to do much and the cortisone shots lessened the pain but it felt like I was walking on bubble gum.  Lessened what I felt but didn't solve the problem.  For the shin splints I did extensive anterior tibialis work and ankle stretching which did help. Eventually I saw some videos from squat university and learned about wide toe box shoes which let the feet spread out.  Narrow shoes push the big toe in which cuts blood flow off to the muscles on the bottom of the feet.  When that happens, pain.  I went to a wide toe box shoe and within weeks I was feeling better.Heel elevated shoes place the calf in a constantly shortened position.  When you start doing things like running your calf doesn't want to extend all the way, and because it's a bigger muscle, it transfers the stress onto the weaker antagonist muscle, the tibialis anterior (shin).  I want all three of my kids to never have these issues.  These shoes have a wide toe box and are zero drop.  My ideal shoe should be both of these as well as able to fold up into a ball.  This lets the feet muscles get strong because they're protected from rocks and such, but they must adapt to uneven terrain and provide that support.  In addition, they look great.  These are A+ shoes in my book.",4

They’re like a sneaker and chukka boot cross with the coolest confetti sole. The fixed elastic laces make slipping these on and off a breeze and the Velcro strap keeps everything secure. I like the wide toe box which gives my son ample room to wiggle his little piggies. The barefoot design threw me a little, as there is very little between the inner shoe and the sole, but my son said that they’re really comfortable. I ordered these in size 5 hoping for room for growth, but the length of these is more in line with his 4’s. Check the chart and order accordingly; these shoes are cool!",2

They have a very elastic-y fabric upper (that you can spray with waterproofing spray if you want to) that holds its shape really well while still making them a breeze to slide on and off. The elastic laces are built in and totally fuss free--the shoes are ready to go right out of the box. The velcro strap at the top makes putting the shoes on and off really simple, and then it helps secure the shoes on. The boxy toe makes the shoe super comfortable and roomy without being like clown shoes. The shoe is really lightweight, but not flimsy. The sole is nonslip and has a really cool looking confetti vibe that adds a little aesthetic value without being cheesy. The high top look is super stylish. I LOVE these.",
