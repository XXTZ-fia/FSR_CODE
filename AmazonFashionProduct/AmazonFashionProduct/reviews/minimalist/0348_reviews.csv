For me it's really didn't do it. First off it is light as it says and roomy in the toes area and with minor adjustments it does becomes perfect to slip on and off. But that is about it. There is practically no padding on the inside, no cushion, nothing and the soles are quite thin. You'll feel like you are barefoot. Unless you have thick leather for feet, these shoes are much good for most things. I just walk over a mile in these and the walk back I just wanted to take them off. There is no shock absorption, so every step you take, you can feel the shock when you feet comes down. So these are definitely not for hiking and walking in a urban area is pushing it if you are taking a long walk. Short distances like taking out the garbage or checking the mail would be fine and walking on a beach with soft sand. I doubt putting cushion inserts would help. Maybe if they added a layer of vulcanized rubber to help with shock absorption. If you're looking for hiking shoes or just shoes to go walking in, these ain't it. I hope this helps.",

They're not perfect, But they are amazing for what they cost. I know that they are barefoot type shoes but I actually much prefer them when I'm wearing my insole with them. I wear a spenco hard plastic insole provides arch support. Without that, I always felt like my shoes were collapsing into the arch. The other day I stepped on a nail and that hard plastic actually saved me from having a rusty nail go into my foot. These shoes are very thin and made of rubber so they don't provide much protection to stepping on things. But obviously they aren't intended for that.  I do notice that I don't like that the metal buckle that holds the strap taut can turn and move. If I tighten the strap real strong, like I would like to, The metal buckle turns and it doesn't get as tight as I'd like.

I got this for $29 in early Oct 2024. I have used this for well over a dozen walks now. I am definitely enjoying the Velcro.  My 1st walk (all my walks/hikes are 1.5-2 hrs long) was a bit painful. It was pinching the natural-fold under the front-sole of my feet. PERSONAL OPINION: I think ""hiking"" style shoe-soles with ""spikes"" are a BAD idea for such ""barefoot shoes"". These soles for such shoes should be simpler and ""featureless"".  FYI - My feet stink very easily. So, I am required to use Dr. Scholl’s odor-eaters in all of my footwear. I forgot to insert those odor-eaters for my 1st walk. The 2nd time I wore these sneakers, I put in these odor-eaters. That made the difference - re: any pain. With colder temperatures now, with Costco's woolen-socks, there's even more comfort.  By the 4th walk, I think the ""spikes"" of the Sole got worn out and it was somewhat comparable to the reasonable brand-name like ""Whitin"", which sells for around $44. Also, there is a tiny stitching-deviation on the right sneaker, that causes the metal-hook for the Velcro to turn 90° and make a mess of the velcro (but, there's a simple & reversible easy fix that you need to do everytime).  The last “evaluation factor” is to wash these barefoot-sneakers. The ""Whitin"" brand was meant to be washed; So, I will soon find out if these will withstand a simple wash in a bucket. I get paid well to afford the extra $15 to buy Whitins the next time around - independent of whether these are truly REPEATEDLY washable.",
