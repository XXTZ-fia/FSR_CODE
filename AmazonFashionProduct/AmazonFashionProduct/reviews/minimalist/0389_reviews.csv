I bought them for indoor-only shoes, but they're sturdy enough I'll be buying more for outdoor use. I like them better than the Whitin and Xero shoes, which aren't as cute, and don't fit my foot as proportionally well. They are affordable enough that I can recommend them to my patients who need zero drop shoes w/ a wider toe box. I will say that their soles aren't nearly as thin or flexible as I'm used to, so I'll have to see if I end up heel-striking out of habit in them. I'm still 100% happy with my purchase.",

Blisters, on my pinky toes, are the deal breaker.  My feet are 10.5in from heal to toe, and 4.3in wide. Ordered men's 9.5 because 8.5 and 9 are NEVER wide enough. Shoe length was acceptable, not too long.  Wore these indoors for 5 hours around the house to test. Quality is poor to middling. Material is very thin, which is great for barefoot style shoes, but I don't think they will last. I appreciate the flatness, zero arch, and zero drop.  Size is too narrow because of poor stitch design which rubs against the pinky toes, even in the wide toe box. It would be acceptable if not for feeling like sandpaper was abrading my toe. It's only the toe box which is ""wide,"" so the rest of the shoe is more narrow; but honestly, it felt fine and snug, but not *too* tight.  I'd probably keep these, since they were cheap, if not for the poor stitching placement and quality that is giving me a blister on my pinky toe after just 5 hours of lounging around the house.  I do have some 'moleskin' padding, to stick over that stitching area, that I may try tomorrow before returning the shoes.",

All the walking and running around we did in all sorts of terrain and environments and these shoes held up splendidly! Walking around in them all day never hurt my feet! There is plenty of room for all of your toes which makes walking so pleasant, and I swear even my balance is better since I am able to use my whole foot and the sole is thin enough that you can get a sense of what the ground is like beneath your foot which helps (but the sole is also thick enough that it's not going to hurt if you step on a rock or something).

Perfect for light walking or for wearing indoors. They’re comfortable and thick enough for that.  That said, if you’re not someone used to running barefoot definitely don’t run outside on pavement with these. I made that mistake chasing a dog and my bones hurt. :)  If you’ve got Achilles tendinitis I also would not recommend these for extended periods of time. If just for indoors where you’d otherwise would be barefoot then these are ok for that too since there is a little less strain on the tendon than with being fully barefoot.

I’ve worn them daily for a few months now. The wide toe box and zero drop is better than other similar shoes. They are lightweight and the rubber sole is thin, durable, and has excellent grip. I’m only giving 4 stars because of the color options and the memory foam insoles. The insoles, imo, are terrible. They give me a “floating” feeling that throws off my balance. Also, the material used for the top of the insoles has no grip and feels slippery to my feet. I’m not sure why others haven’t mentioned this. Taking them out alleviates that, but the footbed under the insole is not meant to be used without an insole. Wearing them like that for just a couple days builds up lent balls that are uncomfortable and feel like little pieces of gravel stuck inside your shoes. I haven’t yet been able to find insoles that fit these shoes and suit my fancy. So other than the terrible insoles and color options, these are an excellent affordable option of barefoot shoes.",

At first I was very skeptical about them but for the price I figured they were worth the shot. These shoes are great.  FIT: These shoes fit my extra wide feet perfectly. The actual shoe size is spot on and the wide toe box is no joke. There is ample room for my toes with absolutely zero toe scrunching. Also the low cut tops are great for not digging into my swollen ankles and lower legs.  COMFORT: These barefoot shoes are super comfortable. They feel like walking around barefooted but your feet are still protected. They are very breathable so that your feet don't sweat and the soles are super grippy making me feel secure on all surfaces .  CONSTRUCTION: All of the materials that these shoes are made from seems to be very durable. I have been wearing these shoes every day with no issues. The stitching has held up just fine with no frays or torn stitches. The fabric is super durable with no holes or tears and there has been no sole separation.  All in all these shoes are great. I have bought another pair for myself and my mom even got a pair to wear to work and she loves them. I would highly recommend these barefoot shoes to anyone.,5

Not only is there room side to side but the fabric the top of the shoe is made from has elasticity to it, allowing for room top to bottom while not feeling loose or shifting while you walk. The shoe is a zero drop variety meaning there is no heel elevation like in many shoes. This is a healthy thing for feet but can take getting used to if you wear heels often. There is no arch support. The sole is soft and comfortable but thin. When walking over rocks, you can feel the uneven surface. I wear these at work and they are perfect for that but I have a mix of sitting and standing. I think you would need something with more support and padding if you had to stand or walk in these for 8 hrs. The black color goes well with all the pants I wear to work.

I tend to keep my shoes laced a bit loose since I like them to be comfortable and these laces are a bit too short for that, so I skip the last hole to still be able to easily tie them.  Style is nice and simple - some reviews have mentioned a bit of a ""clown shoes"" look and the toe area does flare out slightly more than usual, but I don't notice it once I'm actually wearing them.

I think they are good for lifts, like squat, when you don't want a heel drop; or casual shoes for short errands.

The comfort is there too - I've probably worn them for a total of 24 hours now, 6 or 7 hours as a time, and they're great! They fit well, stay put and are decent to walk and run in - i would go jogging in them for exercise, but if you need to chase down a basketball or 5 yr old or something like that they're not uncomfortable or hazardous to sprint in. All in all I am pleased, especially given the price point.They looks good, feel great and will look even better with some glow in the dark  (or reflective) laces!",
Aric,Good for the right environments,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD12NFRF5WMLO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKJYC6L9,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 10, 2024",Size: 12.5 Wide Women/11.5 Wide MenColor: Black,,"I have never owned a pair of ""barefoot"" shoes and wanted to give them a try.  When they arrived (in a clear plastic bag), the first thing that struck me was the overall shape. The toe end flares out sharply giving it (as other reviewers have also pointed out), a slight clown shoe vibe. It's subtle, but definitely noticeable. This design allows for plenty of toe-wiggling room and I have found them to be comfortable for around the house and in my studio.  They are minimalistic in style so there is little to comment on there. They fit true to size and you should consider them to be ""wide"" when selecting what size will work best for you.  The other main thing that I noticed right away is the lack of arch support and cushion. This became apparent when I went for my morning walk of about two miles. By the time I was half the distance, my feet were starting to feel sore. I'm not sure if this is the specific shoe or if this is part of what makes it a ""barefoot"" shoe, but I quickly concluded that these shoes were not made for walking (at least not on pavement). So, I'll continue to wear them around the house and in my home studio because they are comfortable in those situations.",

PDR,Really nice lightweight shoes that do not crush your toes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NR1PCPNTX9MF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKJYC6L9,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 9, 2024",,,"I am someone who works out regularly and have several pieces of cardio equipment that I use daily. The main two are my exercise bike and treadmill. I like to use them for a long period of time and often my feet starts to ache after a bit, and my toes get really crushed in my sneakers. So, when it came across these, I thought they sounded really interesting and like they would be a good fit for me, so I went ahead and placed an order for them. When they arrived, I was really eager to use them right away. I was first struck with how lightweight they are. They look like they would be heavier than they actually are. The construction seems pretty well. I don’t know if these would be really well to run in or to put a lot of wear on because where the soles meet the fabric it seems like it could’ve been better constructed, but since I’m using it for my indoor equipment, I think it will be perfect for me. One odd thing was that I ordered them in size 14, and inside the install was a sticker that said 14 but when I peeled it away, it actually was printed 13 on the insole . But, they definitely fit like a size 14, so even though it was a little confusing, they did accurately fit. They do look a little bit funny. The way they are shaped looks almost like an orthopedic shoe to me, but, these are so comfy when using them! The toe part is shaped like your foot is so it gives total freedom and are extremely comfortable, especially for prolonged periods of time. The material is very breathable and super comfy all around. I definitely recommend giving them a try, and even though they may not be the most visibly pleasing, your feet will definitely thank you! They’re also at a great price point and definitely worth it. I hope my review helps you to make a more well informed decision.",4

Thought these might work like sneakers, not not really sure.They are minimalist.  It has a thin rubber like sole, with a mesh like covering over the top.  There is no arch, no padding.  When I put them on they remind me of water shoes, with laces.  If you are someone who hikes with bare feet, these would give your feet some protection from sticks and sharp rocks.  I could also see them very useful if you backpack and want a pair of comfortable shoes to wear around the campsite after taking off your hiking boots.They appear to be well made.  I wear a 10 or 10.5, and these are the right size at 10.5.  The toe area is very roomy.  Tread looks adequate, should give enough grip for most surfaces.  They should serve me well.",

Amazon Customer,Comfortable! Great toe box! Somehow makes your feet look smaller!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GEQQ5Z92E6ZP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKJYC6L9,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 6, 2024",Size: 9.5 Wide Women/8.5 Wide MenColor: Black,,I've been wearing these steadily since they arrived. There was a slight adjustment of a few hours because I had supports in the previous sneakers whereas these are trying to let your feet assume their natural position. I wasn't trying to be funny when I said they make your feet look smaller. It's weird but they really do. They are nicely made. I've even gotten away with wearing them with dress plants.,

At first I was concerned that they looked too small. There was a temporary size tag covering the printed size.  I tried them on, laced the laces and they fit well.  There is some arch in the shoes but the wide toe box, is really cool.  I live it!  I was wearing another pair of more trendy looking shoes and my toes were numb, falling asleep and tingly.  I put these on, and wore them all day. My toes are happy.  They look cool on as well. With jeans and skinny style pants, they are really fun looking.  I'm happy with the order and hope that my foot health is improved. I am not very familiar with barefoot shoes, and all the reasons for the benefits of the body and fitness. I am not sure what makes these shoes 'barefoot' shoes. But, my toes and thanking me.5 stars",
