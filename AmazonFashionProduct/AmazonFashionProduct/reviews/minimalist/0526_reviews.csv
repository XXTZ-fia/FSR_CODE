Now if they were smooth leather they would really have something. Won't return them but won't buy from them again.,

The way the rough edges extend to almost the bottom of the sole on the sides will result in them breaking down fast. The inside is a polyester lined thin foam and will breakdown fast. The soles are thinner than most of my house slippers and are not going to last long on pavement. The soles are very flat with no tread which makes them very slippery.

There are shoelaces, but they stop at the top of the shoe without extra shoelace to tie; a small plastic piece at the top prevents the shoelaces from slipping off. The leather is soft and flexible and the shoe sole is solid. i ordered a size 10½ based on the recommended shoe size (my husband's shoe size), but unfortunately they are small and feel too tight. Therefore i recommend you order a size larger than usual. i definitely give them 5 stars though. i hope this review is helpful. Sabiene :)",2

In fact, the laces are the perfect length— not too short that you need a microscope to tie the knot, nor will you have ribbons to tuck into your shoes.  For the money, they are great errand shoes or if you need to quickly go out and get the mail.  Material is soft and supple and did I mention how comfortable they are?!

He thought that they were comfortable at first and liked the nice shade of brown/tan.  He also ran his fingernail over them and noticed that they didn’t scuff up like some other shoes.He doesn’t normally wear shoes without socks because his toes rub on the top inside of the shoes too much; but he thought these would be okay without socks.  However, after 45-minutes walking around at home, he noticed some discomfort on his right toes and put on socks, which prevented the problem.  The shoes actually come with a pair of gray socks (see photo).  It was nice to include the socks with the shoes; but the color doesn’t match the brown/tan shoes.If you take a look at the bottom of the shoes (see photo), there is a right and left hand on the appropriate shoe.  Kind of cute…but there are also bumps where the knuckles are and those bumps are uncomfortable on the bottoms of his feet after he wears the shoes for a while.  Another problem for him is that the insoles are very thin and have no arch support.  He really needs the arch support.He ordered a half-size larger than he normally wears. His new shoes are long enough but the toe box (front area) is too narrow. Even with thin socks on, the shoes feel a little tight.The seller doesn’t have Wide option for these shoes. They suggest that, if your foot is wide, you choose a size up; conversely, if your foot is slim or standard, you should order the standard size.  My husband usually wears a size 9; but I ordered the half-size larger because the size 9 was not available.  That was fortunate since the 9 would have been too small.Maybe these shoes will feel nice on guys who don’t need the arch and are okay with the raised areas on the soles of the shoes; but I can’t recommend them based on my husband’s experience.",2

It has elastic non-tie laces with unique logos on the ends and it really can slip on and off without using your hands at all. Due to the elastic laces, they grip the foot well, but I wouldn't go kicking or running around too fast with these. Those laces are meant to stay untied and uncinched, and to tighten the shoe you only can pull the elastic laces tighter around their loops.  Overall these shoes are very comfortable and they have a very nice casual appearance to that. They can be worn in any non-athletic sneaker capacity and they can also be worn as casual, or possibly dress, shoes. Despite feeling like suede they are a little more water resistant than I was expecting, and they are actually quite durable when walking long distances. Between the stitching and the various materials used they appear to be high quality and so far I have worn them at least once a week for a couple months now and I have zero complaints. I normally like big boots or at least high top shoes but I wanted to give something simple like this a try and it is definitely a great shoe.",

So he is constantly looking for tennis shoes or something that he can tolerate for countless hours of standing in basically one place. These shoes piqued his interest, and has always been curious how moccasins would fare in that setting. BTW, he said that moccasins are a far better description than hiking shoes for this variety.  Unfortunately, he will need to provide an update for a bit on how these fair for all day wear, as he does not have a convention schedule for some time. But for the few times he's worn them, he's found them to be comfortable enough to bring on his next trip.

I generally wear memory foam sneakers and after a few months the memory foam becomes useless and my feet start hurting. My plantar fascitis doesn't help, either. What does help is the fact that these shoes are almost like walking barefoot. They feel good and my feet feel good.  Even though they are not wide, the suede leather stretches to accommodate my feet. I love the minimalist look, the stitching seems to be good and I love the fact that they are slip-ons. They are very flexible, unlike most shoes I've ever owned, which is another reason they are comfortable.  We'll see how long they last and if they stay as comfortable in time.

Tnek,Zero Drop Euro Design minimalist shoe with narrowish toe box,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CD8WKBZR2O66/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCJHKT1H,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2023",Size: 10.5Color: Apple Green,,"I have been wearing these shoes off and on for a couple of days.  My TLDR is that I like them, but the toe box is a bit narrow and the design is a bit funky.Let's start with the design of the shoe...These look and feel like a European flavor zero drop minimalist shoe.  They have a little too much going on, I would prefer a cleaner looking shoe.  The design element that bothers me the most is the way the sole is sewed to the upper.  If you look at the description pictures, you can see what look sort of like waves where the two meet.  This is cool from the side, but when i look straight down I can see the leather flare out from where they are sewn and it looks weird.  The other design aspect I don't love is the dbeck on the side.  the little ram logo is enough.Those things aside, the leather quality (apple green nubuck leather) is pretty good, the stitching of the shoe is pretty good, and the sole is nice.  As I mentioned, these are essentially zero drop minimalist shoes.  I wear another brand with a wider toe box daily.  I leave their minimalist sole in, so these felt very comfortable to me in terms of cushion and support.  But the narrower toe box is less comfortable.  Not terrible, but not comfortable.  I have walked the dog in these several times, and while not as comfortable as my normal shoe, they are pretty good.Not sure how i feel about the lacing system.  I think I would prefer to have regular laces, but with these they slip on fine.  I can replace the laces at some point if I want.I have walked after a rain, and the strange soles provide adequate grip, even on wet cross walk paint.All in all, if they didn't have the dbeck on the side of them, I would consider a second pair.  They are comfortable and funky/cool.  But I can't quite get past that.  IT's a broader issue I have with all of the brands from China.  They would sell so many more things if they didn't splash a giant brand name on the product.  Subtle is good.",

I'll need to get fancier jeans to wear with them. The soles are very thin so I'd recommend them for walking around town rather than running or hiking. They slip on and are snug without tying the laces. One star off because they are not really a trail shoe as advertised.,
JB,I like these as City Sneakers.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D86M7A5I813F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCJHKT1H,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 21, 2023",Size: 10.5Color: Brown,,"I like these as city sneakers.  The Pics show the wonderful detail that went into making these shoes.  Pic #2 shows the Sole that looks like a Hand Grabbing the foot of the Shoe. When you walk around in them you feel the support on the Side of the Shoe as well as the Bottom.  Pic #3 shows the Insole, note how thick it is and how it raises up on the Sides.  This all works together to make your feet feel Comfortable.  The Shoes are designed to be worn with the Laces snugged but untied around the city.  They can be tied for woodland hiking.  Good Trekking!",

The suede uppers are handsome and supple, the soles are flexible and supportive. They arrive in a witty shoe bag, and each shoe inside is bagged individually as well. They even included a pair of socks! I had a pair very much like them years ago that were such a favorite I wore them to shreds. I am so happy to have another chance to enjoy them.",
Redacted,Disappointing on all counts. Free cotton socks.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VDUKZYET3K7D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCJHKT1H,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 20, 2023",Size: 8.5Color: Brown,,"If there is something redeemable about these shoes I haven't found them yet. They are a huge disappointment. Their toe box is simultaneously too small and too long for the size, the lacing system is poorly conceived, outsole design is a poor performer, side vents are cosmetic, lining retains heat, build quality leaves a lot to be desired, and they weren't made for durability. They do come with free cotton socks so at least it has that going for it.  Design wise these are an oddball. Visually they take cues from minimalist zero drop barefoot shoes but in practice they're much closer to traditional fit shoes. You end up with an amalgam that is a poor example of both approaches.  The shoe itself is zero drop and unsupported like a barefoot shoe. It's the insoles that are propping up the heel and adding support. The construction on the insole is on the low quality side and looks like it would have a limited lifespan. They're also quite thick so they will likely be quite uncomfortable if you have mid to high foot volume even if you do like the added support of the insoles. If you insist on trying to make these shoes work for you, my recommendation would be to pull the insoles and wear them as something that better resembles a barefoot shoe.  Which brings us to my biggest disappointment. The toe box is very poorly designed. It has a very tight isosceles trapezoid shape that poorly takes into account the shape of the toes. The longest point of the shoe is in the center instead of inward to accommodate the big toe. What this does is make a toe box that is very tight but also very long. So the shoes uncomfortably squeeze my toes and I still have a lot of excess space out in front despite carefully examining the size chart. If you still insist on getting these shoes go up a full Euro size (going up or down a US size will likely get you the same size shoe just with a different label on the bag that the shoes come in) possibly even two.  Which brings us to another poor design decision, the laces. The laces are made from shock cord and are terminated with a polymer bead to prevent the laces from coming out of the top eyelet. The shock cord was not cut correctly on the shoes I received but it's a moot point given all the other issues. The shock cord based lacing system is not a bad idea, it makes it handy as a casual/everyday shoe. It essentially turns it into a slip-on which isn't great for athletic pursuits but is quite nice for a house shoe. But like with the rest of the shoe's design, execution was poor. As you can see from the product photos the idea was that you keep the laces loose with beads already right up against the top eyelet. With the ideal being they provide just enough resistance to stay on but not enough that you can't easily slip out of it or slip into it. The problem is they're much too loose. So you have to tighten up the lacing significantly. This will give you a lot of excess cord up top so you will have to tie them like a regular shoe. Shock cord does not hold a knot very well and most people actually tie their shoes incorrectly. The not most are taught is actually a corruption of the proper knot and is infamous for loosening on its own which is why most people were taught this inferior method end up having to double knot. If you already have to tie the shoe you might as well just forego the shock cord and use superior oval shaped laces or use a Salomon quick adjuster style system. I will note that you will likely have to tighten up the laces even if you don't pull the insoles. One nice thing I will point out though is it this shoe does have a tongue instead of a knit. The tongue better distributes the pressure from the laces and makes for a more comfortable overall fit.  Usually when I evaluate footwear the first thing I look at is the outsole. Since it plays a major part in how practical the shoe is for my needs and how it wears and feels. The outsole here isn't as terrible as it could be but it's still pretty terrible. A prioritizes a frankly somewhat frightening and uncanny style over performance. The outsole is largely slick but it features a prominent image of a misshapen hand spread out on the top half of the outsole. On the heel you'll find a strange ring shape and an extra six finger that just kind of pops out strangely and wraps around the back of the shoe. On the knuckles of the hand, the design is slightly raised and has ridges that give a poor impression of lugs. The raised knuckles creates pressure points which aren't necessarily uncomfortable but does negatively affect how the shoe flexes and feels when moving. The ring design at the heel pops in and out strangely which makes for a unusual walking experience. The one thing that keeps the outsole from being a complete disaster is that it's made from a very soft rubber. This is the sole source of practical traction, the hand design isn't really doing anything. Soft rubber on the outsole is it tried and true method even on the best quality shoes. That's the whole idea behind a Vibram outsole. But soft rubber outsoles wear down quite quickly and pavement chews through them at a blistering pace. Without any proper lugs or tread if you actually end up using these shoes they will quickly wear down and become slick and you lose out on the little bit of traction you enjoyed when these awful shoes were new.  These aren't particularly expensive shoes so it's not surprising that the build quality isn't great. But I recently reviewed some shoes that fit a similar niche with much better build quality at a cheaper price point. The quality of leather is subpar and there are a large number of cutting errors that are visible on the edges. Although there are some double stitch areas most of the stitching is single stitch. Externally the stitching looks pretty good but internally you'll find a lot of sloppier stitching and some loose stitching. One thing that really bothered me is the product photos draw the eye to two rows of vents on the outside edge of the shoe. The product description doesn't explicitly draw attention to it, but does discuss how the shoes are breathable. The vent holes are purely cosmetic. I'm not sure what the black internal lining is specifically but it looks feels and smells like a thin layer of open cell neoprene. Open cell is undoubtedly the better choice if you're going to use neoprene, but neoprene is a poor choice for a liner. It does technically pull away moisture from the skin/socks but it does mean these shoes run hotter than what you would expect given the thin and poor quality leather it's made from.  The socks are just cheap thin black cotton socks in the same size of the shoe you ordered. They fit in a reasonably comfortable but they certainly aren't athletic socks or even every day socks.  I started out this review by insisting on wearing the shoes but they got so uncomfortable that I just had to take them off after the first paragraph. These shoes are truly awful. Your frame of reference for shoes has to be really bad to think that these are redeemable. There are hard pass and I'm counting down the days till I'm allowed to throw them in the trash. Don't spend your money on these.",6
