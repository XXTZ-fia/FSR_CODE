Overall construction and materials are good quality with no lose threads.  There is room for your driver's license and a credit card on one side, and 3 more credit cards on the other.  The outside pocket has slot to make getting the card out a bit easier.  I keep my go to credit card in this pocket.  The cards stick out of the rest of the pockets enough to grab them with a little effort.  A center pocket holds a few bills, and there are two more side pockets for more credit cards or receipts.  The center pocket is a little stiff to squeeze open, maybe due to the RF blocking?  Loaded up, it is still thin and light weight.  The black leather goes with about everything.  Nice wallet, I would recommend.",
Steve K,Slim but WIDE.  And that silver is.... very shiny!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YMMD2V42L4J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5CKVPQL,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 10, 2024",Color: Sand Silver,,"I wanted a new RFID blocking slim wallet and got this. First, don't get the gray/silver.  It's SHINY.  I am NOT confident enough to pull this out in public.  Second, while it's slim, it's WIDE and TALL. It's bigger than my old one.  Third, nowhere do I see or read that it's actually an RFID blocking device.  That's super important these days. So, maybe a no go for me but it might be up your alley.",

Mark A.

My old wallet was worn smooth leather and made for easy access. I like the number of cards it holds, the one with a slot on the outside (bottom slot, not clear slot for the ID) does not allow for an easy release of the card there. More effort than I expected to get a card out. It is affordable ... but I worry about how long it might last.",
Nicodene,Simple back pocket wallet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37JILSKJSWI9B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5CKVPQL,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 6, 2024",Color: Lichee Black,,"The wallet holds 3 cards and a photo ID. It has 2 side slots for cash, stamps, or any other slim item you want to keep in there. The bottom card slot and the ID slot have thumb openings to help get the items out. Obviously, the top ones do not and the slots get tighter from bottom to top so the top ones are really keeping that card securely in there. It is slim enough to be comfortably used in a back pocket without having to remove it when you sit. Worth the money if you’re looking for a back pocket wallet to grab the essentials and go!",

Geoffrey Hathaway,"Great, sleek look.  Fits a ton of stuff, but with a very tight fit.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R220T79R2410DU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5CKVPQL,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 6, 2024",Color: Carbon Fiber Black,,"I've been using this wallet for a few weeks now.  It is very slim and sleek, the faux carbon fiber design looks great.  My only complaint is that when it is full, it is a very tight fit. I know this will get better over time, but wanted to include that in my review.  This is perfect for anyone that doesn't carry much cash.",
Brighton West,Very Thin Wallet - Not Room for Cash - but who uses that anymore?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1633BGSZZ2G35/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5CKVPQL,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 3, 2024",Color: Carbon Fiber Black,,"This is a very thin wallet.  I bought it after tracking how often I used the cash I was carrying around with me. The answer: never. So why carry cash if you never use it. Get a thinner wallet with space for your ID and credit cards. That's what this wallet it. It has more than enough space for my cards.  There is one spot that allows you to push a card out from the bottom. However, it doesn't work very well. I have another wallet with this same design and very similar fabric and that card slides out when you push. This one sticks. It might be the width of the pocket. I guess I'd rather have too tight than too loose. Too loose and you lose your stuff!  Overall a great wallet if you no longer want to carry cash! And very reasonably priced.",

This wallet (Carbon Fiber Black) is not it. It looked really cool when I got it and it's slightly bigger than my old wallet. It's also rigid. My old wallet is basically denim, this new one feels more like plastic. I assumed it would ""loosen up."" I added my ID and 3 credit/debit cards. When I tried to add a tile slim tracker (a tile tracker about the same size of a credit card and about twice as thick) to the middle pocket, the wallet ripped. Maybe the other colors/styles will hold up better, but the Carbon Fiber Black wallet is not designed to last.",2
