I love the fit and feel of my other pairs but I hate these. My largest complaint is the pad and heel grips are jarring and noticeable after walking for even small stretches of time. And wearing them for even longer amounts of time will make your heel and toe pads sore. These two sections of the shoe protrude out further than the rest of the sole and actually hurt until worn down. Another complaint I have is how warm these shoes get. Now if you wear them in colder temps it’s not too noticeable but in the summer they are hard to keep on. The warmth has to be due to how insulated and unbreathable the fabric is. Again if you like warmer footwear this isn’t too much of a problem. But if you sweat in your feet at all or swell when warm you will notice it big time. With that being stated these shoes fit tight and hug your foot well, that would be a plus if they were any type of breathable. If your feet swell from heat and moisture there’s nowhere for your feet to stretch out to and they become even more uncomfortable. Since these shoes are don’t allow for air circulation if your shoes have a tendency to have odor these will most definitely get one. This isn’t a huge deal with most shoes as cleaning them is typically not too hard, but these shoes don’t have a removable insoles and are hard to wash. They are machine washable so I found flipping them inside out and air drying them the same way was the best option. But I had to rinse and repeat a few times to really get them clean. The quality is all over the place, I found the adhesive holding the sole to the sock part of the shoe to be middle of the road as they began to peel after a few months of wear. If I had to give these shoes any praises it’s on how they look, I really enjoyed the way they looked on my feet especially with baggier pants. Loved the silhouette and will be looking for a similar style from a different brand. Thanks for reading! Hope I gave some feedback that helped you in deciding if these were for you.",

I have 2 issues with these that prevent me from loving these, however.  My first issue is that the toe box is a bit tight and gets uncomfortable after long periods of wearing. I feel it cramming my toes and the way it pushes around inside of them causes pain if I wear them longer than an hour.  My second issue is that these get very, very warm after intermediate periods of wearing them. If I wear socks with them (which I recommend), my socks feel drenched from sweat due to the tight fit with lack of any ventilation.
