Figured Amazon has free returns, right??!! Other than it being a little more yellow orange than I would like (18k plate) this is a really nice piece of jewelry to dress up an outfit or be your new favorite go-to. I think the circles are a nice quality. While hollow so they aren't too heavy, they are weighted so they remain in place. The circles are large enough for someone to take notice- get your compliment,girl - but still small enough to make this dainty enough for class and everyday wear. The necklace has a the length option so you can have the option to wear it short or just a tad longer if you have a small neck. If you have a thicker neck, the adjustable length option will give you some 'play'.  Be aware, the clasp is small. If you have nails or gel overlay making your nails thick, may be a little tricky.",4

The two rings are interlocked with a doubled chain on either side. The necklace is adjustable so it can be worn as a looser choker or a short necklace. The rings have a heavy weight to them and feel expensive. The chain is on the thinner side, but does not tangle easily.  This necklace has quickly become a regularly worn item. It pairs well with casual outfits or can be dressed up with more earrings. It’s fun to fidget with while working. With regular wear I have had no issues with tarnishing or discoloring my neck. I’d highly recommend this necklace due to its versatility and the quality of its craftsmanship.",2
