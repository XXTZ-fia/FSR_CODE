This is not a designer card wallet type of item, but more for when going hiking or to the gym when she doesn't have to carry everything.  She is happy with it, so that's all it matters.  The price point is fair considering what it is.",

There are 4 card slots and a lengthwise pocket on one side and two pockets on the other side that are slanted. The slant makes for a nice design element, but I'm not sure you want to trust it to hold an important card. Perfect for 5-6 business cards or similar. The hot pink color is nice.",

The key ring is pretty sturdy and seems to have good retention. The inside has a pretty big area to hold cash or extra cards. The card area is stuff upon the first couple uses, but does become easier to remove cards with use. The only part I don't like are the front card holders. They're so much larger than a normal card that I'm very fearful of losing my ID or credit card. My ID has fallen out and lucky I heard it hit the ground or I would have lost it. Not sure what else to use the spot for so now I just leave them empty. Aside from that, good wallet.",2

SSH,"Nice Key Fob with Slim Wallet, but . . .",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R4O25NCC2IK6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQQSYBD7,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 25, 2024",Color: Black,,". . .

There is a zippered area, where you could store loose change or bills, but I will keep more important cards zipped securely inside.The nice thing about this wallet is that you will (most likely) notice right away if you drop it, since your keys are attached to it and will fall with a loud ""clunk.""  Also, you might not notice your wallet missing from your purse for quite some time, but you will notice that your keys are nowhere to be found when you head back to your car!  Having them both attached together (keys and wallet) is convenient!I have only had this item for a few days, so I cannot attest to its durability.  If anything negative were to occur during normal usage, I will update my review.",

It's fine for men or whatever gender you are. The zipper pocket can hold coins, which is nice if you're someone who still pays with cash. This wallet also has more card slots (6) than your average slim wallet (3-4), but it bulks up very unevenly, in a strange triangular shape, if you fill all of them. I took off the key ring. It didn't seem helpful. Overall this wallet is fine but I would not choose this product unless you really want that zipper pocket. If you don't need the coin pouch, you'll be better off with another design.",

It looks just like the picture. I like how it has so many pockets to put stuff the side with the name also has some kind of space to put stuff . I’m using the pouch part to carry the change I had in my other wallet. I also did a comparison of my last wallet it has all the same stuff but takes up way less space. Not sure how long it last but I usually use my stuff until it’s completely broken and unusable so I’ll update y’all if it ever starts peeling or something it also has a soft faux leather kinda feel which I don’t mind but just thought I should mention as well. I saw other comment about spacing but I think it depends on how much you carry as you see I only have enough cards to fill the slots and pocket change so it’s perfect for me rn!!,

What it needs is to be just a dash thicker. The two sides are sewn directly together, but if you fill all the slots, there isn't really enough room for it to fit all that, so it seems tight and stuffed. I wish that the bottom of it had maybe a 1/4"" width to it. That would make it perfect.  I will still use it, of course. I'll also keep my eye out for one that has a bit of width to it.",

I removed it as it provided an easy way for thieves to pull the wallet out of my pocket.  It seems well put together, with the slots providing enough tension to keep single cards in without making it too difficult to pull them out. The ID side is oddly designed and would have been better with additional slots like the reverse side.
