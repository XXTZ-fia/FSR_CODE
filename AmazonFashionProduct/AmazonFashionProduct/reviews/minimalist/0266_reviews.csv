I am happy to say that this newer version of the shoes has much stronger straps that have held up through weeks and weeks of daily use - so the 5 stars have been earned! These shoes are great for her wide feet and they're so comfortable for her that she doesn't want to wear any others. They are true to size and fit as expected. The pattern inside and the tabs on the straps make them easy for her to put on herself. The fabric and soles of the shoes are also holding up great for how hard she plays in these shoes! Yes, they're slightly more expensive than something like the basic Cat & Jack tennies - but they are so much better quality and fit, especially for kiddos with wider feet. I will absolutely be coming back to this brand when my daughter needs a new pair of shoes!",

And for kids that will outgrow everything in literally the blink of ONE eye, I decided to go the cheaper route and get these. So far, so good. My kid's toes aren't crowded, they go on super easy, and they have this cute dog on the inside heel part, it's halved, and when you put the shoes together the right way the dog is in correct position, so it kind of gives the kids an additional visual so they get the right shoe on the right foot (and the left shoe on the left foot...ahah...okay bad joke).  Lots of sizes and colors, so when he outgrows this pair I will simply purchase another one. When their shoe sizes stabilize, I will probably pursue vivo barefoots, as that is what me and my spouse wear.",

The quality and durability of these shoes are outstanding. The design is clearly crafted with kids' needs in mind, featuring a super wide toe box that accommodates chunky feet perfectly. This thoughtful design promotes natural toe splay and comfort, which is great for my child's developing feet.  The natural barefoot comfort these shoes provide is impressive. The wide toe box and low drop enhance ground feel and foot flexibility, which are crucial for healthy foot development. My child seems more confident and comfortable while running and playing, thanks to the excellent foot protection and sensory awareness these shoes offer.  One of the best features is the hook and loop straps. The upgraded Velcro is durable and makes it easy for my child to put the shoes on and take them off independently. This feature is fantastic for boosting their sense of autonomy.  The breathable fabrics and comfortable insoles are perfect for all-day wear. Whether it's walking, running, or jumping, these shoes keep my child's feet cool and comfortable throughout the day.  Lastly, the AB dog pattern insoles are a clever touch, helping my child quickly learn to differentiate between the left and right shoes, which makes getting ready a lot easier.  Overall, these shoes are a fantastic investment in both quality and comfort, and I highly recommend them for any parent looking for durable, well-designed footwear for their little ones.",

That wouldn’t be a problem except that when I tighten the straps, the strap is so long on the other side that it no longer  makes contact with the other Velcro side if that makes sense. I could probably solve that issue by trimming off an inch of the end of the strap, but that would probably result in it unraveling. Great comfort, flexible sole, color options are great.
