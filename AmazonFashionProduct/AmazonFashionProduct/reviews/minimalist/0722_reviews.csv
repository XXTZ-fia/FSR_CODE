It is not a mood ring, it does not change color. It's some reflective material that reflects different colors in different angles of light. It DOES NOT change colors, it reflects different colors. You can see what i mean in the photos and video. AND, the ring isn't even filled in all the way, as you can see in the photos. I'm only keeping this because my grandma would be so sad and think she picked the wrong ring. SCAM",

One Reviewer,"Poor Quality Control in Color Changing Portion of Cabochon, Too Little Filling and Off Center Inside",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRCTUP44ULPR5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08N2MJ92R,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 30, 2021",,,"I was happy to find a mood ring that had a stainless steel band, but was very disappointed in how there is a major defect in the color changing cabachon itself. There's some sort of clear glitter base on one side, then there's a portion of a globule of “color changing stuff” off to the side. It's not like in the photos. From looking at this, there's not much if any quality control happening prior to sending these out, as this one would have been held back.  The small amount that there is of the “color changing stuff” does change like a mood ring cabochon should. The stainless steel band is nicely done and basic. However off-kilter and unbalanced way that the color changing portion is done seriously detracts from the ring itself, especially at the current price point of over 20 bucks. Sadly, despite being one of the few mood rings that I am aware of that offer stainless steel bands, the poor quality control of the color changing material/filling is enough to make me look elsewhere. Thanks for reading.",3

This makes a nice gift and also makes for some fun conversation about the mood reading. The ring comes in an attractive jewelry box which can be stuffed in a gift bag. I'm happy with the ring in general and my biggest complaint is the band which isn't highly polished and is slightly dull.,
