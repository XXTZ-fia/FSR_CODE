I have recommended this wallet to many of my male friends who spend a lot of time outdoors for work or who fish and hunt a lot like I do. I was looking at the wallet the other day and it literally looks exactly like it did when I purchased it many years ago. The biggest advantage is that it lays very flat and does not make a big bulge in you back pocket.  I highly recommend this wallet - I am 50 years old and it is the best one I have ever found.",

The card slots are little tight, but I found that adding two cards to each slot will help stretch it out (giggity) making it easier to remove cards. The cash slot is something that is tight as well, but it does the job.  Typically I carry my ID, a debit card, a credit card, a wallet bottle opener tool, and few hundred pesos. The wallet keeps everything in place and held so closely together that you can still comfortably stick it in your front pocket",2

I can still carry cash, yes cash, remember that paper we used to use. Recently on a trip to Mexico, our cards were not working, and guess who saved the day with cash…that’s right! It saved our vacation that day. I think it looks tacticool and I can keep a lot of stuff in it. It’s practical for keeping receipts and it’s half as big as my last wallet. I’ve been using it for a couple of months now and it’s loosened up a bit but some of those cards are still hard to get out. It does have 2 spots for the cards that you use the most and those are easy to get out.

I like that it holds relatively a lot of cards and some bills for its size it is compact enough to place in my front pocket without printing.

It is very lightweight, and has held up well over the past few months, with no more holes in my pants. I carry 8 credit-card sized items, a thin insurance card and an extra folded $50. Everything fits easily, with plenty of room for cash in the larger compartment.  Some observations:  The wallet flops closed when you set it down. This is plus in my book.  It is not RFID blocking, and I can store my work badge in the cash slot.  It holds a reasonable amount of cash, without requiring it to be folded multiple times.  Each side of the wallet has two slots for cards, a skinny one-card slot on top, and the wider multi-card slot beneath it. It is NOT easy to slide a card out of the top slot, nor is it easy to quickly return it. I ended up putting my primary card in the bottom of the lower slot. It is easier to get the card out, and much easier to return the card. However, I would have preferred that this card be in the top slot.",3

Stinky Britches,Solid but small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18W3BP0I55QBF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NJ17N1J,"3.0 "," the United States "," April 9, 2021",Color: Olive Drab Green,Verified Purchase,"It's a very solid wallet, but you can't put more than 2 or 3 bills (make sure they're crisp or good luck getting them in without the corners folding up) and a few cards. Once you hit about 4 bills it won't sit flat anymore.  Also I'd argue the card slots need to be cut a millimeter or two wider, as it can be frustrating to have the cards keep catching as you're trying to put them back in. It's a difficult balance between too small and too large, I feel it's just a touch small if you use your cards frequently.  I thought it would loosen up as I sat on it or used it, but it seems no less stiff than when I got it after several weeks of use and keeping weight on it when not in use.  Also noticed a few threads starting to fray from the edge but I'm guessing that won't go far.  I'm not a minimalist when it comes to having cash on hand and I have to carry 3 key cards and a minimum of 3 credit cards, so I had my doubts to begin with. I was encouraged by some reviews but I knew it was likely too small.  I do like that I can sit on it for at least short drives without hurting my sciatic nerve or back, but I wish they'd make a little larger version for those who need to carry more (otherwise it just becomes not having the denomination or card you need, or carrying an additional billfold, etc. - binder clips make the best billfolds/money clips for those who go this route.)  Overall it's okay, but not my favorite wallet. Would only recommend to pure minimalists. I love magpul though, including the daka pouches, and the durability is absolutely a plus.",5
