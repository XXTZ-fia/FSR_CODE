Hannah,"Two Wallets, 10 Years Apart",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P17ROZXPI6ZX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DBBH6BQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 20, 2024",Color: Black Sailcloth,Verified Purchase,"I get sweaty and the traditional leather wallets can't handle it. The leather gets nasty, smelly, and the cash sometimes will get soaked too. I used to replace the wallets probably once a year either from it getting disgusting or falling apart from sweating.  I purchased my first Flowfold on Dec 2014, hoping for a minimalistic, lightweight yet durable wallet. It was the one I was looking for! It doesn't take up a big space, very durable, and easily wiped clean. I believe I could have kept mine for a little longer but my wife got me a new one as a part of my birthday gift.  The pictures are comparison between my ""almost"" 10 year old Flowfold wallet and a brand new one. I will be returning 10 years later for another one.",

GCMRN,Excellent wallet truly built for life,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OPIN76TTD179/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DBBH6BQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 7, 2021",Color: Black Sailcloth,Verified Purchase,It is not every day you find a product that really does live up to expectations- this wallet does! I thought I would give it a try- price was a bit high- but I wanted something durable that can take being accidentally washed- or dunked in the ocean. Most wallets last for two years at most- and I have used all types including the Tyvek ones-- after a few years the corners wear out. This was no exception and it started to fray in one of the corners. I did not expect to get a new one no questions asked- but I did. Have a look at the pictures- you can see that the wear in the corner is making the threading start to fray and the inner pockets show chafing wear. Still works great even after two years though. I passed the old one to my son who really wanted it- I have no doubts it will serve him well for several more years at least... I have no problems highly recommending flowfold and will be looking at whatever else they make. This kind or outstanding product and support DESERVES my continued patronage and I hope the company keeps making these wallets for a long time. I am a customer- I bought this flowfold and in no way was I given anything for free or incentivized in any way to review it. YMMV - but this one will take you there and back more than a few times.,

I thought to review it because I am looking at ordering another version that is non fold so even more minimalist.  Not because this version is too large, just because now that I've become more used to carrying less, I can probably reduce it further.
