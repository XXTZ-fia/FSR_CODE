It seems to read the card that is the closet (top card) the more stuff between the reader and the nfc chip delays the read/copy. guess if you're a tinfoil hat kind of person maybe keep an expired honeypot style card on the top of your wallet facing out so if someone was to bump you, they would only get the junk card?",
