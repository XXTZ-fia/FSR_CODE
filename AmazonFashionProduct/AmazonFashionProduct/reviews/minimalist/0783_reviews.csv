Overall, this wallet is nearly perfect, particularly in terms of the bifold design and card slots, which comfortably fit two cards each without stretching or stressing the material. However, I must deduct stars because the elastic clip section contains a component that, when sliding cards in and out, has completely ruined the magnetic strip and outer coating on my cards. While the wallet is excellent in most respects, this flaw is significant enough to warrant a 2-star rating.",2
The Philosopher,Great Hybrid Wallet.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WWFANDJ55K1T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7YSPYJ2,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 16, 2024",Material Type: Alaska Leather1Color: Brick Brown4692,,"I have purchased many wallets over the years -- everything ranging from thrift store canvas bi-folds, all the way to the best and most exquisite and luxurious wallets with exotic materials.  I find that the expensive wallets are too bulky and heavy, and the thin, metal wallets are too thin, slender, and do not accommodate everything I need to carry in a wallet.  This is where the hybrid design of this wallet comes in. It strikes a perfect balance between compactness and volume. I can manage to fit enough credit cards, ID, and cash in it perfectly without too much bulge or heft.  Made with genuine materials and handsome to boot, this is a solid wallet for any kind of man and makes for a wonderful, thoughtful gift.",
Brandon,Great wallet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FSYV3EUBY57G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7YSPYJ2,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 7, 2024",Material Type: Alaska Leather1Color: Red Brick4693,Verified Purchase,"This wallet is great size with it closed measuring about 2 3/4 in wide, 3 3/4 top to bottom and about 1 inch deep with 5 cards in holder. It’s easy to handle and feels good in the hand. Each flap inside and out has a pocket for misc cards or whatever they are a bit small for my credit cards but I'm good with it, the flap is magnetic which i like it feels strong as-well and not cheap or flimsy. It also has your window for id. My only con to this wallet is i wish the card holder had a solid base to prevent cards slipping out and a trigger to lift cards up. Other than that well worth the money so far",
