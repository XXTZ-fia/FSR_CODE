The style is good, fit is great. Comfort is where this shoe excels. It truly feels as though I'm barefoot while walking around. I will buy another pair for casual wear. I would like to see how long this pair lasts and wears through a cold winter. For the price, it is worth the try.",

I usually wear these with wool socks from Costco and they are very warm and comfortable.  I purchased a size larger than I would normally wear to provide room for a larger sock, but I don't think it was needed. If I had to purchase again I would buy the same size as my VFF and Whitin shoes.  My only really complaint is that these came with stretchy elastic laces that when secure, they were too tight and otherwise they didn't keep the shoes on my feel, they constantly felt loose. I replaced the laces with 45in boot laces and they work great now.  I have not tried wearing these in snow yet as Minnesota has decided not to snow this winter.",7

My left foot/leg is crooked and I have a lot of adema in my leg including my foot so getting anything but a clog type shoe on is a battle. At first I couldn't get this shoe on but after adding clip-on shoe horns to the back it slid right on. The wide toe allows my crookedness to fit in perfectly. I also live in MN land of frozen rain (mostly) so far this year. These shoes have allowed me the traction I need to stay vertical.,2

Kimberly Bernardon,**UPDATED AGAIN 01/16/24** *UPDATED REVIEW 12/26/23* These are NOT Waterproof,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R273N0ZVC3T572/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCVNQ36Y,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 6, 2023",Size: 8.5 Women/7 MenColor: Yellow,Verified Purchase,"UPDATE 01/16/24 - I had to come back here again and reiterate how terribly NOT waterproof and NOT warm these shoes are.  To advertise these as a ""winter"" shoe is actually false advertising.  I live in NJ and temperatures have been below 30 degrees.  These offer NO warmth.  If it is spitting rain or you walk on wet ground (not stepping in puddles, just walking on a sidewalk or street after it rains) your feet will be soaking wet.  Other than looking cute in dry conditions, these are a terrible purchase.  Please do not spend your money if you are looking for waterproof or warmth.UPDATE: 12/26/23 - these are NOT waterproof.  My socks are getting wet through the top of the shoe and also somehow they're getting wet on the bottom.  It almost seems like they're leaking at the sole.  I'm really disappointed because they're very lightweight and comfortable but they are now a waste of my money since they are not waterproof at all.  I'm so glad I didn't buy another pair.These are great!  I normally wear an 8.5 womens and these fit just like I expected however I wish that they were available in a 9 so I could wear my thick winter socks with them.  I think they're going to feel a bit snug with thick socks but overall these are fantastic.  I got them to walk my dog in the winter as the grass is wet and sometimes frozen in the morning and my feet were getting soaked and freezing.  These feel great on, the elastic laces make them fully adjustable and the grip is fantastic on the soles.  I'm so pleased that I'm going to order the black pair that come up a little higher on the ankle so I have another choice.  Also, these look great with leggings for a cute casual winter look so they're a two-fer!",17
Mercedes,Very lightweight & comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMLWVVS3QYLAI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCVNQ36Y,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 2, 2023",Size: 11.5 Women/10 MenColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I like that they are very comfortable! I wear an 11 in womens and with the wide toe box they are really good to my feet. I also bought a few more pairs of toe socks to wear with them. They didn't come with any extra soles which is just fine because the ones inside the shoes are good and I can always buy some others if I choose. If you have wide feet they'll be a good fit as well. The string is stretchy so you tighten the shoe to your foot versus tying loose strings. As far as warmth they do it for me, I live where it doesn't snow so I don't have to worry about that, the insides of the shoes are lined with soft faux fur just around the rim/ankle/tongue. Shipping was very fast I ordered them maybe a week ago ?? Which was the 25th It said delivery would be on the 15th but they came yesterday on the 1st. I'm a satisfied buyer!! Thank you very much I will enjoy wearing these! ☆☆☆☆☆",3
Roland D,Do not order a size larger than normal because of the fur lining -Order your normal size..,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CEDOAQ3X637S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCVNQ36Y,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2023",Size: 14 Women/12.5 MenColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I took a chance on these boots because there were no previous reviews and I ordered a size larger than I normally wear because according to reviews on similar fur lined boots from other suppliers that didn't stock my size (not even the size I normally wear)... Those reviews advised getting a pair one size larger because of the fur lining. However the fur you see in the photos is ONLY around the neck of the boot and the top of the tongue. Below that is a lining of fuzzy felt. I'd have been fine if I'd ordered my usual size. That said, I can make them work for me and they are warmer than my normal barefoot shoes. They are also well made and I'll be keeping them. I've only given 4* because of the misleading description that gives the impression that they are fur lined throughout.",19
