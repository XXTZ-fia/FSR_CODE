Jessica,Same style totally different fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TY2YKPNVO21M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GFD6ZZ,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Size: 7 WideColor: All Black,Verified Purchase,It seems there’s different sellers maybe even manufacturers for the brand. My first  pair was much wider more toe box room. Second pair ( black high tops) were much tighter in the toe area as well as the stitching being crooked and the back of the shoe leaning to the inner side. Sadly having to return,

Jessica L,Smaller than non high top whitins,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK19736ZHLBR6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GFD6ZZ,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 24, 2024",Size: 10 WideColor: All Black,,I have a pair of the regular whitins so I ordered the same size in the high tops but the high tops were too small so it might be wise to size up!

They are SO comfortable- I hate nothing more than my toes being jammed into a too-small shoe. They are great quality- I’ve washed a pair several times and haven’t seen any wear on them yet. I work a lot in a school and these shoes are slip resistant- they help out majorly in the kitchen! I have told everyone I know about these shoes! I will be buying more in different colors as I’ve donated the majority of my other shoes at this point!,5

I decided to open them and try them on and surprisingly they fit! I like the look and feel of them. They are definitely cheaply made but I find this brand a good option for those not wanting to spend so much on other barefoot brands.  I have a different pair of Whitin shoes size 9 that came as European 40 and fit great. I ordered these hight tops in size 9 like last time, but size 41 came, which are too big for me. I'm going to exchange for a size 8 when they are back in stock and will update my review.",
H.,Mostly good,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2P5DPV8H6AUNC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GFD6ZZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2024",Size: 8 WideColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,I like them. They look really nice and I have received compliments. But it feels like maybe the inside sole doesn’t reach all the way to the end of the shoes. My toes feel kind of like they’re hanging off a tiny little cliff and it does make them ache after a while,
Phil's Favorites,Extra cheaply made,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LPHMZZYXA415/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GFD6ZZ,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 18, 2024",,,"Cute design, but the material digs in across the toe knuckle bones where you would really want it to be comfortable. If you open the shoestring all the way to widen it at the bottom there, the shoestring then isn't long enough to go through the top hole, and it still doesn't loosen enough, digging in across the toe knuckle area. There is plenty of room in the toe box to move your toes around if you can get past the pain the tightness on your bones causes. Also, the color is fine, but the material is noticeably cheap to the feel especially. I would have happily paid more for the same shoe made with a higher quality material and enough space across my toe knuckles! Oh well...",2

Affordable bare feet shoes! Although when they arrived they felt cheap, like they’re going to fall apart, but so far they’ve been really comfortable(except the first day when breaking them in). The material is different, kind of rough, that if they got dirty it’d be hard to clean. Originally bought a white and black pair of the ankle bare shoes for training over a year ago and I wear them almost every day for the gym and work and school. Really comfortable and my feet don’t get tired in them. Also since switching over to bare shoes I don’t get back pain or knee pain.",

My toes have enough room to spread out, and yet the shoe does not make my feet look too wide or ""clowny.""

Matthew H.,I really like the look of these!!…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PKTNKUOANB0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9GFD6ZZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 17, 2024",Size: 7 WideColor: All White,Verified Purchase,"I have the Whitin Chelsea boots and was super excited to try their new hightops. I got these and the other (Converse) style. Time will tell, but I like everything accept the back section around the ankle that definitely rubbed some until I loosened the laces way up, and it’s still a bit of pressure in the back of my achilles heel… we’ll see if that continues to be an issue or not. Otherwise I sized up from a 7 (what I got the Chelsea in) to an 8 and that was the right choice for me wanting a looser barefoot feel in this style, I think a 7 would have been too short. Great 90’s vibes in a low cost barefoot shoe!!",2

They are definitely wide enough and feel comfortable after walking all day at work. They are pretty warm which will be great for fall/winter. I normally wear a 40 in other barefoot shoes but I ordered up based on other reviews and 41 is perfect. Love the high top version as it’s hard to find a good high top sneaker that’s also barefoot. Only time will tell how durable they are but great first impressions.",18
