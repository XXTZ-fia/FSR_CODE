The flexibility allows me to feel the ground which has changed the way I walk, I feel like I practically glide. They seem to be holding up super well, no issues with the sole coming unglued which is typical for cheaper shoes. The only downside is that the laces are EXTREMELY long, so I recommend swapping them for shorter ones or elastic laces. Other than that they are amazing!",

Yeti,My favorite shoes. 8 months of daily wear. Inner liner is the weakest link.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RQBY5FKJDSEL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4DS7M7G,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Size: 13 WideColor: Grey Gum,Verified Purchase,"Ive been wearing barefoot/minimalist shoes for roughly 15 years. I have been through all the big brands in the space, and some of the little ones. Merrell, Vivobarefoot, Lems, Xero, Softstar, and Vibram to name a few.  For sports/fitness, I prefer 5 Fingers, but I don't want to wear those to work and just around. Ive been through so many other casual shoe types. They are very expensive, and you don't get more for your money. Merrell used to be my fav, but their designs and durability have gone away. Vivobarefoot is ok, but they are expensive as heck. Lems are too padded, softstars are made of leather and can be decent, but they look a little silly too. I always want to like xero shoes, but they just are never quite comfortable, and spendy.  Enter Whitin... I discovered these a few years ago. Not all the styles work for me. Some are too narrow, and some of the styles are a bit dopey. But these are just shoes. Not too thick, not too thin. Exterior is extremely durable and sheds dirt and stuff kindof magically and automatically. I haven't washed the shoes in the pictures for 8 months, and i just went dumpster diving yesterday and got them all dusty... they still look reasonable. I've NEVER had a sole delaminate from a whitin shoe. The other style i had before these was a bit better in overall durability, but was a bit narrow and flared up by bunion issue. Those ones lasted till the sole wore through.  These ones do have a couple downsides. They wont last forever. The weak link in this style is the inner liner. It wore through wear the sole pushes in while my foot pushes out. This let tiny rocks work their way into the layers of the liner behind my heel, and i cant get them out, so im calling this pair dead after 8 months. I have already ordered another. 40$ for 8 months of daily wear and abuse works for me.",

I purchased them for $20 back in July 2023 but for todays price I'd want them to last longer than that. The sole has a hole on the ball of my left foot, which is a good sign because you're supposed to walk on the ball of your feet and that area gets the most impact.  I'm going to try to repair them with shoe goo to make them last to the summer and when I replace them I'll probably look around for a harder sole to last a bit longer.",

The material is breathable and light, and my feet don’t feel like they’re suffocating in them. Superior functionality as they allow my feet to flex the way they’re designed to. The first couple days my feet were sore at the end of the day; but that’s just par for the course when you first start out in barefoot shoes.

With that said, they are also probably the goofiest looking pair of shoes I've ever owned.  I wear a size 13 so I jokingly refer to these as my clown shoes.  However, I'm at the age where I'm not concerned with the look of my shoes as much as the comfort.I bought a couple pairs of Brooks shoes recently and had to go to a size 14 to allow for sufficient space for my toes.  As a result it feels like I'm wearing skis, which is especially annoying when I'm driving my manual transmission car.  They work great for my running routine and for when I'm going to be on my feet all day, but that's about it.  The Whitin shoes with the wide toe box allow me to buy a size 13 which fits much better and allows me to feel the peddles in my MT much more.I highly recommend these shoes and I'm sure this will be my first pair of many!",4
