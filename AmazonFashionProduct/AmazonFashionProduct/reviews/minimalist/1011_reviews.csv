NFLMVP,ALL THREE COLORS HAVE SNAPS (as of April 2023),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BDV80GXG8UXT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08ZYM7GRL,"3.0 "," the United States "," April 7, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Coffee,Verified Purchase,"I asked a question about this item because a number of reviews indicated that some colors did not have snaps.  In response to my question, three buyers indicated that the black wallet does not have snaps. I don’t know how long ago they purchased theirs, but I recently purchased all three colors, hoping to find one without the snap. Bottom line, THE ALL HAVE SNAPS.  The first one I purchased, the coffee colored  wallet, had a snap. I returned it and purchased the black and brown colored wallets.  Both also had snaps.This was seriously disappointing to me but should have been expected, since the ad indicates there’s a snap.  However, even more disappointing is that this used to be an exceptional wallet.  The addition of a snap is wholly unnecessary to closing the wallet but more importantly, adds extra bulk.Now, my rating isn’t based on the fact that the wallet has a snap.  It’s advertised as such.  Instead, my rating is based on the fact that the snap defeats the purpose of a “slim” wallet.  With a limited number of cards in it, it is lopsided and wider than necessary on one side of the wallet.  With a wallet stuffed full of cards, it becomes unusable.A number of years ago, I purchased the same wallet, and it had no snap. It fit my needs perfectly.  I’ve generally worn it out over time, which is not unexpected.  What I remembered from my original purchase is that finding this particular style was very difficult. Amazons search algorithms don’t make it any easier and they insist on showing me things that do not match my search terms.Luckily, I was able to find another, but I still had to wade through search results that were not a match.  My search terms were “credit card external ID window, wallet, men’s“. I found a wallet that’s nearly identical to this one, without the snap, and I couldn’t be happier.",4
