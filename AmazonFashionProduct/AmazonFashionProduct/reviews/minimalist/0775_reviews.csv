Sarah B,A bit too small!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NPPW97XQ8OP7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BXX22111,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Size: 8 Women/6 MenColor: Fuchsia Rose,Verified Purchase,"So I did try to wear these. I really should have returned them but I had hoped they would work out... But they didn't. They are a size or two too small!  I can wear them for a super short walk in the early morning, like an hour or less. But my mistake came when I tried to dumbly do an all day walk wearing these. My toes ended up banging against the very front of the shoe and my big toenail turned purple!  So I have worn these very little. A few short walks, one long all day walk (and that ended up being very painful indeed)....  The bottoms get VERY SLIPPERY on wet surfaces!! I know the bottoms have those texture things but if you are crossing a wet street those white lines - oye - super slippery!! I would not dare to think of wearing these on ice! No way!!  These are barefoot style shoes so free of arch support. Which is what I had wanted.  I do love the insoles that came with these shoes. I wish they were sold separately. I am using them at the moment in another pair of shoes.  I am unsure why that right shoe is so crooked and leaning? I have hardly wore these at all. Maybe 5 hours total for the short walks and the long walk was probably another 4 or 5 hours?  Its hard to judge the quality as I got the wrong size but it was the size that Amazon had said was my size. Clearly they are way off! My big toe is literally jammed at the front of the shoe and that is the shoe with no insoles in it.  The depth ( with no insoles) is good and so is the shoe width.  Oh for comparison these were a size 38. In the Xero Prio I wear a size 8 and in the Dbeck I am wearing a 9. My Xero sandals are also an 8.  The shoes seem sturdy and they do seem well made. They are just too small for my feet! If you wear an 8 in Xero you probably need a size larger than a 38 in these. Or else you will get purple toes like I did! My toenail is still purple.",

I have Morton's toe (my first toe is as long as / slightly longer than my big toe), which I read AFTER purchasing the Vibram Fivefingers makes them not a good fit for my foot.

I've had significant pain relief, and my  posture has gotten better since I've worn these. They weigh next to nothing. They're come in many different colors. The grip is perfect, I've gone hiking in them once with no issues. They are extremely breathable, probably not best of you don't want your feet getting wet. I've washed them twice since I've had them, and theyve held up great. They come out looking brand new. Purchased for my son and he only ever wants to wear these!!!",
