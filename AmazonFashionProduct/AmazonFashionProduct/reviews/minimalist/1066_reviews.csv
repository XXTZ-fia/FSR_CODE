Quality Control,So chintzy and impossible to get your foot secured.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1T3FLSQ1WWJNV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4C25KHT,"1.0 "," the United States "," September 1, 2024",Size: 8Color: Bright Blue,Verified Purchase,It's just looks like cheap foam from the dollar store with some tread and a thick ribbon. It's very difficult to get your foot in and out because you have to take the back ankle strap off and then velcrow it back on so the closure needs a total new redesign.  The company also chooses these clown colors.  Smells like cheap toxic plastic that's off gassing fumes.  Not a winner. I've returned them.,

Book Lover,These are not barefoot shoes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R164KFB10J8XJI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4C25KHT,"2.0 "," the United States "," August 16, 2024",Size: 9Color: Bright Blue,Verified Purchase,The straps are in the wrong place for these to be barefoot shoes. My feet hurt so badly by the end of my 1 hour hike because the straps were not allowing my toes to splay out like barefoot shoes would. They are too high on the toes. My left big toe felt sprained for days after wearing these. I tried to move my foot up more towards the end of the shoe so the strap was lower as it should be but then my toes hung off the end. Then there was the other strap problem. There needs to be a better holder for the strap at the inside lower part of the ankle because I would get it where I wanted it but the strap tightens on its own around my ankle instead of staying in place. Each point of turn for the strap should be able to secure there so it doesn’t tighten past where you want it. I wear a 9.5 and decided to get a 9 because they don’t have half sizes. It would have been the perfect fit if the straps had been lower on the toes. In the picture my left big toe is out showing the shoe would have still fit if the strap had been lowered. Instead that toe was hurting so badly.,

Wandered the Botanical Garden in Montréal for like 5-6 hours without getting foot sore. Sandal straps often hit me in funny places and cause blisters, but no problem with these, which are smooth and soft anyway. Thought the toe might be floppy, but I adjusted the strap to move my foot forward and it was fine. Ran next to my kid on a bike and didn’t worry about it. Wore them in the water and they dried faster than my old Tevas. Thought I might be able to feel the lugs through the thin sole but I don’t notice them. My only complaint is the lugs under the arch are too close together. The sole flexes with your foot, so these really grab and hold on to dirt and gravel, which is next to impossible to clean out of them. I’ll never walk indoors in them again. On the trail they grab and hold onto wet leaf littler, which compromises traction. Fix that and they’d be a five star sandal.",9

I have very high arches so I always assumed I needed to have shoes with high arches. However, after doing some research, I realized maybe that wasn't the best thing for my feet. So I have been slowly transitioning to minimalist shoes. I found these sandals fairly easy to acclimate to. However, I have bunions on both feet and anyone with bunions knows they're kind of unsightly and the sandals definitely don't cover them up. The pros are they are lightweight and seem to have a good grip on the sole. The cons for me are the velcro strap in the back, if you are an animal lover and have fur in your house, you understand that velcro doesn't last too long. Normally I wear anything from a size 6 to 8 depending on the shoe and had originally ordered a seven but they were way too large so I had to drop down to a 6 and they fit fairly well but occasionally the heel cup in the back is uncomfortable and the straps that go around the ankle are too long. Normally I would just cut the straps off and burn them, but these don't look like they're meant to be done like that. The footbed of the sandals are not good when they get wet. My feet slip around in them a lot so that's unfortunate. And after wearing them for a full day of work on tile floor, my feet definitely feel the impact. Another issue for me coming from Chacos that have a thick sole and living in a sandy climate is I get a lot more dirt and debris in my sandals since they are thin soled. It's not a game changer but I wish I could actually wear these sandals and be able to return them and not have the ""return in like new condition stipulation"", if so I probably would have said no but I guess that's how they get you. It was also sad to see the 'Made in China' on the shoes but isn't everything these days. We shall see how long they last.",13

I wore them for years, until finally the buckles wouldn't hold anymore and they kept getting loose as I ran, and the treads on the bottom side of the sole where I land and push off was wearing out. I saw that this model had sturdier material better bite on the buckles, so hoping they'd last longer. -The straps aren't as soft as before, so they do require some break-in and callous buildup for wide feet like mine. (Don't go out on a hard 7 mile trail run first thing lol.) -The bite on the buckles is much better, they hold the straps in place and don't loosen up. -The new layer on the footbed is very good, has better grip between the foot and shoe when wet. Still slip a little, but as long as the straps are tight enough, foot won't slide forward out of the front of the sandal on fast steep descents. -Fun tan lines.  So far I've work them on 10 milers on trails and roads. Because they are true minimal footwear, running fast along dry riverbeds, and down rough, rocky un-maintained carriage roads does beat the soles of the feet pretty hard, but no less than minimal trail running sneakers.

Lin Dee,Nice sandals but buy a 1/2 size up - not down,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P6WVL9VN5IP6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4C25KHT,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 30, 2022",Size: 10Color: Multi-black,Verified Purchase,"I bought these sandals for running and am very happy with them. The style I bought does not come in half sizes. I made the mistake of buying the half size smaller, rather than going up to the next size. So I had to send back the original pair. They are a little pricey, but I would still recommend because they are ultra comfortable and great for running.",2

Seriously the most comfortable sandal ever, it’s just like being barefoot.",
janna,Must get your feet would love you for it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SLPDYGWITR4Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4C25KHT,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 8, 2022",Size: 8Color: Multi-black,Verified Purchase,"Love my xero sandals! I feel they have the right amount of flexibility and cushion. I am new to minimalist wearing and these are perfect. Walked all around town, the beach without any issues. Great grip when crossing over wet rocks.  I did size up. I am normally a size 7. The 7 did fit however the edge on the back of sandal pushed my foot forward making my pinkie toes stick out. Some people don’t mind that but I prefer my toes inside the sandal itself. So I ordered an 8 and it’s a great fit. If they did have half sizes I feel a 7.5 would be perfect as there would be less to tightened, but and extra pull it’s not a big deal.",6
Phoebe Kiser,"Good grip, comfy, lightweight",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CZ2QAU94XQXJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4C25KHT,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 8, 2022",Size: 8Color: Multi-black,Verified Purchase,This is my first pair of Xero shoes. I've had other barefoot brands and I love them all. These sandals are super lightweight and comfy. I was climbing all over wet rocks at the beach without slipping around. I'll probably buy more of them when I run these down. I would say they are kind of expensive for sandals though. I wish they were a little more affordable.,10
Jessica Olinyk,Good sandals for a season,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QBAK0BDUKRMY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4C25KHT,"2.0 "," the United States "," April 5, 2022",Size: 9Color: Multi-black,Verified Purchase,"I really enjoyed these sandals. They lasted one summer without any major wear or anything breaking. I give these a low star review, because like I said they wore out after one summer. Stretched a bit, the fit is just different. Along with that I am shocked to see that these sandals DOUBLED in price since I bought them. These are not worth $84... They're really over marketing the barefoot  feel. Pretty ridiculous. I just went to order another pair and after seeing the price, I'll find a more reasonable brand that will hopefully last more than one year for $84.",18
