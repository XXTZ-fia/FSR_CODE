Dr. Glenn,Great Versatile Shoe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AO2875USTSUL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNRY4CB9,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 25, 2024",Size: 9.5Color: Black/Grey,Verified Purchase,"I was looking for a gym shoe that I could wear for my various cardio machines as well as a comfortable shoe for my strength training.  This is my third INOV8 shoe and it fits the bill.  I could wear this on my treadmill, my rowing machine and all of my weight lifting exercises.  It is extremely comfortable, lightweight and stylish.  The only caveat is that you may need to order a half size up from other shoes.  i normally wear a nine in New Balance, so I order a nine and a half with my INOV8.  I have loads of other athletic shoes, this one will get plenty of use.",

CT,1/2 size short,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L1Z2M5IG5249/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNRY4CB9,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 13, 2024",Size: 8.5Color: Black/Grey,Verified Purchase,"What’s good/great 1. The sole is awesome, grippy rubber, thick yet flexible. 2. Insole is AMAZING!! 3. Toe box/width. Finally a workout shoe that is shaped like actual feet. 4. The drop is low at 4mm but didn’t feel noticeable to me (I wear 0 drop shoes normally).  Thing to be aware is they run half size too small. I’m normally between 8-8.5 US. The 8.5 was too short for me.  What I didn’t like and why I returned them. 1. The tpu on the sides was not enough for lateral stability. If you do lots of sprint and things like skater lunges if feels like your foot will slip out the shoe. And it was too low on one shoe. It was like 2-3 mm on the left and .5-1 mm on the right.  I really really liked them, if the upper was a little more durable or atleast had more sidewall stability in the toe area, they would be the perfect workout shoe.",4
granger,Runs a bit tight,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21XLGM9KZA5M1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNRY4CB9,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 11, 2024",Size: 12.5Color: Black/Grey,Verified Purchase,It's not for me but it seems like a well made shoe. I'd size up about a half size. I'm used to Altra and Xero which are zero drop. The 4 mm drop is small but just didn't work for me. The toe box is a bit narrower than the standard Altra fit but comparable to Xero. More cushioning than Xero and less than Altra. Upper has a nice sock like fit with good support.,2
