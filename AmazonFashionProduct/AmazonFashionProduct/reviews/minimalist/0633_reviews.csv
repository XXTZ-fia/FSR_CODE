Had to dig for it too.  It fronted like it returned in full until I investigated.  Very shady.  It says free returns,  clear as day.  The shoe was nice enough in the hands, but ran big and felt awful and lumpy on my feet.  Would have gladly tried a smaller size but even for a replacement,  they were going to charge me full price and not honor the prime day price.  now disappointmented in both companies.",

Cris2pur,Comfortable but a bit pricey.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34MIPO509RB4B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CN4SDPD,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2025",Size: 9Color: Faded Black,Verified Purchase,Order took more than a month to arrive but it was worth it. I have had problems with big brand shoes as they are too snug and my feet would hurt in them. I watched and read reviews for months before pulling the trigger on this pair. Most reviews recommend you break in on them but I walk barefoot in the house most of the time so it took me very little to get used to them. My heels lock in perfectly but there is plenty of room on the toes. You may want to avoid walking on gravel as the soles really transmit all those textures to the soles of your feet. I may get another pair but I will wait for a few months as these are quite expensive for my taste. I don’t even care if they match my clothes or not. I am too old to be worrying about fashion statements as I worry more about my health.,
soundsmith,sorry but the don't have a very wide toebox,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38A7USEEL3QL0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CN4SDPD,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 30, 2024",Size: 14Color: Lunar,,"Eats my pinky toe. I am used to wearing Altras and was looking for a more minimal, less cushiony and cheaper alternative. Everything they say about the importance of ground feel and foot splay is true, too bad they don't even allow this with their own product!  Pros: I really like the lockdown on these and the ground feel. Also they look great! Con: The toebox is maybe wide for narrow feet but not mine and doesn't allow the toes to splay as advertised, in fact my pinky toes have sores on them now. I'd rather pay more for an actual wide toebox. Free your toes!",

I've always seen them and thought they were more of a novelty than anything actually helpful, but after a few of my coworkers told me that I should try them out...I did.  Pros: They're a lot more comfortable than I give them credit for. It's a nice true to size fit. They're really lightweight and I don't really feel like I have them on sometimes. Posture is getting better and my lower back feels better when I wear these.  Cons: Knees hurt to the moon the first few weeks I wore them. I could only wear them for short periods of time before I had to take them off. Due to have no arch or any real support, going from this shoe back to regular shoes throws my balance off a bit sometimes. If you plan to walk a lot in these, REALLY get used to them first or you'll be in a world of hurt later.",2

I decided to give these a try and I'm glad I did. They are extremely comfortable and didn't require a ton of breaking in to reach that comfort level. The lacing system makes these perfect for my narrow feet because it helps apply even pressure across my entire foot instead of just the top and sides of my feet like a lot of other shoes I've worn. They are very durable and have amazing grip and slip resistance as well. I've worn these while rucking and haven't experienced any issues transitioning from dry pavement to wet grass and back. I also haven't experienced any issues transitioning from wet pavement to the smooth concrete used inside arenas. Speaking of arenas, these have to be one of the most versatile shoes I've owned because they work perfectly as exercise shoes and also pair extremely well with a casual outfit for a night out. I give these a 9.9/10 recommendation.",4

Unfortunately what ultimately made me want to return these was the fit. The toe box on these is just too narrow for me coming from my Whitins. These fall somewhere in between wide toe box and regular toe box shoes but lean towards wider of course. I went up half a size but then the shoes just felt too loose. Probably for some people it’s perfect but I just didn’t feel like these lived up by what was being advertised (I was bombarded by their marketing on Instagram). I’m gonna check out other brands now but I’m pretty bummed that they didn’t work out!

The product is completely faulty, unusable, unless you plan to use the shoes on carpet.  In addition, Xero has probably one of the worst customer services, or rather it's non-existent.

I've have feet problems for years so I stopped running and moved to cycling and kayaking. I'm in better shape then most men 40 years younger then me with no extra weight. I've been wearing highly padded trail running shoes with arch insoles and my feet keep getting worse. Stretching and exercising makes them feels good but doesn't solve the problem. So for the last few weeks I have been going barefoot whenever possible and wearing real barefoot shoes. (Not all those that are called barefoot are barefoot shoes) In the short time I've been wearing barefoot shoes my feet have greatly improved.  PROS: As far as looks go the all black pretty much looks like regular sneakers with flat heals. The black is perfect for the office. The sole is zero down. Very thin sole especially when you remove the 2mm flat insole. Laces up nicely but I still ordered tie-free shock laces so they can slip on and off. Expensive but not as bad as some other recommended brands. Good grip but they do squeak. Seems to be very well made. Wide toe box but not as wide as some other brands. Overall comfortable.  CONS: Still too expensive for minimalist shoes. Many reviews complain that they fall apart easily so dependability may be an issue. I will update this review only if they fall apart early.  I'm hoping these work out well. I've been wearing the same New Balance model for over 20 years, replacing them every couple years and I'll do the same with the Xero Prio if they hold up. These will not be used for running or hiking.  Highly recommended",33

William,"Ok shoe, not my favorite Xero.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YQNPHU29KF6H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CN4SDPD,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 15, 2024",Size: 11.5Color: Black,Verified Purchase,I bought these shoes in August and they were not my favorite. I decided I would use them as my gym shoe and not wear them for much else. After only 10 or so wears the shoe started to separate from the sole and I have just not worn them as much. I bought the Speed Force about a month after purchasing these and love them! The Prio just did not work for me.,
Margarita Loaiza,Very slippery shoes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BFZ3F5KVTTWD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09CN4SDPD,"1.0 "," the United States "," June 12, 2024",,,"I dont recommend them. Dangerous, slippery on any surface and xero shoes told me i had to sandpaper or concrete worn them😒 So sad  They told me this after i did buy them:  We do have one style that is certifiably slip resistant - the Prio All Day SR. Although, we are currently out of stock of many sizes. It doesn't look like we'll be getting more of those until the first of next year but I think this would be your best bet for a totally non slip shoe. Besides the Prio All Day SR, we've seen customers use sandpaper or concrete to scuff up the bottoms of their shoes to make them more slip resistant  That was not my plan Sorry",
