I have wide feet and have been wanting to get barefoot type shoes for a while but didn’t want to pay a lot. These are great quality for the price. Since the toe box is made to fit naturally I was able to “size down” to my normal size 8 instead of when I get vans and have to size up. I bought these for a trip to Costa Rica so I can hike in them but wanted shoes that were ok if they got wet. I will say you can feel rocks if you are stepping on gravel. Nothing bad but more of that barefoot type feeling but they feel great. There is a little cushion on the back part of the shoe which make them so comfortable and you don’t need to break them in. I got the black with the white trim and they were cute. I’m sure more expensive barefoot shoes are nicer but for someone needing them quickly and wouldn’t be bummed if something would happen to them these are the shoes.,3

I imagine if you truly have wide feet or bunions with no other swelling, these would be fine, as long as you aren't expecting arch support.  However, the tongue is sewn to the top in both shoes, despite having full laces, and the top portion of the shoe does not have the vertical stretch I needed it to.

I have nothing similar to compare these to but I can say that I like them. Definitely roomy and light. They have cushion behind the heel which I didn't expect. Hard to tell if I truley like the cushioning because these are atleast half a size big on me.  All in all, these are worth a shot if you've never tried shoes like this before and don't want to spend a ton of money on some big brand. I'm definitely going to keep wearing these, these are my new staple walking shoes.",5
LNL,Very very basic,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNJJRF56C0VDU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGFZQNHY,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 27, 2024",Size: 9 WideColor: Black,,"My dayjob has me walking all over the place so I saw this and thought ""walking shoes! just what I need!"" and here's my takeaway so far!  Materials? Construction? The whole thing feels cheap; its materials are thin (which made it easy to ship at least? makes it affordable) and at first the shoe felt like its 'parts' were shifting beneath my feet as I walked. They remind me of moccasins? but not with the durability of leather. These also barely even have a tongue - even the laces feel cheap. And support? what support? I thought these were for walking, but I felt the sudden difference in these compared with any shoes that have good insoles. Definitely not meant for long days on your feet! is this how walking shoes normally are? at least they are very lightweight.  Okay, what about style?! They're not particularly stylish or good looking but not hideous. I feel on closer inspection, they definitely show their price if you know what I mean? but no parts are fraying or poorly seamed so that's good. I got mine in black and it works okay. They pair well with ankle socks.  Are they at least wearable? Sure! they fit just right, and the flexible siding really helps with that. That is very nice for me, sometimes I feel my feet are so difficult to size, but these worked with them just right. The flexible mouth means, I can't just slip them on hands-free and I don't like that. But on the bright side it means, less bugs at my ankles and stones in my shoes, because the shoe's mouth wraps around my ankle very nicely. Like many cloth shoes its very breathable (have some sense, don't wear it in the rain). I suspect they would wash & dry easily too but haven't done that yet, it can shorten a shoe's lifespan if you do it too much too rough.  Overall, I'm 'okay' with them - really the fact that they fit me just right is such a nice thing for me, but if this isn't usually a problem for you they wouldn't be my first choice.",11

So much room for my toes and you can flex them easily. Really like wearing them, even though they look a bit funny on your feet.",

I wear Rockport sandals for 75% of the year--until it gets below about 35 degrees  F--and my toes feel like they're going to fall off.  I'd wear them 100% of the year if I could.  Since  it will eventually get too chilly for that in the lower MidWest, I need to have other shoes that can keep me moving.  I've tried all the major brands & have spent unGodly sums on shoes that make my entire foot go numb.  (I have an uncommon type of neuropathy in both hands & both feet, and most lace-up shoes press in  just the right spot to make the top of my feet go numb--the bottoms are partially numb all the time, and certain shoes can make them completely numb & have that awful burning, pins & needles sensation.)  I also have Plantar Fasciitis, so that adds another level of complication when looking for shoes.  Back to these shoes--they didn't make the tops of my feet go numb--and they might be the only lace-up shoes I've been able to wear in the last 6 years that didn't do that.  The bottoms of my feet stayed numb in their normal places, but it didn't make the bottoms burn or prickle.  I really liked the wide toe box & felt like my feet weren't cramped in any way.  To me, looking down at them on my feet, I felt like my feet looked wider in them, but my daughter didn't think they look that way at all.  Also, because these are barefoot/zero drop shoes, there is virtually no padding in the bottom.  So, I was able to wear them for a bit around the house, but I'm probably going to have to add some sort of padding in there in order to be able to keep them on for longer without hobbling.  I like these better than the other barefoot/zero drop shoes I have because of the roominess & lack of extra loss of sensation in my feet.  If they had more padding & a little arch support in the footbed, while still keeping the roominess of the toe box, they'd be nearly perfect for me.  As a side note, if you're looking for shoes with arch support, these are NOT the ones you want unless you'd be okay with adding an insert that has arch support built into it.  I'm pleased so far & will continue to wear them & tweak them a little.  If my opinion changes over time, I'll come back & update this review.",5

I got the purple color and it is a light pinkish purple. The white laces contrast the purple color and look good. These are minimalist shoes so they are slim and not chunky. They have a wide rounded toe box. They are comfortable for my bunion. They come with an insole that provides a little bit of cushion especially in the heal. Like most zero drop shoes they take some adjustment to walk in. The first time you wear them you may feel some strain in your feet and calves. They came slightly wrinkled in the front. Good summer shoe.,

Ladies, take care of your feet while you're young, I wish I had done a better job.Today, as a 50yo woman, I have wide flat feed, bunions, hammer toes, and recently found out I also have OA and it doesn't help that I'm a heavy person.  Due to the issues I have on my feet, my choice in shoes are very limited.  I can't wear anything that puts pressure on the sides of my feet, the slightest pressure hurts.These shoes are soft and super wide at the front and are made of a stretchy material.  If I raise my toe, you can see the impression through the material.  The inside is somewhat soft, not the softest but they're not uncomfortable either.  The back of the ankle area has soft padding and they go on really easy.  Soles are flat and not very thick so it really does feel like you're walking barefoot.  Personally, I can't walk barefoot but I'm able to do so wearing these shoes.  They don't provide much support either, considering they don't have support and the sole isn't very thick, I'm able to walk with these comfortably.  As far as looks, I don't think they would win any beauty contest but if you're looking for comfort over looks, these should do a decent job.As far as the size, I say they are true to size.  I put my foot on a measuring tape and the tip of my foot was right at 9.5, that's what I ordered and they are perfect.",10

But they are well ventilated and bendable, and not unattractive -- I got black, which works with everything, and they feel good on my feet. So many sneakers these days are huge and clunky, and I don't love that heavy feel or that aesthetic. These are almost like slippers. That said, I'm not sure if there's enough support for regular walking outside of the house. They also run a little big, so you may want to size down.",
