The shoes are much too big. Unfortunately I can't return them so I'm stuck with them.. The shoe itself feels nice and supportive on the food. You kind of can feel the underlying ground more with normal shoes (maybe that's why they're advertised as barefoot?) but it doesn't completely feel like walking barefoot. When I tried to put them on without opening the laces the material at the back made a weird sound so my advice would be to be careful when putting them on (use a shoe horn or open the laces).  Overall, the shoes are just okay. Make sure to check out the size chart in the product description becomes I feel like the shoes are rather longer than usually (even though they're only advertised as wide which shouldn't affect the length).",4

They're definitely wide, I usually go up a size for shoes because of my wide feet but I was able to order half a size smaller because of the wide toe box. There isn't much padding, somewhat similar to a barefoot shoes, which could be an issue for some people but I like personally. The shoes also don't weigh much which is nice, and they are very comfortable to wear.  Make sure that you size correctly though, as the laces are mostly just decorative, these are slip-on shoes that need to fit snugly.",

I use them as work from home shoes.  I have 3 types of these style shoes from various manufacturers and this pair has the most heal comfort.  The toe box does not collapse which I read is common for these style shoes at this price point.I wore them outside on my electric scooter and took a low speed spill that tore a 1 inch hole in the top of my sock but I cannot find any damage to the fabric on the shoe.  So I was pretty impressed with that durability because I slid about 3 feet and crashed my goretex jacket.I also like the material on the heal which I use to step on with one foot and pull off the shoe.  This will help reduce wear taking the shoes off.  They are easy to go on but aren't slip on.  They require you to thumb on the shoe, which is OK by me.  They go on and off easy and you don't need to tie them once they are laced up once.  But they aren't hands free slip on and off.",5
RangerY,"Great for foot health, wide toe box, breathes, low profile soles, very bendy bottoms",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R355VO99UPJO7Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSSWKL39,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 4, 2024",,,"I absolutely love these shoes. To be honest I wasn’t expecting much, but I was looking for shoes with a wider toe box and a thinner sole to improve general foot musculature. Just to be clear, I have no health problems with my feet, and I usually wear a “D” or normal width shoe. The online ad describes the shoe as ""wide"". Usually ""wide"" dress shoes, (E which is wider that D) don't fit me. These shoes fit just fine, with the extra room for movement I was looking for. This first thing I noticed about these shoes when I put them on is how comfortable and snug they are. Part of this stems from the fact that the uppers are a knit woven fabric (polyester?). The knit fabric is heavy duty and the closes resemblance would be to the British motoring caps made of knit polyester since the 1970s. Because the upper is knit, the fabric is soft and it breathes. Second in the back of the shoes around your Achilles tendon and your ankles there is inside the shoes a stuffed soft tube like “collar.” This “collar” wraps around your ankle and this piece combined with the stretching upper around the shoe opening makes the shoe hold snuggly on your foot. In putting on this shoe, it is a slip-on shoe. You could not describe it as a “hands-free” slip-on; but, it only takes a slight effort to easily insert my index finger into the shoe to ease my foot into it. The bottom sole of the shoe is a “flat” profile which is very beneficial to foot health. The sole material is a kind of plastic/rubber that gives a cushioning feel, but is extremely bendy. This feature is in line with the shoe aiming to be a minimalist shoe. This means that you will be able to “feel” more of the ground and flex and move more of the muscles in your feet, which is critical to foot health. Movement means more flexibility equals a contribution to falls prevention. These features combined with the wide toes box means this shoes focuses on health. It feels very comfortable as well. The quality of construction is first rate. I plan to buy another pair in a different color.",5
J. Asher,Very Nice and Comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16IDDF155VHKH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSSWKL39,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 3, 2024",Size: 9 WideColor: Dark Grey,,"I ordered these shoes to wear for work, as we're expected were shoes that fit within the business-casual atmosphere, which eliminates sneakers from the mix.  These shoes are nice and wide, which I appreciate, because I do have wider feet. In fact, I tend to wear a size 8.5, but I typically go with a size 9 to allow for extra room for my feet to spread out. Unfortunately, these did not come in an 8.5 size, so I ordered my usual 9, and while these do fit alright, I kind of wish I had tried a size 8, as they are bit more roomy than my typical shoes, given their wider width. I can't say that these look or feel too big, and they certainly don't look like they're too big at all, so I'm still very pleased with them.  These shoes did not come packaged in a typical shoe box; instead, they were sealed in a plastic bag, with some plastic banding around them to hold them together. This was a bit odd, as far as packaging choices go.  The shoes are not a rigid type of shoe, being entirely cloth, other than the outer sole and plastic lace eyes, so I was afraid that these would look collapsed on my feet, making them appear sloppy, but I think that, because my feet are wider and higher-arched, my feet fill them out nicely, making them keep their shape. However, I would say that smaller feet, or feet that don't actually need the extra width would probably allow these shoes wrinkle up while wearing them, making them look too big.  I had read other reviews of these mentioning the lack of arch support, causing foot pain, which did give me pause, because I typically need a bit of extra support, due to my higher arches, but I have not found these to be lacking in this area for me; I can wear them comfortably all day.  The shoes look very nice while wearing them, and they slip on and off very easily. The shoe strings are not really there for function so much as they are there for looks, as the shoes are meant to slipped on and off; however, the strings likely can tighten the shoes up a bit if they feel a little too relaxed on your feet, though I would say that tightening the strings too tight would probably cause the shoes to bunch up and look awful.  Overall, I really like these shoes, and may order the size 8 in a different color to give them a try and see if those fit and feel even better than these. Otherwise, these are doing the job quite nicely.",4

I will include packing these lightweight shoes on my summer travels. The good looking breathable knit fabric uppers will really help with keeping your feet cool on those hot summer days.,
