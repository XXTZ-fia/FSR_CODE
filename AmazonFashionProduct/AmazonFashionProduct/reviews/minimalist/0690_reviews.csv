It’s especially good that it has RFID protection built in to safeguard bank cards from being compromised. The size is compact and the leather and construction make it very attractive, likely to wear well over time, and a great value for the money. This wallet would make a nice gift.",

Michelle,Talk about nice!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12LE21VRBW0W9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CL75975M,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 7, 2024",Color: Dark Brown,,"This wallet is everything I love about leatherwork.  First off, it’s gorgeous with a deep brown, smooth leather feel that is not stiff, yet not overly supple.  This wallet has ten (10!) slots — 2 for bills, 6 for credit cards, and 2 inside slots for whatever you choose.  The bill slots are lined with brown material and separated by a nylon cloth divider.  It comes in a simple, sturdy, cardboard box, encased in a linen envelope. Opening the wallet, you can smell the leather, though the smell is not overpowering.  I could not find one single error in the stitching. It’s perfect.  It is simple and functional, while being on the slimmer side.  To me, a nicely worked piece of leather is its own art form, and this wallet strikes me as art does. I think it’s gorgeous.  Highly recommended.",
Justamere Reviewer,A very good wallet; size is larger than some may be accustomed to,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VNO7484P2TZ9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CL75975M,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 28, 2024",Color: Dark Brown,,"I really enjoy the composition and seeming durability of this wallet. It comfortably fits all the cards & cash I need to carry around, and fits comfortably in my back pocket, as well. It's slim and folds seamlessly, even with everything in it that I typically carry around. I've used it daily for a couple months now and it shows not even the slightest intimation of wear or snagging. Good construction, good design -- not much more I could ask for honestly. Only thing of note; the size was slightly wider than I was accustomed to with my previous billfold, but that's not a big deal at all. Just take a thorough glance at dimensions before buying.",

Jack's Facts ... and Opinion,This Awesometik Slim Minimalist Mens Bifold Leather Wallet has a low profile in the front pocket,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DYDRL3DR8JO5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CL75975M,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 14, 2024",Color: Dark Brown,,"This Awesometik Slim Minimalist Mens Bifold Leather Wallet has a pleasing low profile in the front pocket.  This wallet is of my favorite design, with six visible card slots, two internal slots directly behind them, and two bill pockets (or one bill pocket with a divider if that is your perspective).  The leather seems decent enough, and the materials are relatively thin, which helps to make the wallet more flexible and comfortable.  I will only be using one bill pocket for cash, and the other for receipts and other temporary items.  I usually carry six cards, with identification and vehicle registrations hidden in those inside pockets.  It's difficult to know how long a product will last these days, but I'm optimistic after using it for about a month.  This wallet is slightly larger in length and width than other wallets so it would probably also accommodate larger Euro denominations, but that extra material around the edges only helps to prevent it from pushing itself open while holding US currency when slightly overloaded.",

Not only did I need to replace my old one, it was time for a different color. This is made with a relatively cheaper version of leather, but it’s still genuine if that is of any concern to you. The slots for credit cards are a tad wider than my old wallet, which makes it easy to slide them out. What could’ve made the difference in rating from four to five stars is if it came with an identification sleeve. On the whole, I am sure this wallet will survive the elements of my pockets for a decent two years at least. Given its price point, this is the minimum I’d expect it to last. Good value!  4 Stars",

My first impression of this is it's extremely stiff.  Like almost rock solid stiff.  You would think something made from high-quality leather would be softer, similar to the dozens of wallets I've used myself over the past half century, but it's not.  At least not now, maybe over a few weeks of use it will soften up?  Either way, he's not wanting to use it since he doesn't wear jeans.  He wears sweatpants and other similar types of pants where he will need to put his wallet in his front pocket.  So far this wallet he definitely cannot use in his front pocket.  I now have it empty, and keeping it in my own back pocket to try and soften it up for a while before he can use it.  I'll update if I can get it to be softer.  It does have slots for credit cards and drivers licenses or ID cards, and the cash part is good and deep.  Another thought I just had was I hope if it gets wet it doesn't bleed the color through.  We'll see.",

The Awesometik Mens Bifold Leather Wallet mostly avoids this tendency and stays with the item, avoiding exaggeration. The 5 headings about the Awesometik give correct details in each area, so the person looking for a wallet themselves or as a gift will not be disappointed upon receiving it. Here are the headings, with the reviewer’s comments:  Genuine Leather: Oh yeah ! This wallet is so smooth to the touch, so unflawed, it seems like the touchstones of old, able to be stroked to calm the nerves and induce good feeling. Inside and out, the claim for craftsmanship cannot be denied. No bumps, no snaps, not even a company tag. Perhaps the creator was named On Lee PerfecSheown and wants his/her work to speak for itself. It does.  RFID protection: Radio Frequency Identification, a useful tool in some industries, brought to the alleys of crime by thieves who can pick up credit card numbers in nearby wallets or bags and start racking up a nice collection of stolen objects, on somebody else’s dime. Amazingly, the Awesometik shows no signs of the protection it contains, but it has it and really offers a seamless security in a thin wallet loaded with finesse.  Versatile and functional: 3 license and credit card size slots with a tuckaway compartment under each side of the bifold ( 6 slots, 2 compartments altogether ). Two horizontal bill slots extend from side to side of the Awesometik, behind the card holders. No zippers or bulky seams to disturb the athletic slimness of this light brown beauty.  Resilient and long lasting:this sweet leather will stand up to daily use and only grow more appealing with time.  Timeless and stylish & Great gift idea: Yes, timeless – a man of means or a proud son could have carried one years ago or in 2024. Yes, stylish – doesn’t need to be laden with design but it shows it inherently, with its slim profile and easy handling. Yes, Great gift idea – somehow love figures in on this gift, regardless of the relationship in the giving.  “ Fancy Schmancy,” one might say as they satisfactorily tuck the Awesometik in their pocket, briefcase or backpack, confident about their transactions and finances.",

The only concerns I had initially were tied to shape, and whether it would soften with use.  Happy to say it did soften, and conformed to how I'm using it, without losing structural integrity. It now reminds me of the pricier name brand I replaced, when the older wallet finally wore out.  Five stars!I ordered this to replace my old wallet, which was also a leather bi-fold.  This one holds cards and IDs tightly, and does have a mild, pleasant, leather smell.  It doesn't seem terribly flexible, although I suspect it'll break in with time.  I left it one star short of five due to the lack of flexibility, and that my keys created an indent in the leather, though again, I think it will become more supple with time.  If not, I may try some leather conditioner on it.  So far, so good, and I'm one who tends to be pretty picky about items like this.  Thank you!",
