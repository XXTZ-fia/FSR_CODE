Small and very functional. It is true that cards can slip out of it easily -BUT- it is a matter of understanding how to use the wallet. Learn how to release the elastic strap so the wallet stays in the upright position. As long as it is upright the cards can't fall out. Also it works well to carry alot of bills. I have used one of these wallets for over 2 years with no problems.,

I used to have a leather front pocket which was basically a leather rectangle that wrapped around my cards but it wasn't made to hold paper bills. This new nylon wallet holds the same amount of cards more securely and can carry bills too. It also fits in the front pocket.  The one issue I've had with it is the credit card pockets don't hold a small amount of cards securely. You need about 5+ cards per pocket or the cards might easily slide out when the wallet is 'open'. When 'closed' the elastic band wraps around and keeps everything secure but in the beginning I had just a few cards in one of the pockets and they all fell out. I rearranged my cards and it's secure now.,

The organization is intuitive, making it easy to access my cards quickly.  The **trifold design** is a great feature. It provides extra security for my cards and cash, and I love how compact it feels. The **nylon material** is both durable and lightweight, ensuring that the wallet will last a long time without adding unnecessary weight to my pocket.  One of the standout features is the **RFID blocking technology**. It gives me peace of mind knowing that my cards are protected from electronic theft. In today's world, this is an essential feature that can't be overlooked.  In addition to its practical features, the **stylish design** of this wallet is another big plus.

Especially the ones listed on Amazon, every time I get a new wallet I scroll dozens of pages into the listings before coming to a decision. I started out as a front-pocket wallet guy and continue to be one so the big wallets didn't usually last very long. They all had flaws, which I'm sure this one does, but I don't think any of them were quite as space-efficient as this one.  I can't talk much about its longevity or durability since I haven't owned it for very long, but I expect I'll probably experience the same logo stitching issue like everyone else. Still, it's a fantastic little wallet and cheap enough that I could just get another one. I carry a small amount of cash because as much as I'd like to go without it, cash is still king in some places. I've loaded about 15 cards into it with three bills in the cash slot and it's about as small as it could possibly get. I keep my ID in the top of the stack in one column, and my two most used cards at the top of the other two columns and I have quick and easy access to the three cards I need on a daily basis.  I noticed that I don't have anywhere to put two restaurant's buy-15-get-one-free-type paper punch cards in. I could put it in the wallet like any other card but I decided to just leave them out and hopefully remember to bring them along when I go. I doubt I will, though. Oh well.",

One of my cards that never even left my wallet was picked up on the first trip I took using this wallet. With all or most cards having RFID for contactless payments, the lack of this feature on any modern wallet is a big blow to it’s usefulness. I normally use RFID sleeves but those don’t fit on this wallet. I do NOT recommend purchasing it.  Literally one day after I opened it, the elastic band is starting to tear. That's unfortunate as the size of this wallet and the amount of cards and cash it can take (I'm doing 10 cards and 12 bills), while keeping an amazingly small footprint is impressive. I'm still going to use it for as long as the elastic lasts, but this means the $17 price tag comes with a catch and that is poor quality, at least in the elastic band. Also, it says that it offers RFID protection, but I heard on a video review on Youtube that it's just nylon, no additional shielding in between layers. Which if true, not sure how good nylon is for that purpose. I normally carry my cards in RFID protective sleeves, but none of them would fit in the card pockets of this wallet. If they had a more expensive version of this wallet with better quality materials and a proper RFID shielding layer built it, I would get that instead. I'll just say that if you really want a compact wallet but have to carry a bunch of cards and some cash, you won't find a better option than this wallet. Just know that the materials are not the best and may not last as much as you'd like.",3
