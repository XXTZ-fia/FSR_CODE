AMH,Great barefoot starter shoe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7HAZX3LVEW3H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D54VHG6Q,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",Size: 7.5Color: Storm,Verified Purchase,"If you’re looking to rabbit hole down the barefoot shoe thing, then these are a great start! They’re reasonably affordable compared to many brands so you can try them out without feeling too guilty on the money spent. Once I started wearing these regularly and I went back to others I couldn’t believe how much my feet really “feel” and it does make a difference! I plan to try more of their shoes and even branch out into some other brands. I will say they didn’t hold up quite as long as some of my other shoes. There’s just the slightest peeling of shoe from sole. But not enough to make me stop wearing them and I still give it a good rating despite this. There’s no arch support but that’s obviously intentional and I didn’t have any issues. These are more comfortable than my Birkenstocks because they MOVE!! O wakes all day the zoo and had no trouble! And I used to have terrible arch pain. If you haven’t rabbit holed down the barefoot movement go to Anya’s Reviews and read all about it. It just makes sense when you look at X-rays of conventional shoes vs barefoot! Give em a try!",

My pinky toe gets caught under my other toe and usually ends up with a blister.  What I noticed right away is that there is absolutely no cushioning in these shoes, none.  I went and bought a pair of Dr. Scholl's inserts at the drug store hoping they would help.  They didn't.  My husband and I went on a 4 mile walk.  It's pretty flat and a paved pathway.  About a mile in my heels we're hurting and the bottom of my foot was aching.  It only got worse as the walk went on.  When we got back to the car it was a short drive home and by the time we got there my heels did not want any pressure on them at all and my calves were aching.  I will be returning this pair as well.  I'm disappointed because the toe box is roomy and my pinky toe had an easy time of it.  Unfortunately the rest of my foot didn't.",

I took the tip that someone gave of not over tightening them and I agree. Just let your foot move freely. Tighten enough for your foot not to slip out. Sizing was different, a 7 was perfect gave my toes plenty of room length wise (i have long toes), but I'm normally a 6.5.",

They give stability and comfort. The wide toe box is an absolute delight for my toes. I play hardcourt volleyball in them and cannot recommend them enough to anyone who's thinking about minimalist shoes for volleyball. I was concerned about the cushioning of my feet (heel area) when jumping and landing and the extra space for my toes felt like the shoe would be loose but have absolutely no issues. My feet don't hurt any more after playing volleyball for 3 hours. I have the feeling that running and jumping in them has improved. Amazing shoe!,
