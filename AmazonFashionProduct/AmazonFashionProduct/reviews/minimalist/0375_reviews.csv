Jaycee @ Discover Trendy Finds,They run small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P5QPK3EXQIMH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJ6LH74K,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2025",Size: 8.5 WideColor: A All Black,Verified Purchase,I like the quality of the shoe.

Reason for the lower star rating is two-fold. The heel is very stiff which makes them hard to get on. The laces are long and don’t stay tied very well. However, I have flexibility issues in my knees and can’t bend down to put these on and keep them tied. So if you are more “bendy” than I am, you might love these. I’m keeping them in my car for extra shoes in case my regular ones are out of commission.",

Sally M.,"Wow, I'm impressed",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YFUO5D9C195/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJ6LH74K,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",,,"I had a knee repair surgery two years ago and have really struggled to learn to walk again. I was on crutches for two months between the injury and surgery and then non-weight bearing for another two months. I forgot how to walk, y'all. I mean, my muscles were in a state of total amnesia. I used to wear high heels, cowboy boots and all kinds of fun shoes. I had one pair of slip-on tennis shoes that I could wear that would support my feet and not cause me to trip, as I learned to walk again. I am pretty much recovered and have few issues with walking. But there are days that my knee hurts a bit. I swim several times a week and do strength training, and on those days, my knee hurts a bit. I was advised by trainer to try barefoot shoes. I did research and, when I saw the chance to get these, I was excited. I am so glad I did. These are so easy to walk in. I don't feel the strain inside my knee when walking a lot, as I did before. I also feel less burden when I lift my feet while walking. I have heavier shoes because these were the ones that I could slip on and also had really great non-skid bottoms. I felt safer in them. And I could put them on, lol. So, moving to other shoes was scary. But I am so glad I got these. They really are easy to walk in. The soles are non-skid. And they are not so heavy. I mean, I held one of my other shoes in one hand and one of these in the other and it was so obviously different. Both of these shoes weigh less than the one shoe I usually wear. I have found less fatigue on my knees at the end of a day, and less strain on the arch. It's like walking barefoot, which really is my most comfortable way to walk. These are really awesome shoes and at more than half the price of others I looked at. I also love that I can wash them - just toss in washer and dryer and they are good to go. Love them.",
Allison,So comfy!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VJ5MOQ0FH3RT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJ6LH74K,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: 8 WideColor: B White,Verified Purchase,"These shoes are incredibly light and wide. They’re ridiculously comfy. I’m a staff nurse on an IMCU so I have up to 6 patients that require some pretty constant care so clock 15k steps at work a day usually and my hips/feet still feel amazing at the end of the day. They do look a bit like the wide toe toddler shoes but you can’t beat the functionality. They seem to be great quality also, so I think they’ll last a while",
Caddy,TRUE TO SIZE HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37KUZN2Z7T0DS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJ6LH74K,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",,,"I wear a size 6.5-7 depending on the shoe style & ordered these in a 6.5 due to fact that they are “barefoot” shoes & they are a perfect fit! All of the fabric on the shoe including the tongue of the shoe are one single piece so you never have a twisted tongue or it slipping inside the shoe when your trying to put them on or any of those other factors. They fabric is breathable & the insoles are soft. I don’t have any foot issues but I can say that these would be perfect for people who have feet problems such as ingrown toenails or bunions because there’s no constricting areas inside the shoe & they are quite roomy. They are really comfortable & because how they are made in one single piece of fabric., you don’t have to tie the laces & could tuck them inside the shoe if you prefer. They are easy to slip on & off your feet but are also secured perfectly to your feet when walking. I’m quite impressed with not only the design of these but also the quality & comfort. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",

Casey R.,Super impressed,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R116YTIU6TVJH0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJ6LH74K,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 2, 2025",,,"I haven't had good luck with off brand tennis shoes in the past, so I usually avoid ordering them. Well, I've wanted to try the barefoot type shoes, so I figured, why not? I waited quite some time for these to arrive, and they were worth the wait! They are SO comfortable. They have a deep footbed, so I left the thick insole they came with and I inserted my own custom insole on top of that (2 layers) and that made them extra comfortable. The deep footbed is a little too deep for my comfort without the extra insole, but that is personal preference. The toebed is decently wide, and my toes do not feel squished. Lengthwise, I think the sizing is dead on. I ordered a 37. Usually my foot is right at the end of a 37 and these are no exception. My toes reach right to the end. They are a perfect fit for me! I have a narrow to normal foot and the toebed is comfortable. As I mentioned, the length is just right. If I had a wide foot, I'm not sure if these would work, but I think that is also due to the fact that I have a double layered insole in the shoe. Without two insoles, I do think the width would be more accommodating to someone with a wider foot. These shoes are seriously more comfortable than another much more expensive brand I have tried. Anyway, I'm impressed with the comfort of these, and the look is sleek and subtle as well. Can't wait to try these out for sports like lifting and running and see how they do. After giving these shoes even more of a test run, I think I will come back and order more colors! Can't go wrong with the price.",

These shoes seem to be just as well made as the top manufacture's.  What people don't realize is that most of the name brand stuff comes from the same manufacturing facilities as brands like Adidas and Nike.  If they make a good product, the big brands will use them to make products under their brand.  That's the economy we live in.  China makes it and we buy it hand over fist.  The only thing we make in the USA are rules and movies.  These shoes are very comfy and the wife loves them.  Why spend more money on a name to get the same quality?  People better start wising up to what's going on.
