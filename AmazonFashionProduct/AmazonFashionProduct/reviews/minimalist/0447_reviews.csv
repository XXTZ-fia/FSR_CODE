Fit perfectly, so unbelievably comfy, and still zero-drop, which is the only thing I can use these days; the only type of footwear that doesn't cause a whole bevy of trouble for my feet.  I love zero-drop, or ""barefoot"", shoes. The only thing I've never really cared for was the decidedly unappealing looks that usually accompany them. They're usually fine for jeans or shorts or swimwear/beach attire. I don't usually mind them. But now that I can use no other type footwear, I was looking for a more ""stylish"" version. These shoes somewhat resemble ""Hey Dude"" brand shoes, have a wonderfully soft and cushy insole that may or may not be memory foam, and embrace the foot like a glove. They have laces which I appreciate, as I like the shoe around my foot to be snug. I realize the memory foam is not a true ""barefoot"" experience, but when walking on gravel (our driveway and the road on which we live), it is very appreciated. I like barefoot on trails and on sand. Not so much on pointed and jagged gravel.  Because they are so appealing to look at, I will likely order several pair--one for my daily walks on said pointy and ungainly gravel, and others to wear to church and grocery shopping. They're priced very well and so much more affordable than the high-dollar brands on line. Recommend!  PS There was one issue. The packaging was rough. They arrived rather mangled and bent out of shape. One of the pipings on the left shoe had torn loose. Easily fixed with E600 and a Q-tip, but one doesn't appreciate having to fix a brand new shoe. Still, all in all, these are definitely worth the price and will be a favorite for a while!",10

I usually wear the Whitins loafers for work and their sneakers for casual wear. I saw these and decided to give them a try since they looked like the Whitins but slightly different colors. I bought my regular size and they fit fine. But I did notice that they aren't as wide, despite being a wide size, which is fine for short term use but after wearing them all day you really feel it. I also noticed that these have cushion, which isn't my problem, but they don't feel like they're zero drop. I kept banging my heel into the ground while walking as if I was wearing regular shoes! So, I don't know if they're simply not zero drop or if they're just so cushioned that they feel like that have a raised heel. Either way I'll be sticking with Whiting for this style of shoe.",7

I wish they were the ultimate answer, but they did show that what I’m looking for will be found in a barefoot-style shoe like these. I had to downgrade the stars to a 4.  I’ve now had the shoes for months. I’ve hiked in them & worn them just about everywhere. My main objection is, still, that they don’t breathe.
