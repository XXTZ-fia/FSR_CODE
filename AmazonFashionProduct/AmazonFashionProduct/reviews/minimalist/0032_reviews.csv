Claudia Mandini,Tan cual lo que se ve,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QS53Z9SICYW1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BYVBDJL5,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 25, 2024",Color: Peat Moss,Verified Purchase,"Cuero puro. Su aroma inconfundible, pero amenos que se visualice para usarlo así, yo tengo la inquietud de idear, qué detalle distintivo le agrego. Puede ser un aro grueso dorado, con otro guindando y los cambio por plateados, según lo que utilice para vestir. Es como un toque de elegancia, ya que simple, como viene, predomina un minimalismo estéril. Sólo rompería eso, con un toque de ""nivel"".",

JM,Beautiful and minimalist,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNFEFQQ7TOYDS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BYVBDJL5,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2024",,,"This is a cute bag that fits with my style. I love the coloring of the leather and I can see myself using it when going out with friends.  Pros: -Beautiful coloring; I got the Bourbon Brown, and it matches the description well. -The size and shape of the bag is super modern and minimalistic, which is a great addition to any outfit. -Seems durable and long-lasting.  Cons: -The inner width of the bag is super small, so it can't hold much. Larger items also make it bulge out. -I understand that the leather/sheepskin will change color and marble with use and time, however, I was disappointed that the bag arrived slightly creased in some areas before use (which is unfortunately permanent).",
Elizabeth,WOW!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2H619DLTN34AF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BYVBDJL5,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 20, 2023",,,"The full-grain leather and sheepskin materials used to create this handbag are of the highest quality and the craftsmanship is exceptional. The minimalist design is both timeless and elegant, making it the perfect accessory for any occasion. The size is just right - not too big and not too small, and the interior is spacious enough to hold all of my essentials. I love the attention to detail, from the stitching to the hardware, it's clear that this handbag was made with care and precision. I highly recommend the TUZECH Minimalist Handbag - it's a must-have for any fashion-conscious woman who appreciates quality and craftsmanship. Insert Rephrase",

I absolutely love the deep green color! It is genuine leather too! Natural materials are always a preference for me. It is a bit small for my daily needs, and I do think the opening is rather narrow for using as comfortably as I would like. However, I love the look and make of it anyway!",
Marcus Darpino,"Nice leather, well-stitched, quite minimal design.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O5F0WKQKG86E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BYVBDJL5,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 8, 2023",Color: Peat Moss,,"This is good leather. Really seems like full grain, not top grain...which is GREAT. I'm acutely aware of leatherworking techniques and the stitching here should last a lifetime. At $30 MSRP, the leather alone is nearly worth it, the fact that it is assembled into useful item is a bonus.  Calling this a handbag is a bit of a misnomer. Is it a bag that can be carried by hand, yes. The word ""handbag"" however might make many think of a lady's bag. This is likely a poor choice for a woman's handbag. There are no inner pockets or pouches. No zipper compartments. All of your items will just sit in a pile inside this bag. If one intends on using this as a traditional handbag, I would suggest being prepared to supplement this bag with smaller pouches inside for each of your item categories (ie makeup, money, cards).",
Life Is Beautiful...,Horrible Muddy Green Colored Purse (avoid),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R316GU7QVOBHWP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BYVBDJL5,"1.0 "," the United States "," November 2, 2023",Color: Peat Moss,,"Let me say something positive first. This was true to size according to the listing and had no awful smells that sometimes accompany purses on arrival. It is convenient for carrying smaller things. A wallet, cell phone, lipsticks, notepad. The color wasn’t a brown or black is was this awful muddy green color and was mottled or blotchy looking like a weathering process that went poorly.  I’d say better quality control and accurate descriptions of color could clear up this problem.  I’d like to offer a higher review but am very disappointed with this item especially in light of the 5 star reviews it received from others!",
SleepyLark,Stunning oil-tanned leather handbag.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R58BHES1XN23Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BYVBDJL5,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 1, 2023",Color: Peat Moss,,"This is a stunning bag; lovely, well thought-out, minimalist  pattern.It does not have a clasp or any other metal fittings.. It is taller than wide and it is narrower at the top, with a wider base. The leather is also quite firm. Therefore, even if it falls  on its side, the chances of anything falling out are decreased. Besides, the base can and should be flattened - the stitching shows that that is how it is to be used. It then sits on that flat base, the leather being firm enough to hold that shape.. Since it is held in such a way that holding the handles keeps it closed, the lack of a clasp is not an issue. Of course, a degree of care is needed to ensure things remain inside but it is not a matter of everything spilling out the moment it is placed on a table.The leather is a lovely, dark green oil-tanned leather- chrome-tanned leather with a post-tanning treatment of oils and waxes. That gives it a rich patina and when it gets scratched, a rub usually removes those surface scratches. Being chrome-tanned, it does not have the delightful leather fragrance. Mine, in fact, had a faint chemically smell that was unpleasant. Airing it for a day decreased it substantially. It will need to be kept in the open, else the smell will probably reappear.  The smell is not sufficient to decrease the 5-star rating though. I am really delighted with this bag.",

Jeff T,"Unique leather handbag, good quality",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTUHUUL4W7Y9O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BYVBDJL5,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 24, 2023",,,"First off, this is a very different handbag. It is quite unstructured, meaning, I think it might be hard to keep standing upright, and therefore, you will need to watch what you put in it so your belongings don't fall out when the purse tips on its side. Knocking one star for that. Other than that, I like it. It is unique and nice off brown/tints of burgundy in it. It is soft leather and appears to be made with quality! I included some pictures with some items placed in the handbag so you can get a sense for the size of the inside bottom. If you're looking for a unique leather handbag, this might be it. I can't wait to show off to my friends to see what they think.",4

The leather quality is good - it smells like leather and doesn't have any weird chemical smell that I've had to deal with in the past with other items like this.  Stitching is well done.  Good leather - makes the handle soft and easy to hold.  Overall, it's a great quality item.  It's on the smaller size - you can see it next to a diet Coke can.

It has that leather smell, which I love. It is about the size of a standard lunch bag for adults, it’s not a large tote bag; it really is a small grab and go kind of thing. Think like a tote style clutch if you will? It’s easily carried in one hand by the handle. The inside is unfinished raw leather and there are no pockets at all. I think it’s cute and adds a great finishing touch, especially if you have an otherwise busy outfit, I just wish it had a snap or something inside to keep it closed just in case. You never know  What can happen if you drop the bag or something!",

It has no interior pocket. It is just 2 pieces of leather stitched together. The stitching in some places has 1/8” gap between it. The leather is stiff and not pliable. Though with time I bet it gets softer. I wish there was a small interior pocket for cash or license. When I run with a purse this small I don’t want the traditional trappings of a wallet etc. It is very pretty and it’s unique in shape. It’s also an excellent value.,
