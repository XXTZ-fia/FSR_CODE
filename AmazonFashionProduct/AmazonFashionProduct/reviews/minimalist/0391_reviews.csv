He tells me it's a pretty good shoe and lasted well enough considering all the physical labor he does at the warehouse. Granted already in the few shorts months of having it. It has been through the ringer on the rubber. Which has been grinded flat from walking and pushing on the concrete in the heat for roughly 6 hours a day and in the tire shop. Considering all he does. He did love the shoe and wanted the rubber to be a bit thicker to last.  Pros Comfortable Flat Zero drop breathe easy on the feet meant to be an everyday shoe not a work shoe.  Cons according to him Not meant for hard labor The zipper doesn't zip right anymore Rubber not meant for the hottest of days  All in all he rates it well enough to consider buying the not zipper form of the shoe.,2
