It takes me 3x as long to find and grab a specific debit card than it did with my regular wallet because there's no separation between your cards, they just get mashed together and you have to push all cards out just to grab one and then it takes more time to put all of them back in. The ease and efficiency as well as speed and organization of standard wallets are all lost here. It's supposed to look like the Ekster wallets or Ridge wallets, but those brands actually have separation between your cards or a way to isolate and choose which card you need without taking them all out",

My own tastes and requirements have changed over the years.  For where I am today, the Mountain Voyage is just about perfection.  I like its style, durability, and extreme minimalist design.  It seems to do just what I need and nothing more.  It may or may not be the wallet you are looking for, so let me say a few things about why I like it so much, and perhaps that will help you choose.The elastic bands let me carry six to eight cards in perfect security.  The cards are protected so the edges don't wear, and they will not fall out even if you shake it vigorously. I have lost a credit card by having it fall out of a rigid box wallet that was under-filled and do not want to have that experience again. So: perfect.It incorporates a money clip or cash strap, which can be removed or replaced as you like: integrated with the design, not an afterthought glued on to the back.  The capacity is right in line with the number of bills I want to have on hand in my everyday life.I am not keen on lever mechanisms that present the cards in a wallet.  They add bulk and weight and seem to always make it easier to lose cards or spray them out all over the counter.  With the Mountain Voyage, I push the cards out a bit with my thumb, and the one I usually want is right there on top.  If I need a different one, I find it's perfectly convenient to pull the stack of cards out another inch or so so I can pick through them.  It's not a difficult trick to master, and I call it a fair trade for the compactness and security.So, all in all: very happy.  If it seems like the wallet for you, give it a try.",2

I originally came across the ridge wallet, but I was put off by the price. This wallet is one third of the price yet seems to be every bit as good as far as function and durability go. I think the ridge uses metal plates instead of the hard plastic ones of this one (but I honestly thought they were both metal until I was rereading some of the reviews here!). The elastic bands have continued to hold up and perform like they are brand new, as well as the money clip, which has yet to get stretched out even with massive wads of cash. Ive also been fairly clumsy with this wallet and have dropped it plenty of times! The only problem I've really noticed is with the style of this wallet: your cards will get scraped up a lot faster. But I haven't had any of the cards actually stop working due to this. Needless to say, this is am excellent choice for a wallet, and it has blown away my expectations!",

This is the second of these minimalist wallets that I've bought. The design crushes the amount of space needed in your pocket. This is comfortable in a front pocket. It's a bit odd finding a random card but really I always put the one credit card that I almost always use on one side and it's easy to find. I carry 10 cards but most of them are not often used. If you always use one or two cards you can put them on the sides and you can find them easily, getting a random card basically means, pushing the cards out a bit with the finger dent and then taking all the cards out and sorting through them... maybe looking for an odd edge colored card can work. It's not quite as convenient looking for many cards but I don't do that often, and the small size and security makes it worth it. The cards are surrounded by metal so they are clearly RFID protected which was one of the features I was originally looking for with the small type wallet. I got the red one, a bit unique for me, I like that the color pops a bit when I'm looking for it on the counter.",
