I put my two most used cards in the two smaller pockets and the rest in the larger pocket.,

It holds about a dozen items in the wallet. The pull tab makes it very easy to access the most frequently used cards. I don't carry much cash anymore so it is not a problem but if you carry more than a few bills regularly, then the elastic that secures the cash may stretch out. I really like the minimalist feel of the wallet after using traditional tri-fold wallets my entire life. This wallet I usually carry in my front pants pocket and forget that it's there. I highly recommend this wallet.",
The smell is so good and it really does the job last the whole day literally but I’m b slightly disappointed because I  thought,I like that it has a place for coins,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CP09LB7UQJ8G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BTSZ7TS,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 21, 2024",Size: Suede LeatherColor: Powder Grey,Verified Purchase,I like this product it’s very minimalist and what I love about it that it can hold up to 15 card and the most important the it has a tray for coins,
TexApolis,Suede version = no pull tab and outside pockets are useless because of being too loose,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXTPPPZMAD7FO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BTSZ7TS,"1.0 "," the United States "," July 28, 2024",Size: Suede LeatherColor: Powder Grey,Verified Purchase,"I was replacing a worn out Trove wallet, which is what this brand has copied at a much cheaper price. My first complaint is also partially my fault. Watch out if you are wanting the pull tab version. There are two options, and the non-pull tab version is very difficult to get cards out of. I was really interested in the outside pockets (i.e. the ability to put things in between the external leather part and the elastic band, but there is not enough pressure/tightness to put anything here. Things like a key, fob, guitar pick slide right out because the slots are too loose, and this pocket is too small to be useful for alternative uses such as holding additional cards or cash.  So design on the non-pull tab version is a fail in my eyes, but the quality does seem good and is actually quite impressive at this price point. The quality has me debating ordering the pull tab version, but I am now thinking about just paying up on the Trove which runs 4x to get in the US but would be the right thing to do in support of the original innovator of this design.",2

It says 3 compartments, however, I count 5 compartments. I have 2 standard credit cards in the middle and one side compartment. The remaining side compartment, I have one credit card and 3 slimmer health insurance cards. I have 3 bills each on each outer band, the bills are folded in half 2x.

It covers your entire card so you're not flashing them around and it's easy to take cards in and out of thanks to the little pull tab. And since it's elastic, it's tight and nothing falls out.  I've been rocking this for around a year now and it has held up well. The only slight downside to this is it will slightly bend your cards to a slight curve over time, but I don't see that as a big deal.",

Who needs cash?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIXUCHNW0YT8P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BTSZ7TS,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 19, 2023",Size: Suede LeatherColor: Pure Black,,"I bought this wallet in November of 2016. I've used it continuously for six and a half years for every day use as well as for traveling.  It comfortably holds 8 credit / ID cards and a folded-up emergency bill in my front pocket.  It has held 10 cards when needed but 8 is kind of the sweet-spot.  If you look at the pictures you can see very little wear at all. It's so slim you don't get any wear from trying to squeeze it in and out of your pockets so it doesn't matter if you keep it in your front or rear pocket.  The pull tab is ingenious, it become second nature to pull out the wallet and tug on the tab, then my most used cards are right there. If you still don't have what you need, the cards are already half-way out of the wallet so it's easy to splay them to find the interior cards you need.  As for cash, I always keep a enough bills so I can deal with any amount needed under $100, but it's not unusual to be walking around with the same bills for months at a time as nearly everything can be done electronically. I just fold up the bills and keep them in another pocket. They don't need a clip or wallet to add bulk, they stay put with no issue.  Just in case I lose or forget my cash, there is a small pocket on the side opposite the tab where the same emergency $20 bill has been sitting since I got the wallet.  I still get the occasional comment on it when people see me pull it out to present my ID or buy something, sometimes I forget that those enormous inch-thick leather monsters that I remember from the 70's are still out there wrecking people's backs.  This wallet has held up extremely well and I couldn't be happier with it.",

I got this wallet as my ""pandemic wallet"", after the first year of the pandemic, because I was tired of carrying around my huge leather wallet in my bag, which would attract more covid germs... yes, i was that kind of neurotic person.  Well, it has served me well. It's not really a wallet that I care about, which makes it perfect. Right now I'm carrying 6 cards in it and my vaccination card folded in half. It's really nice to just be able to keep it in my pocket without it bulking everything up.  The only inconvenience that I was already aware of when buying it, was that I wouldn't be able to carry much cash. Maybe only one bill at a time. But I was ok with that, because I didn't want to touch dirty money during the pandemic!  By the way, I cut out the pull tab on mine because I found it to be annoying.  In the long run, I can see this wallet being stretched out too much, so I try to keep no more than 6 cards in it at a time. 7 if I really have to, but I make sure to remove it and store it elsewhere so that I don't wear out the elastic. Definitely only keep the essentials in here, which is probably a good thing because then you're not carrying around pointless clutter.",
