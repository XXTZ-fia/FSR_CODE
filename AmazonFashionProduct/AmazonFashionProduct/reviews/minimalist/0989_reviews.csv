I wouldn't call it small since the leather is kinda thick (but sturdy!), is a bifold wallet, and it doesn't really lie flat -- see pix. But I do think it is a minimalist wallet since its few pockets achieve the same purpose as a regular wallet. When you open the wallet, you have two slots on each side, one side has horizontal slots, the other has vertical card slots. Mine comfortably holds 6 cards, and it's still easy to take cards in and out. There is also a slit across the top that can hold cash. HOWEVER, you cannot fit American bills without folding them. I have to fold mine and insert them vertically to not add an extra fold. Since it cannot hold cash the regular way, I can use the other side of the cach pocket to hold other cards. After using it for a few weeks, I am getting creases in specific areas of the wallet that see a lot of movement, but it is not close to breaking or anything. The leather isn't too fragrant, which is a plus.  Thickness wise, it was 5/8 of inch or 16 mm with all of my items inside - 6 cards, several bills, and 3 cardstock loyalty cards.

I assume that, over time, things will wear out a bit and it will become easier, so not a big deal, just slightly annoying. Another note is that it's not long enough to hold USA bills in the traditional way that a bifold would. Instead, you have to fold them in half, more like a money clip would hold them. Once again, nothing terrible, just something to be aware of. Overall, if you like this style of wallet, I think it's definitely worth the money, and should hold up well for years to come.",

It’s an odd size and I knew before purchasing that the money slot would not fit American bills unless it was folded in half but even then, the money has to be stuffed in deep vertically to keep it from hanging out which isn’t convenient especially if its only a couple of bills. Also, because the rough side of the leather is on the inside of the card slots it acts like velcro which makes it cumbersome getting the card out quickly.

Kind of still has that raw leather feel to it. Nice stitching and looks like it will hold up for many years. Has plenty of room for cards and a little cash but really who carries lots of cash anymore. You can barely feel this is your back pocket. Overall nice package at a very nice price.,

That’s pretty much all it will hold, but that’s all I need. It won’t hold a dollar bill without folding it and won’t hold more than one or two. It’s small. The leather is nice and it’s well constructed.",

The leather is much thicker than in most wallets, the card and currency pockets lack the usual cloth lining, and there's no plastic ID cover.  Made entirely of strong leather, there's really nothing to wear out.  If you appreciate ""beausage"" (beauty through usage), you'll probably see this wallet gaining character as it ages.  I anticipate using it for a long time.",

YoungJin,Dollar bills do not fit in the wallet,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DFRXDCBSWVSL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BT1KHK1F,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 14, 2023",Color: Royal Blue,,"I was expecting to get soft leather wallet, but this is little too stiff. You have to put some force to actually make the cards to fit in.  The real problem is that the dollars bills do not fit in the pocket. As you can see in the photos, the length of the pocket is smaller than the bill itself. It requires you to squeeze the bills in, which is not ideal.  It looks fine and more premium from the outside.  Overall, I would use it as the wallet just to keep credit cards. If they can fix the issue with the bill, then it would be a better choice.",

Ivan Buruca,Premium feel for a GREAT price!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ2R2K5FKVJPC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BT1KHK1F,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2022",Color: Brandy,,"Was searching for a minimalist leather wallet made of Full-Grain leather and came across this wallet. I went ahead and purchased it without thinking much of it. Once I got the wallet it came in premium packaging (which makes it great for gifts) and included a card with more of their information on it. The wallet itself felt soft and supple giving that premium feel. The quality of stitching was also surprisingly really good! I tried to see if I could loosen the stitching by tugging the wallet here and there but it remained solid! The card inserts are a little tight at first but wear overtime. I really like this wallet because it prevents me from carrying unnecessary items and only the essentials like cash and cards. It is also very compact allowing me to carry it in my front pocket or my shirt pockets. Definitely has a small footprint and allows me to sit comfortably! The only “downside” is that it doesn’t have RFID protection which isn’t really a big deal, you can always buy a RFID blocking card to keep in the wallet. Other than that the wallet is AMAZING for the price! I liked it so much I got one for my dad and each of my brothers! Can’t wait to see what other quality products they release!  Pros: - Full-Grain Leather Construction - Good Quality Stitching - Compact - Available In Different Colors - Leather Smells And Feels Awesome! Cons: - US Bills need to be folded in half in order to fit - No RFID Protection (Due to the Full-Grain Construction)  Final Verdict: If you are looking for a premium minimalist leather wallet that will last a long time then this wallet is for you!  JUST BUY IT!",
