This is my second pair. They have a nice wide toe box so it doesn’t feel like you toes are being jammed together. The tread on these are a little softer than the ones I bought two years ago, which was a good improvement. I use them as general everyday shoes and for working out( not running). The color on these are more of a very light grey, not a beige which is what I thought they would be but overall a great product for the price!!",

I would not hike in them but for a basic zero drop shoe they will do until the sole wear out.

P Purcell,WHITIN Men's Barefoot Trail-Running Shoes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R166DLEIRRYGRL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4Z6F57R,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Size: 12 WideColor: W51 Black Gum,Verified Purchase,These are excellent driving shoes and seem to be holding up well.,
Mkstr,"Good barefoot shoes, but will vary greatly per person",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AAUXRQ7JO1W0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4Z6F57R,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Size: 13 WideColor: W51 All Black,Verified Purchase,"First off, a lot of the negative reviews are from people that have no idea what the term ""barefoot shoes"" means.  These shoes are meant to have very little, if any arch support or sole thickness.  You are SUPPOSED to feel some of the terrain beneath your feet.  So, if you are looking for cushioned, arch supported trail shoes, don't buy barefoot shoes.  Go instead for Topos, Altras, Hoka's or the like, which still offer a wider toe box, but will more padding.Second, many negative reviews site the fact that these shoes go by European sizing.  This shouldn't be a big deal, especially if you know the Euro size that corresponds well to your feet.  I ordered a size 13, and received a Euro size 47, which I know to be the perfect conversion for me.  But, sometimes shoe companies will indeed send a size 46, which is too small for my feet, but fall within the parameters of a typical US size 13.  In that case, I have to return the shoe and get a size up.  So, through trial and error, you just may need to understand the best Euro size for you and deal with it.For a barefoot shoe, I find that they have good side-to-side and heel support, and the tread is more than adequate.  How long the tread will hold up I don't know.  But it's grippy and a non-slip real rubber feel, that is fairly knobby (a good thing).My feet have high arches on the top of my feet, so I always need to loosen my laces so it doesn't cut off the blood and make my toes tingle.  In the case of these shoes, it was still too tight, and I had to remove the shoe inserts altogether.  They are still comfortable (for barefoot shoes) and I will keep using them this way.  They will possibly wear out sooner inside, but that is just a problem I have to deal with.  I would imagine most people won't have this issue and they will be fine.Overall, for the price, I'm perfectly content.  Time will tell if they hold up, and I will update this review accordingly.",
Basit Ejaz,Great Beginners Barefoot Shoe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMTJDHYHL1CAM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4Z6F57R,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Size: 10 WideColor: W51 All Black,Verified Purchase,"This was the first barefoot style shoe I ever bought and I loved them. I’m usually a 10.5 but surprisingly the 10w fit me just fine. I never took them running, let alone trail running, but just for wearing around town and going to the gym, they were great. They are super breathable as well so your feet don’t get hot, but the downside to that is they’re not very good winter shoes lol.  Your feet will feel it if the weather is cold, but otherwise they’re great. The construction is not exactly premium, especially the top around the laces, but it’s good. And the sole, at least for my pair was sturdy and held up well. Still a great shoe even with the downsides. Definitely recommend.",

I wore these pretty much exclusively for a week straight, and when I went to wear a regular pair of tennis shoes, I could feel that my arch had already adjusted to the flat sole. Definitely a good choice for people who wear only barefoot style shoes. Don’t plan on switching between these and regular shoes. They are comfortable for the most part, but you definitely feel the ground beneath your feet. I live in the city and walking on sidewalks you can sometimes feel the hard rubber grips poking into your heel when you land. These would be more comfortable for people who walk on more soft surfaces. Make sure the back of the shoe fits properly because my first pair didn’t and I got a blister from the rubbing on my Achilles tendon.",

The main reason for losing the fifth star is more related to problems with my feet instead of short comings of the product.  My feet supinate when I walk and while trying them on and walking around my living room, I was constantly walking on the outside of my feet from heel to toe.  These shoes are better for people without that problem.  If your feet pronate or over pronate, this shoe should be OK, although they don’t offer any arch support.  I also have a very high arch and high instep.  I need to buy wide widths in shoes for that reason.  These shoes were too tight for me across the instep. If you have normal feet this should not be a problem.  The soles on these shoes grip floor surfaces very well and should be good when walking on slippery surfaces. I tend to drag my feet when I walk (I’m on the north side of 70) and this was another problem for me.  In other comments, it is mentioned that they are a little on the long size.  If you wear a half size, it would probably be best to order a size smaller not bigger.  I wear a size 12 and probably could have gotten away with a size 11.But I still give them four stars for their price, looks and style.
