My only wish is that they came in more colors other than drab. The brown look good. I'm happy but all this grey and black nonsense. Not everyone is an incel.  Strongly recommend but of course your foot shape could vary.",

So far the wear and tear has been minimal. Comfort is out of this world. Fits great even with wide feet. First week or so I had an adjustment period to minimal shoe, after my feet hardened, it was much better.  Going to be buying more.

Ordered 13-wide since I normally wear 12-12.5 and thought that way I'd have plenty of room in them. Not so, they fell like about 11-11.5 and not as wide as I was led to believe. Also there is no flexibility in the opening so no way they can be called slip on for someone with a wide size 12-13 foot. Style is nice, they are lightweight. As others have said not much support, but for just around the house should be okay. I'm going to hope wearing them will stretch enough to make comfortable, but only time will tell.",

The shoes are noted as wide but they are actually extra-wide and the fabric buckles when you walk in them. They are cheap and not worth returning. I'll use them as throw away shows when I do painting someday or go to the beach. Improvements would be better sizing and an honest description of the soles which you cannot run in if you are seeking running shoes as I was.,
pacuff,Very easy slip on,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIFEJNR2BW22O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSSK3TGT,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 10, 2024",Size: 7.5 WideColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"This is a purchased item that I also paired with a set of Vine Item insoles.  The supplied insole was adequate although it did not have much arch support.  My feet felt like they were walking mostly on a hard surface without shoes.  The insoles provided not only additional arch support, but increased comfort level also.  According to the manufactures sizing charts, it said I should wear a size Eur 40 when other shoes I have purchased with European sizing were 42's. I think a 42 would have been more comfortable in ball of my foot area as I need a little wider than the 40's provided on one foot.  The additional insoles exacerbated the issue a little as I'm not having to wear them in a little in order to loosen the one shoe up.  Otherwise, the foot size was perfectly suited for a slip-on shoe as the shoe does not ride up on the heel.Overall, this is a comfortable shoe for when you need to slip it on and off several times a day without having to bend down.",2

Erik,Not quite minimalist shoes. Minimalist quality and comfort.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HEC035H8PHOH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSSK3TGT,"2.0 "," the United States "," April 26, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I'm a decently sized dude (6'1"" 235) with rather big flat feet (13.5 EEEE). I've had leg issues from my flat feet for years, and was always on a search for something that would help. A few years ago I tried the minimalist shoes things, and I've done great - I've been very happy with minimalist shoes, and it usually keeps me happy. I wanted a pair of slip-ons - so I purchased these - and I regret it tremendously. I've worn many types of minimalist shoes, so my complaints regarding comfort aren't related to them being minimalist shoes (just poorly designed).  Although they are supposed to be minimalist shoes, there is padding in the back and underneath the heal - leads to a lot of cushioning that I'm trying to avoid, and it affects fitment. The soles are also much too thick - so you don't feel the ground beneath your feet, and it requires more effort to flex the soles.  THE GOOD: Wide toe box - this is what saved these shoes from being rated 1 star. The toe box is quite wide, and that portion is quite comfortable. The design is as pictured - not amazing, but it's fine. You can slip on - the rigid piece of plastic means you don't have to bend over to pull them on.  THE BAD: They're not minimalist - there is way too much cushioning around the heal - this leads to a lot of play and movement around the heal when you're walking. The rigid piece of plastic is angled backwards, making it easier for the heal to slip out. The pieces are all glued together - looks like it'll fall apart without too much time. There is a flimsy piece of plastic holding the fabric up around the toes - after less than a mile walking it started to fold in - leads to a weird wavy appearance around the toes. They just feel like my feet around going to fall out.  Bottom line - I'll wear them a little bit - as soon as I have an excuse to replace them I will. Would never order again.",

I actually got these as a replacement for wearing Crocs out in public, and I was so happy I bought the second pair.  These shoes have worn nicely during my time with them (logo on the insole worn from all the miles I've actually worn them), with no manufacturing flaws in either pair. As stated previously, they look nice (in the colors I received). I love how you can step right into them and they stay on, with no flopping or falling off, while also being easy to step out of.

The toe box is as wide as I hoped. Zero drop heel-to-toe. If you're like me and these things are important to you these shoes deliver. I wanted them as inside shoes. You can slip them on without bending over. It has stiffer than normal construction behind the heel and it sort of opens backwards to allow an easier transition into the shoe. The materials seem really nice. I just got them so I can't speak to durability, but they look pretty classy, maybe even better than the pictures do them justice. The mesh of the entire shoe is quite breathable. Barefoot works, but I think the material might be a little rough for long term wear. So it's not really a slipper.

I usually want to have a little extra room in a shoe, but the flexible material makes up for this.  I will say that the rubber soles are a little soft. This is a good thing in one regard, as it allows the shoes to flex with your feet. But conversely if you're walking on chunky gravel you will feel every rock.

Also the toe-box is wide and fits my feet perfectly without crowding my toes. I also like that the back (heel portion) of the shoe is stiff and acts almost like a built in shoe horn for ease of slipping your foot in without bending down. I didn't think that was something that would add a lot of value to my life, but now that I'm used to them I really appreciate it. These shoes seem to have excellent, fit, traction, and are made out of nice looking material.

The Upper is made up of a slightly stretchy neoprene material and it feels very comfortable on the foot.  You have a reinforced heal which makes it easy to insert your foot and the insole is nice and thick.  I love the toe box it gives you foot room to breath and makes for a comfortable feel.  The sole itself is thin so the shoes have a foot on the ground feel and to me feel like driving shoes.  Overall nice pair of shoes that I use for quick wear and as a back up gym shoe.,2

No need to bed over to put them on. I can’t give these 5 stars because the padding on the insoles isn’t very thick. They’re comfortable, but they could be softer.

I would have asked to try next size up due to width across top of foot being constrictively narrow on me. The length is fine, plenty of toe room. But the constrictive width caused some difficulty to put shoe on by stepping into it. Now after wearing for a couple hours, the fit became more comfortable. So there may be a ""breaking in"" period. I was also able to step into the shoe as described at that point, but not at first. Quality of construction seems top notch as does the ample length and toe room.
