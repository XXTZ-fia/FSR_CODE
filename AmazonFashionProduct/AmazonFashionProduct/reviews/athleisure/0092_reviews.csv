They are definitely good for warmer weather, but not thick enough in cooler winter temps. The material is very silky/smooth, and I like that they offer roominess as compared to leggings. I sized up to make sure they were loose, and they fit well due to the drawstring at the waist. They have worn and washed well!",
Judy L. Ferguson,Great pants. Runs a little big.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EDI4K3EUCCKL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF2CZGJN,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 6, 2024",Color: A_black LeopardSize: X-Large,,"I am going through a leopard phase, I guess. This is my second pair of leopard joggers this year. I very much enjoy the print pattern. It's sort of a metallic on matte, and it's very cool! I used that size chart, but they run a little big, and fit more like wide leg pants than joggers, but it's not overwhelming. They are a nice weight for fall, and the material is quite nice quality. They are very comfy, and I love to wear them. In particular, the waistband is extra wide, and feels nice on. Plus, they stay up very well. Also: The cuffs at the ankles are unique, comfortable, wide, and don't dig into the skin, like a normal elastic cuff. I love that part.",
Jade,"Light, comfortable",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R319RDFIL1SK45/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF2CZGJN,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 20, 2024",Color: WhiteSize: Medium,,"These joggers are super lightweight, making them perfect for workouts or lounging in warmer weather. The fabric is thin though, which is great for breathability, but it does wrinkle easily, especially when you get them since they come vacuum-sealed. You might need to iron or steam them before wearing them to get rid of all the creases.  That said, they’re still very comfortable to wear. The high-waisted fit is a great fit, and the adjustable drawstring is great. The zipper pockets are also great, but they do feel like they're a little on the cheaper side, so they don't slide open as easily as expected.",
Amy Kelly,nice material and color,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NT1FGG93VVJ9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF2CZGJN,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2024",Color: Army GreenSize: Small,,"The material used to make these joggers is a nice weight. It feels substantial, not flimsy, while not being too heavy; and it drapes really nicely. Also, the drawstrings annd zippers are well-made, and I can tell they will hold up nicely. The green is a classic “army green” shade that goes with everything. And, they are truly high-waisted, as described. The material is nice enough that these are great for wearing out and about in casual situations, not just comfortable pants to wear at home. I think they run a bit large overall, and they’ll be too long if you’re petite. So, it’s worth taking your measurements and comparing them to the size chart before ordering. I definitely recommend these and think they would make a very nice gift if you have someone in your life who likes joggers. I’m including a few photos that hopefully will help everyone see some of the details I described.",2

W Christensen,Use the size chart!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYNM38Z5CRVM1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF2CZGJN,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 23, 2024",Color: Army GreenSize: Medium,,"EDITED REVIEW: I tried a size xsmall, and the pants fit really nicely. I am typically a small but always size up to a medium in athletic clothes (leggings, joggers, etc.), so I had ordered that size originally. The medium was way too big, but the xsmall fits perfectly. I would suggest looking at the size chart and not sizing up, even if you usually do that. These are quite high-waisted, so keep that in mind, as well. The fabric is very comfortable and feels nice against my skin. I like that there are zippered pockets.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: These pants run at least one size too big. They are also extremely high-waisted. I wonder if that is why they aren't flattering on me. Even if they were the right size, I don't think my body type is right for these. I like the olive green color, and the fabric feels really nice. I will see if these will work for my sister-in-law.",
LadyJean,So Glad I Sized Down.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F0VJUHN444W9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF2CZGJN,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 10, 2024",Color: A_black LeopardSize: X-Small,,"These joggers are baggy ah. They hug my hips/butt nicely though, but I am so happy I went down to an XS. I’m 5’7”, 115lbs, 27”Waist, 35”Hips, normally a small. They reach all the way down to my ankles and look cute bunched up or pulled down. Features zippered slant side pockets and a flattering seam in back. I got the black leopard and the fabric is pretty nice, lots of stretch, but not incredibly thick. So, a great choice for workouts, though they won’t keep you very warm in cold temps. Functional and stylish pants all around.",
Amazonian Babe,I fold the elastic waist ban,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAIGZWCZTZGC5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF2CZGJN,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 8, 2024",Color: A_black LeopardSize: Small,,I wasn't a fan of the waist ban.

They're well made, and maybe fashionable. I would've much preferred the material to be more of a sweatpants type than what it is, which seems just to be made to go out and party in. Not my thing at my age.",

It is good when working out as the fabric keeps u cool. It’s definitely not warm like most sweatpants. I wish I got a size down than what I got.,
Marie,Fantastic Color,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV54RIFAF87OQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF2CZGJN,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Color: RedSize: Medium,,"I love the color. They are very soft and a length is great. I also appreciate that they are high waisted. The reason they are a three instead of five star is because of the stomach area. They fit an odd where it too baggy. So while they’re comfortable, I’ll probably end up wearing them as pajamas as they are not very flattering.  Add originally had these at three stars because I don’t like the way they fit in the stomach area. They’re not flattering, but I had to add an extra star because they are extremely comfortable. They are true to size and I like the added detail of the zippered pockets.",
Janus,Size Down..?  Balloon Pants!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23EU0LNN78FIR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF2CZGJN,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2024",Color: WhiteSize: Medium,,"Hate to complain, but..  sizing is way off.  They're huge on me, with an excessive amount of fabric overall, giving the effect of balloon pants  I'm thinking these could be a win for the larger ladies, but do nothing for you if you're on the slimmer side.  Really, they look nothing like the photo in terms of fit etc.All that complaining out of the way...  the fabric and overall quality are a flawless five stars.",
squidney,Comfortable and well made,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HK6NAT3Z6DFL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF2CZGJN,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 19, 2024",Color: RedSize: Medium,,"I like the satiny, slippery, heavy yet thin, stretchy fabric.  Seams are all double stitched.  Wide elastic waistband with the cord to tie if desired.  I like the cuffs at the ankles which are the same material as the pants.  I am a 6-8 in pants ,5'7"", but my waist is not tiny.  I ordered M, but I would order down if you do possess a slender waist.  I love these pants and would not hesitate to wear them out in public.  One tiny flaw that might disappear after washing.......  The zippered pockets have to cross an additional seam in front, and it gets stuck going down halfway.  You can ease it past, but it might bother some people, not me",

I love the high waist fit and zip shut pockets. They actually look a lot like scrubs. As a doula, I will likely wear these to births, but also I like them as trendier colored pants to wear out walking, etc. The length is perfect for my 5'6"" frame. The only kind of weird thing is the tie at the waist is unusually long, but I just tied it in a good bow. The material is soft and definitely polyester, but feels breathable.",

The leopard print is tone-on-tone with a lightly more satin finish though it’s still quite subtle. These fit true to size and the waistband is wide enough that is doesn’t dig into your tummy or do something else that’s rather unflattering. They’re fairly flattering for joggers thanks in part to the fabric choice and overall construction. The finishing has been nicely done, giving these a feel of good quality overall.",
