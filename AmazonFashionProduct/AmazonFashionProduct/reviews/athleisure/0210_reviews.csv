Sarah K Peacock,Nice.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFMT9DNE8DEU5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B071DX6QV3,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 15, 2024",Color: BlackSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,Really pleased with this shirt! Doesn't flow out at the bottom like the picture. It is wide but just doesn't look like the picture shows it. It's more straight. But I still really love it anyways! Looks good still and feels so comfortable on. I recommend you try it! I'm glad I did and will more than likely buy more. Lol,
Selena Chronister,Impressed,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2J8LFYJ9BGL6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B071DX6QV3,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 27, 2024",Color: Royal BlueSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,I am short with curvy hips yet this top is very flattering and long enough to give good coverage.  The blue color is stunning and the fabric is soft. Appears to be a nice quality item and I will be buying more. I have a little fluff in the middle but if you are more apple shaped I'm not sure if it is roomy enough to fit without being clingy in the midsection,2
Musicbookfan,NOTE: Shirts are different than the ones purchased in 2018. New ones are not flowy or loose fitting.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1L2ZM4N2FF3QC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B071DX6QV3,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 27, 2018",Color: Royal BlueSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"UPDATED: I first ordered this shirt in blue back in April 2018. My absolute fav tank top, so I ordered three more in Jan 2019. If you read other reviews from 2018 it's clear how the shirts fit and how many people absolutely loved them. The current shirts are NOT the same shirts. The photos from the 2018 reviews are not the same shirts I received in January. However, nothing on the description indicated a change in the product material so I assumed I was getting the same top. I have reviews for both orders below:  JAN 2019 shirts: Pretty shirts, material is thin, typical workout/gym fabric. Despite the description the shirts I received were not flowy or loose fitting, but had a snug fit. These would make a nice workout shirt or shirt for layering. I usually wear either a S (in loose tops) or M ; I ordered these in a S (because a previous order of this shirt was a S and the fit was great) and while the length is good they are a too snug fitting and the armholes are tight. If I was going to reorder I would definitely size up to a Medium or even a Large. The red and green are very pretty, the colors are vivid. The pink is pretty, but thin and see-through, so it would be best used for layering. Unfortunately, because these are different than the top I received a few months ago I'll be returning. Please bring back the old tank that so many in 2018, including me, were raving about :(  APRIL 2018 Shirt: This is my FAV tank top I own. I purchased it 8 months ago and it still looks and fits great, I'm back to order more! I usually wear a small in looser tops, sometimes a Med - I ordered this in a small and it fits great. The blue color is pretty and it washes up very well - I wash on cold and hang it up to dry. The fit around the hem is loose, as pictured. It looks nice with leggings, just note with jean shorts the hem does land at the widest part of the hips and adds some width to that area - so depending on if someone wants, or doesn't want, or it doesn't even matter, it's something I wanted to mention. This top has a definite cotton feel to it, which some might not like in a gym top. That isn't too much of a negative, because it's a nice comfortable shirt, but since it's posted as a gym tank that is something to note. Overall this is my favorite, go-to tank and I highly recommend this top!",34
Mom326,Great for workouts/would buy again,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2E5SS363UC8EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B071DX6QV3,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 25, 2022",Color: GreenSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I purchased three of these.  I normally wear XL so bought one to try in olive greenish color.  The length is perfect to cover my muffintop & keep covered during weight training class, core, and HIIT.  I did find it to be a little loose in the chest area though I wear a D-cup sports bra.  For the 2nd purchase (teal), I went down to a size L & it was a little more snug in the chest area, yet maintained the right length for me.  I am more of a petite height, so the length would of course work differently for taller women.  Both dark-colored purchases are thick enough to hide a black sports bra.  The material is comfortably breathable & non-clingy.  I now have three of these (purple L the third time).",3

As is always the case, the colors are brighter on Amazon than they are in real life.  The green, which looks bright teal in the photos, is actually more of a dark teal/forest green.  But the material is light and airy, which is what I wanted for running.  The fit is the worst part.  Based on the reviews of some other ladies who had the shirt size and height/weight in the review, I got my normal t-shirt size.  One review specifically said she was 5'5"" and 190 lbs and got the L.  I am 5'6"" and 211 lbs so I got the XL and it's tight around the belly and bum because of my hips.  Granted, I'm pretty pear shaped and my upper torso is small, but the shirt clings to my hips something fierce.  I'm going to keep the shirts because I'll keep losing weight and I like the material.  I wish the colors were more accurately portrayed, though.",7

At 5'4"" and all torso, the small may work.  Debating on going back for the small.  It was a decent quality, but not over the top, but for $25, it was meh.  Update.  I returned for a small which worked perfectly.  I imagine if you are any larger in the chest (greater than 36C) it will run tight.  But glad I exchanged for the small.  Still a funky top.

They are so comfortable and fit me very well. I love them so much that I now own 5 of them and will be purchasing 2 more next month.  The one thing that I will say is that I carefully read the fabrication of the tops and because they contain rayon and could shrink, I wash them in a lingerie bag on delicate and hang them to dry and have not experienced any shrinkage at all.",

These really are very nice shirts, I LOVE the fit, they aren’t low cut, they are loose but not baggy, and they are a good length. They are really comfortable too, however, they aren’t breathable at all. I spend a lot of time outdoors and every time I’ve tried to ware these I end up having to change because they are just way too warm. I wish I could find these exact shirts in cotton.",
Amazon Customer,On the long side but a nice quality tank!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RM2FWG67NB1T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B071DX6QV3,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 5, 2020",Color: RedSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"Based on other reviews and the hope for a large flowy tank, I decided to go a size up (normally I am a 12/14 and wear a large but bought an XL). The tank is a nice color (I opted for the red) and quality. However the downfall is it is incredibly long. Not exactly the look I was going for but it will work to throw on and do yard work etc. Certainly if you are looking for coverage length wise this tank is for you!",2
