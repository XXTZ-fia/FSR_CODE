Fits perfectly. For reference I’m 5’5 and about 170lbs. High waisted wide leg. Zip hoodie is more as crop top but it looks nice with high waisted bottom. Makes waist looks snatched. Definitely will be buying in more colors. Also, will be ordering for friends too because they all like it so much. Comfortable and warm. Does not shrink in dryer.",

I had not expected this to fit or be so soft. I’m so glad I was wrong. I can tell this Weill continue to fit as I lose weight too. It makes me look like I have a waist! It is also warm without being too warm. I can’t believe I look so cute in joggers and a hoodie! I also love the hood. I am very photo sensitive and I wear the hood up to keep the sun off my face and use my hair to cover my upper neck. I also adore the thumb holes. I can tell this is not only going to be a morning walk staple, but also used for when ever I need good range of motion and to look good doing what ever the heck I want to to.  The price is so low for the quality. I’m a bit shocked that it is soft, breathable and durable. I have been using it daily for a week on workout and the inner thighs have not pilled. I even did yoga and 1 mile of waking a day. Yeah… I just placed an order for 2 more! I’m also tempted to buy the next size down for when I need it, but realized that’s what the working drawstring and stretchy waist is for. I will still buy more when I need to, but I don’t have to panic waiting for a few days as the new ones come in so I can be comfy and confident gain.. (I got off meds that made me gain 20 lb in 3 months. I’m already dropping the weight without trying.)  My ONLY negative is that the zipper is rough. If I’m not careful my thin nails break on it while zipping and it’s not smooth when you pull up the zipper. But I just take a little extra care when zipping up and it so far has not caught on my fine long hair or my delicate mesh workout tops. So I’m happy and it did not deter me from buying 2 more.",19

This is my second set and haven't worn the first one yet!! Ordered in white and after arrival, I was so excited I ordered the light gray. Depending on lighting, could appear lilac (purplish) which you can see in the ad photo. Now, when I say ""Game Changer "" , this company has set the bar!!!  Quality, zipper, color, fit,length and overall all style is 💯 and not generic looking. It does come in a vacuum sealed bag that's delivered in a Amazon package. So it was very wrinkled but that didn't bother me.(steaming can take care of that)!I'm planning to wear them both dressy casual with heels going out for dinner and casually pulled together running errands. This is a vendor that I’m sure to check out more of their clothing!!So based on Amazon recommendation Xl would best fit me. After reading description said ""relaxed fit "" and looking at size chart, I went with size lg and I'm happy that I did!! I'm 5'8 ,40DD, average built and carry  some weight in midsection. The fabric has ""give "" and should fit somewhat loose but not snugg. Can be worn now  and though early  summer. Also with proper undergarment the light colors aren't a issue for me.Hope this review is helpful for someone.",36
Amazon Customer,Defective,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QB8YC9P9BIXJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9Y5R63F,"1.0 "," the United States "," October 12, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Dark Brown,Verified Purchase,The outfit could be cute but I would give it NO STARS.  The review forced me to give it a star and it doesn’t need a star The issue with this is stitching. The finger holes for the jacket are way too small and tight and the location of the finger hole is too high that it makes it awkward to pull the jacket over the hand to use so these are pointless. The other obnoxious and harder to ignore defect is the front pockets are sewn for the back so you have front pockets that open on to your butt,

Otherwise I am very Happy - I'll have to RETURN the Black one & hopefully they will get me the Pants that are longer.

Well sewn stretch waistband with drawstring, seams down from waistband to bottom of pant in back and front. According to the size chart, size small pants are at least 40” long. Mine measured 38“. I really need a 41” pant to be able to wear with flats and have it fit me right. Took a chance on these though but didn’t work out for me, unfortunately. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Other than sleeves and pants being very short, the fit was pretty perfect in shoulders waist hips and butt. Fabric is just okay. Don’t love it...Fast fashion. 65%Polyester 30%Cotton 5%Elastane. Really wanted this one to work but another NO. Will return.

It really looks nice and it is mostly comfortable. The blue is very vibrant.  A couple of things that I am not really thrilled with are these: first, the zipper is difficult to operate. It tends to stick a bit. The second thing that I don't like are the wristbands and the placement of the thumb holes.  My arms are normal size, petite tops just don't work for me. The pants are good if you are 5'3"" or so, but the sleeves of this sweatshirt really seems like it is designed for petite women...shorter arms. While the sweatshirt has exceptionally long wristbands, the actual arm length (without the wristband) would be a 3/4 length sleeve. That either needs to be longer, or the wristband needs to be about an inch longer. Now...if you aren't using the thumbholes, it fits fine, ending just at the wrist, but that typically isn't long enough to stretch to your thumb. While trying to use the thumbholes, they really pull on your thumbs uncomfortably and you can feel it pulling on the sleeves. Don't even bother trying to reach for something, unless you want some pain on your thumbs.  Now I have a lot of thumbhole jackets, but I really haven't had this issue since manufacturers began making thumbhole sweatshirts. They normally make the thumbhole tops where the sleeves end about an inch or two on your hands, not at the wrist... Either eliminate the thumbholes, or make the sleeves longer...not the wristbands.
