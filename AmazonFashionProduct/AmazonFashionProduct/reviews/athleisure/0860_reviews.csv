The following November I purchased a pair in Pacific Teal and loved them just the same so last February I decided to get another black pair to put on the shelf for later as I wasn't sure if they would still be available in a few months or years.I recently have begun wearing all three pairs again and I can't believe the difference in the product.  As you can see from my pictures the new pants are bigger and also have already faded to a grey.  The legs are much longer and the part just before the cuff is much wider.  So instead of the nice tapered look I have in the other two pair, I have a very baggie leg.  I was thinking of ordering more because I love the first two so much but am not sure of what I will get.  Are they all different or did I just manage to get a strange pair?I wish I could say only good things but obviously the quality control is not what it should be for this product.",57
