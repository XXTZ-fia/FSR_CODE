The set is a bit pricy but considering you can wear the top and bottom together or separately, the price isn’t too bad. I wish the company sold the pants on their own because I would purchase them in multiple colors. I probably wouldn’t repurchase this set only due to the fact that it’s expensive for only the pants to fit and the top is rather large on me.",5
