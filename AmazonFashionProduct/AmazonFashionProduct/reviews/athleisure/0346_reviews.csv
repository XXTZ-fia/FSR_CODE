We bought a black one for my mother-in-law in April for her birthday and she loved it so much we bought a grey one for Mother's Day. She's always cold and these are now her favorite ""warm suits"". The photos of the grey one are true to color, the black of course is too, but grey can be funny, it can be lighter/ darker/ ""greyer""  than the photos, but this is spot on. The fit is as expected, MAYBE slightly small. My mother-in-law is mostly ""smalls and sometimes mediums"" but we wanted this a little bigger because of the fleece to be more comfortable but not baggy. The medium was perfect. It's not bulky (which was a worry with the fleece lining), the color is clean, the fit is great, smart enough to be worn out, and not just an at-home lounge suit. It also machine washes well. We are all Very Happy! We will order more.",16
