Nikki,Comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18R91QWE6E4F9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGT8PRD6,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 3, 2024",Color: 03-pinkSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,Love this hoodie. The pink color is really bright and the hoodie is nice and soft. It’s not a super heavy one. I could wear it on a fall day but I could also wear it under a winter coat and not be too hot. Thee are no strings for the hood which I prefer as my kitten likes to attack them like they’re her mortal enemy. Size seems to be accurate but I ordered a size up because I like my hoodies roomy.,
Great,comfy but cheap,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KMSNEQK4YBEL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGT8PRD6,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 28, 2024",Color: 02-coffeeSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"these hoodies are very comfortable but the material is cheap reminds me of shein quality. the sizing is also way off. I am usually a small in tops but ordered a medium for a oversized fit and it fits like a xxl , it reaches my knees and sleeves are extremely long .",
Oobi,Feels cheap,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZ7IBJ3ECTE11/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGT8PRD6,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 20, 2024",Color: 07-wineSize: Small,Verified Purchase,I got the smallest size and I know it’s supposed to be over sized but it felt like I was swimming in it. I’m about 5 feet tall. I do like the color I got though and the inside is very soft. It is truly oversized though. But also when I touch it it just feels cheap. It feels a little tacky to touch.,2
Lucy S Schiller,My favorite sweaters,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DGK15YPR6SQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGT8PRD6,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: 02-coffeeSize: Large,,"They're big, comfy, and cozy. Ever since I bought my first one, I was wearing it everyday. I've bought my second one just recently, and will probably be getting more. I love these sweaters! I bought a large (I'm 5'2"", weighing about 140). A medium would probably do, but I just love the big baggy fit.Only thing I'd consider a downside is these should be washed in cold water, and since it doesn't mention instructions for drying I'd hang-dry these in case of shrinkage.Have I mentioned how in love I am with these sweaters?",
GSDfanatic,It was huge,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDFK77Y6XV9AL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGT8PRD6,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 4, 2024",Color: 07-wineSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"The material was a more of a medium/heavy weight, which i wanted. The wine color was true to color.  I usually wear a size small, occasionally a medium.  I got the small and it was huge on me. I realize it's described as ""oversized "" but this was more like an Xl. I loved everything about it except the size.  Unfortunately it was returned.",2

Danielle clayton,"Beautiful, Quality Sweatshirt!!!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AKXST86S96KW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGT8PRD6,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 18, 2024",Color: 10-light GraySize: Medium,,"This is the perfect, over-sized sweatshirt! The quality is amazing and worth more than the price. Not too thick & not too thin. Plenty of room & plenty of comfort. It is wonderfully soft. I am 5'2"", 112 lbs., 34B, 27"" waist, 35"" hips. I bought the size medium. The sweatshirt is very roomy. The sleeves are a little longer than my arms which I love. The length hits my upper thigh area. I will continue to buy mediums for myself because I love the fit but a small could have sufficed. I would have had a little less room, but I still would have been very comfortable with the roominess of the small. I would not hesitate to purchase this as a gift for someone. The delivery was on time.",2
