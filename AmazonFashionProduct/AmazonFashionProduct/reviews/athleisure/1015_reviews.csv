They look great. I am 5’4” and had to fold the waist band over to make them fit properly. They have a cute tassel tie on the front, but folded they just look dumb. I don’t have a big behind. They would have been perfect if the waist band was 1-2 inches shorter. They would fit a taller woman perfect, or someone with a larger behind. They have a lot of room in the crotch. I’m sending them back - they’re not for a short/petite person. I ordered the medium.",8
