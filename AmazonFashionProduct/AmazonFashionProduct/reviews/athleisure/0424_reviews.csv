I searched for a long time for the perfect fit and length.  These are amazing.  Not too short , not too long. They flow beautifully and are loose in the arm pits to allow free movement.  They are lightweight and have a silky feel to them. For reference I am 5'4 and about 145lbs. I usually wear medium but bought large in case they shrink in wash. 3 pack of varying colors for 30 bucks- great find. Will buy more!",

They’re my favorite length and very flowy. I would say they run a little bit large, but I think that’s by design. The armpit hole is also a bit wider than some other brands. I, personally, don’t mind it. The only reason they lost one star for me is because of the material. It feels really nice, but even the tiniest drop of water or sweat leaves a visible stain. They show everything while working out. Once they’re washed and dried, the stain is gone again. They also tend to wrinkle really easily and you can’t use a little water or steam to get wrinkles out because… that leaves a water stain. It’s just an odd material choice. I’d still repurchase, it’s just something to know.",

Every spec of moisture, sweat, etc shows itself for-ev-er. It won't dry in a way where you can't see it. This is what it looks like just from water and sweat after an afternoon of doing my every day life. And while I'm probably more messy than most while working in the garden, I'd expect my sweat to dry down so you can't see it 6 hours later.",2

If you're looking for a long tank, this is not it. I prefer long tanks, but plan to keep these simply because of the comfort and price point.  As others mentioned, when you sweat and it starts to dry, the fabric has a stained look to it. Doesn't bother me because I only wear them for working out or working around the house.

Cons: The smallest size is too big! It’s not egregiously huge, but on me the deep arm holes combined with the extra fabric look strange (5’1” ~108 lbs). I intended them for HIIT classes, paired with leggings and a long line sports bra. I think the dimensions are simply too exaggerated for my size and would be distracted by extra fabric swishing around during a workout. Hopefully Ododos released an XS!",3
