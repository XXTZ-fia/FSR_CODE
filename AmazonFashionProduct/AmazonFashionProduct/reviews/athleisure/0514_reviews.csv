Being a woman who loves animal prints I loved the black and gray leopard print on this bra. The straps are not uncomfortable and do not press into my shoulders making me uncomfortable, rather they just sit there comfortably. The bra itself, fits perfectly and curves where it needs to curve and is made of a thicker material—like a swimsuit-type material.  It is padded but not overly padded.  I am planning to purchase more of these sports bras in the future!!!!  This was an excellent price for a stylish and comfortable necessity piece.",

Normally these are something I prefer to try on in person and not just order with the thought of ""I'll return them if they don't work out!"". So glad that not only did I trust other reviews, but that they worked perfectly for me. I was reluctant on the support with a ""Y"" back, however it held the girls in place made me feel unrestricted in my movements and was very comfortable.  I normally wear a 36B bra so based on the chart and other reviews I decided to give the XL a try and it fit perfectly. Tight enough to give me the support, yet not too tight that I could not move comfortably in it. Especially looked nice in my racer back tank and the straps were hidden instead of the usual look I sport where you can see the sports bra straps under my tank. Definitely will be ordering more colors to replace what I have.",22

Elizabeth M.,"Fits right, adorable design, but straps dig & pads fold and shift",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GOM6BKQD58IS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4TBD5HF,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: YellowSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I like the color of this sports bra and the design is adorable. The fit is spot on and the support is light as expected. The only issues I have is the stupid padding shifts, folds, and is annoying when washed. The pads are also weirdly shaped like a shoulder pad from the 80s. The only reason I haven’t just pulled them out is because they seem to be nipple shields, but at this point I might just take my chances. The straps are thin and dig into my shoulders, but it’s kind of expected since I see it as more of a yoga bra than something that requires support. I wash it in the dryer and air dry it. I cycle through lots of sports bras because I work out daily and the running girl bras hold up well. They are my favorite brand right now. I have been replacing my old Victoria Secret sports bras with these as they get worn out.",

I wear it all the time though just because it is comfortable and supportive, just not for running. It's interesting the name of the brand is running girl because this sports bra is not high impact. Also, I wish the straps were thicker and more supportive, but they are just two strings and can hurt your shoulders/neck/back sometimes because the weight is not distributed thoroughly.",4
