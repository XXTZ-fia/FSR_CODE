Roxy Rich,Perfect for Petite!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VEE92YUHNZGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYHC2WRZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 13, 2024",Size: X-SmallColor: Light Grey,Verified Purchase,"So difficult to find clothes at 5’0. This fit great!  Just pull pants top up if you want to cover whole stomach. Length is good for a low or high heel. Comfortable, fabric breathes. So pleased I bought four in different colors. I’m hoping they make one with long sleeves , crew neck for fall. I almost didn’t want to leave a review because I may get more and don’t want them to run out of XS. I am 54 and weigh 114-119 depending on the day. Fabric is not see through, thank Goodness!  Could dress up or down. Super pleased with colors! Well made. Not flimsy. Does not look cheap like other brands. 5 stars all the way.",14
Hailey Ruston,BUY THIS SET,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KRUUNZZN6VTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYHC2WRZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 10, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Light Grey,Verified Purchase,My absolute most favorite material.

zd123,Quality good,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P03GLKFR5A83/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYHC2WRZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 4, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Light Grey,Verified Purchase,"the color is a perfect grey and the material is super comfortable and stretchy. The only reason I took a star off is because the shirt, (which i wear separately all the time) fits great up top but then flairs a little towards my stomach / waist. It is not form fitting towards the bottom which I personally just don’t like the flared look for a top and the pants are a little short. I am 5’6 but am taller in my torso and not so much in my legs and it still kinda rises at an awkward length. I wear the bottoms around the house so it does not matter anyways. It is very comfy and worth the price!",

They're warm but not hot, so great for most weather. I usually order up in size, because I mean more toward frumpy than tight. With these, I don't recommend that. You can easily go your normal US size, if not a size down. They weren't baggy, because they're stretchy, but let's just say they weren't very flattering accenting my regular shape. Which usually wearing clothes will do a little lifting or shaping and I'm sure smaller ones would've, they're just my laze around casuals. The material is really soft. They're easy to clean by laundering the same as most regular clothes. Good quality",
