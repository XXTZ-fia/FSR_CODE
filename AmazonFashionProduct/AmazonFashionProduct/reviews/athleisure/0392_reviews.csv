I got the creamy white color and it’s a great winter white. It’s very well made and much of the special seams and details are very close to lulu. I also think this is the same, or as close as possible, fabric that the scuba line is made of.  Only minor complaint is that these sleeves are longer than expected.  I like an oversized look so I ordered the large. Next one will be a medium for sure.  Washes well. Don’t skip on this one!",

I wear this jacket to work, workouts, and just running errands. It is soft and so comfortable! It does not shrink when you wash it. The thumb holes fit great! One thing that is so great about this sweatshirt is the mesh pocket inside the center pocket. It is great for holding my AirPods securely. I have recommended this sweatshirt to all my friends.",4

Not a fan of the color selection either. I originally ordered “ink blue” which appeared to be a nice gemstone blue/teal tone in the photo. What I got was navy blue, boring. I have ordered from this company previously, and I’ve been fooled by the advertised colors before versus what you actually get, annoying to say the least. I then ordered sage green, it was just okay looking. Also beware this is very much over sized. I sized down to an XS and it fit right. My regular size small would’ve been huge.
