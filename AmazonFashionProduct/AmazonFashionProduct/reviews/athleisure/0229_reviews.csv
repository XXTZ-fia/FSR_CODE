At 5'4"" and all torso, the small may work.  Debating on going back for the small.  It was a decent quality, but not over the top, but for $25, it was meh.  Update.  I returned for a small which worked perfectly.  I imagine if you are any larger in the chest (greater than 36C) it will run tight.  But glad I exchanged for the small.  Still a funky top.
