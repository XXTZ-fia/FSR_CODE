I have a 36b bra size and didn’t want it tight in the chest and saw that the model is wearing a size small and has a bust of 31.5 inches. I am glad I got the size medium as it fits me nicely, like the model. I think a size small would be too snug in the chest and elsewhere. The color blue is not an electric vibrant blue as shown in the photos, but still a nice blue,  just a little muted. The twist takes a little getting used to, I don’t have other clothes with twists. This twist is a bit bulky but not bad. The v neck is a nice detail without being too deep a v. I like the length of this in back. It is made of thin lightweight, soft stretchy fabric. This top is good with high waisted yoga pants or other high waisted bottoms.",2

It feels a bit awkward at my waist, but I think I can make it work with high-waisted pants. This is not a shirt I would use for working out or being athletic. The high twist at the waist and cut of this shirt makes it uncomfortable to move around in and shows my belly if I even slightly raise my arms. Plus, the fabric is a soft, cotton-feel, not like your typical athletic fabric. So, it makes a good casual shirt.",
