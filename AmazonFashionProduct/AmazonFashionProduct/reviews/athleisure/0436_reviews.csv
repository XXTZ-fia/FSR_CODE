I also have a temporary ileostomy, and have had a hard time finding pants that fit under my stoma without feeling really uncomfortable. These pants come up over my butt in the back, but i can easily wear them about 2+ inches under my navel in front, which means they don’t put pressure on my stoma!",8

The drop in the crotch is perfect, has a medium rise but still has full coverage. Length is great, I have normal/ longer legs and the length is perfect. Fits in the leg just how a jogger should fit. These fit like a $100+ jogger pant would.  The fabric is fantastic as well, breathable with a nice amount of stretch, warm but cool as well. I have washed them 15+ times and they still look brand new. I just purchased two more colors in these pants, I will now have four colors. These are the kind of joggers that could be worn as casual professional pants as long as they are a solid color. My favorite print is the green camo but I think that print is out of stock a lot. Just a comment on size. They do run very small. I usually wear and xl but get a 3 xl in these pants. So just size up and don’t be afraid to go up 2 sizes.  Just buy a pair, you will get so much use out of them. I’m sure you’ll come back for more.",
