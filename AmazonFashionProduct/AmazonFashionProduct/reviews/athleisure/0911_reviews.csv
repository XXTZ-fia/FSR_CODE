I'm petite (5', 105lbs - ordered a small) and these are definitely oversized on me; they very much look like lounge/PJs which works for me, but something to keep in mind if you were hoping to wear this as true joggers.  Last two call outs, but not enough to deduct stars: - There is no drawstring, but the waistband stretches - The waistband is very wide and on someone with a short torso is slightly uncomfortable, but I fold it over and wear them around my hips with no issues",5
