I may be wearing this as a thin layer under a sweatshirt.",5

I returned that shirt and asked for a replacement - only to have the same problem with the second shirt. While the difference was not as striking, the back panel was definitely shorter than the front even when laid out on a flat surface. So, it too was returned.
