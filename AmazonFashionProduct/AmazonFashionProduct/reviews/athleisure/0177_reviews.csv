These leggings are super soft, the softest ones I’ve actually ever bought! The pockets are great, although a little higher than I’m used to, so it can be hard to access when I’m sitting down. It has a band at the top of the waist, which I’m not a huge fan of, but it’s not super tight and doesn’t really cut into my waist. The leggings do stay up really well so there’s no slippage and having to pull them up throughout the day. They’re not super thick but they are not see through. It’s great for the Phoenix weather but would need extra layers in colder places. The quality seems really good, but I’ve only had them for a few weeks. There is a tag that comes in them that is very itchy - I pulled this out of all of them! Overall, if these stay opaque and the quality holds up throughout the year, I would definitely buy more colors (I got all black!).",36

I love them for the thick fabric and the lack of shine on them, plus the pockets and just the seams on the legs. I like the placement of the seams as well as the fact that they never bothered me when wearing them. They are still so good to me now that I am 28! No other leggings make me feel so good to wear them. But I've finally started to rough up the seams while bouldering.  But these are the closest I have ever gotten to the feel of the old VS leggings. I do think these are pretty thick, not shiny, the seams are just like the VS leggings and I think it looks really flattering for me. I maybe wish the pockets were a little bigger and just even a bit higher in the waist. But I've bought so SO many different brands and I like these the most so far. The price is wild because I was considering buying the super soft Sweaty Betty leggings that are so much more expensive. Haven't actually tried the Sweaty Betty leggings but felt the super soft leggings fabric at Nordstrom Rack and it was surprisingly thick and felt really similar to my VS leggings.

These not only fit comfortably around my waist (a little loose), but they go down to my ankles.  They're not as thick as some other brands, but they are not see-through either.  The colors on the site match perfectly to the product that arrived.  I had no flaw that I could see in the 3 sets of 5 that I bought.I noted the other reviews about pilling and washing.  So, I wash these alone in the washer with like colors (no towels or other cottony materials to shed to the leggings, and then I hang them to air dry.  So far, I've only done one washing but the pairs I have washed came through perfectly intact.Also, the crotch gusseting seems durable.I think overall, these are a great buy for me to add to my collection.

Between being busy with prepping for the move & traveling around to find the right city for us to settle down, I ended up gaining about 30 lbs. The few clothes I have left that I can actually get into don't flatter all this extra fluff, so I decided it was time to give in & buy some bigger clothes so I can at least feel decent about myself. I didn't want to spend a lot of money, just needed some basics to get by until I get back to my normal size. Since it's hot AF in Mexico, I needed to be sure I purchased clothing with lightweight, breathable fabrics. I did that before we left the US, but unfortunately those clothes don't fit me anymore. Because we've been traveling a lot, I also wanted fabrics that don't wrinkle easily. Was a little nervous about the fabric content, since most of the poly spandex blend clothing I have is very hot & not breathable at all, even if it's thin fabric. However, based on the reviews and the higher content of spandex, I went ahead and ordered. I'm glad I did, because they are not hot despite it being really hot in Mexico lately (80-96° F). They are pretty flattering, which is not easy to do on me right now, and the pockets are functional. Normally I don't use pockets because I workout at home, but I've actually worn these leggings on a few city tours, and used the pockets for my Pixel 7 pro since it was easier than pulling it out of my purse every time I wanted to take a photo. These have become a staple for me right now! I've paired them with crop tanks for working out, tunic tops, tees, and tanks with a short sleeve cardigan for errands. The colors are true to the ad, they're flattering, wash well, and don't wrinkle easily. Took off one star for two minor issues: the fabric attracts dog hair pretty easily (& wipes off with medium difficulty), & the way the key pocket is sewn in leaves a weird line in that area. Most leggings with key pockets have elastic sewn all the way around with an extra flap sewn in. These leggings don't have elastic on the key pocket area, it stops there, so the pocket of fabric leaves a small line there. If you're wearing a longer top it won't matter, but since I'm wearing with crop tops mostly, it's really noticable to me. I might've been able to wear a medium, as the larges do slide down a bit, and bunch a little around my hip flexors when I sit down. However, since I'm very self conscious about my body right now, the last thing I needed was more tight clothing. I liked these so much I bought two packs - the burgundy, grey & black, and the set of 6 black, grey, green, blue and pink. I was originally planning on only using these while I'm heavy, but I like them so much I'll probably order more once I get back to my normal weight. For reference, I'm 5'7"", currently 180 lbs, 44.5 bust, 37 waist, 43 hips.",53

Amazon Customer,Cellulite.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BO925OXWJBT7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09X1VJFF2,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 1, 2024",Size: MediumColor: 5 Packs - Black/Gray/Pink/Blue/Green,Verified Purchase,"I actually like the feel and fit and thickness of these leggings. The one well two problems I have is that you can see every dimple in my thigh, my kneekle, my knobby knees and every shin splint I have. You wouldn’t normally (with bare legs) be able to see these; but here they are large and in charge. I haven’t noticed if this is true with other leggings but it is with these. I will keep cuz I’m only wearing them to barre and there’s only women in the class. Second, I did get them because they included a pink, green and blue pair together. The colors are decent enough but the pink is really more of a purple and and I had ordered the suggested sports bras cuz they seemed to match pretty close but the only ones that actually matched were the black, grey and blue. Was really looking forward to that pink and so I’m naturally disappointed, especially because they don’t match… so it you like having an ‘outfit’ or ‘look’ don’t count on getting pink.  It really sucks that none of these brands carry complete outfits with comfy tops And bottoms. They sell tops… or bottom and somehow the model is always matching. But finding a grouping yourself to match each other impossible.",2

These are by far the most comfortable leggings I have ever worn. - I have degenerative disc disease in my lumbar area and find most pants put too much pressure on my lumbar. Because these are high waisted it minimizes the pressure on my lumbar. Thick enough to wear in the winter. They seem to be well made. Long enough for taller people.,7
