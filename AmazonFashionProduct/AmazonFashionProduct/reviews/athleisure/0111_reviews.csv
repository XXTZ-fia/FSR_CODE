Philly mama,Love!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HGAR0EA9HU47/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYXJKC3N,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 12, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Dp Lime,Verified Purchase,"I was looking for some lightweight hiking pants and these really do the trick. They fit great. At first I sized up because I didn't want them to be tight, but I need to return those. They are very true to size (if not on the bigger end), and a larger size ended up being really huge. Anyhow, I love them so much that I got 2 pairs for all of my camping and hiking needs.",2
Rivergrover,So glad I discovered these pants!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X220OBPOEQ4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYXJKC3N,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 2, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Gargoyle,,"I own 4 black pairs of these & now am buying 2 grey pair in XL.  My waist is 40 inches & they fit me perfect.  I wear pull on pants because of my big waist.  So I originally bought the first 2 pair because I needed to cut tall weeds in the heat.  I never got to the weeds & the Chicago weather is now cold but I love these pants.  Now the black ones just look like plain black pants.  Not sure how the grey ones will look as there are reviewers who complained about the different fabric cutting the legs off visually.  I do not think that will bother me but we will see.  The mesh panels which are quite opaque let some breeze in while the solid portion protects your legs from bugs.  The main fabric is waterproof but not like plastic or even quite like a typical wind breaker.  It does not look shiny but matte.  If you get either side of the main fabric wet it dries right up & can even be wiped dry with a cloth.  Dust marks can be wiped off too.  I love the elastic jogger bottoms to keep out bugs & fit closer on the leg.  The waist is elastic with an elastic drawcord but I do not use it & just pull them up.  I wear an XL in most elastic waist pants & I would say these are women 16-18.  They fit me loose except in the waist.  Also the fabric is very stretchy on the bias (diagonally) so they are very comfortable, even to sleep in.  I am wearing a pair today & it is 25 out & I was comfortable walking from car into library.  So they re wearable in the cold to an extent. I wish they had more colors available.  I do not get a swishing sound when I walk so I think the reviewer who complained about that just has legs that rub each other.",
giana,"Feels great, looks nice but",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFJS2JREJ9KK3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYXJKC3N,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 16, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Dp Lime,Verified Purchase,Too baggy in the waist area even after the string is pulled.  The waist seem to be one/two sizes up in comparison to the waist.,
Chelsea,Great outdoor pants!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20KM0K1FGFX0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYXJKC3N,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 18, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"These pants are PERFECT for outdoor activities, especially cool mountain nights. The material is kind of like a thicker windbreaker material, keeping you warm but also protecting the legs from mosquito bites. I am between sizes and decided to size up to be cautious, I should have gone with the smaller size as the draw string doesn't do much for helping with the too loose waist, because of that I had to dock one star. But if you purchase true to your size, these will be great pants for you! Highly recommend!",
Dnonymous,Green hiking pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15EABVSOADCJB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYXJKC3N,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 24, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Dp Lime,,"I like these hiking pants. They are roomy and nylon material. They are a muted matte green color, but are not super soft and do make the rustle sound when you walk quickly, but they fit and look nice. Good for outdoor activities. Great pockets too.",
JPizz617,Awesome Hiking Pants!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R183IK0IYPACZV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYXJKC3N,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 31, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Gargoyle,,"Extremely cute and flattering outdoor hiking pants.  I think these are meant to be somewhat cropped or ankle length - I am 5'3 and they fit me perfectly.  However, if you're taller, I think they'll also look very cute at the ankle length or cropped, as well as paired with hiking colorful hiking socks.  These will be the perfect outdoor pants for me, for anything from hiking to walking my dog on the trails.  These pants are light but provide protection from mosquitos, ticks, and other bugs depending on the trail and season.  I found them true to size and ordered the size I normally wear.  I was very impressed they fit so well and looked great, since I am a bit on the petite side and finding flattering pants can be hit or miss.  Highly recommend for a nice pair of hiking pants!",
Kim,Really comfortable pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UJQ0Z8DFLPH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYXJKC3N,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 17, 2023",Size: X-SmallColor: Black,,"These Bass Outdoor rogue pants are great. They're lightweight, very breathable and super comfortable. They have nice sized pockets and zippered closures. The waistband has an elastic drawstring. I sized down to an XS and they fit great everywhere but the length. I'm 5'11"" so I'm used to pants being short on me but these pants are shorter than most. The pants are made out of that fabric that makes a noise when you walk. Very nice quality active pants.",
cloudpunch,Well made,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KR4YSICN0AZP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYXJKC3N,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 4, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,,Not in love with these pants.  They are well made and I will definitely wear them.  They have a netting bit across the knees that I wasn’t aware of.  The drawstring is not super efficient.,
Marsha Rhea,Breathable Inset Panels Makes Pants More Functional than Fashionable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TXOSC9FFN9YO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYXJKC3N,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 4, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Dp Lime,,The breathable inset panels might be a welcome feature on a hot hike but they add fullness and break the pant leg line. The pants have a generous cut in legs and waist so maybe order the smaller size for a better fit. The bungee cord in the waistband seems more decorative than functional. These are comfortable pants and well made so they will get a lot of wear.,
Christine,Bass Outdoor Women's Roque Pant,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MCG605Q58HX9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYXJKC3N,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 4, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Gargoyle,,"LOVE these pants. I am not a person who likes wearing shorts but it is very difficult to find pants that you can wear in 90 degree heat without heat stroke. These are perfect for that. The large mesh panels make these very cool to wear, and the mesh isn't see through at all! they wash great and are extremely comfortable to wear. If you're tall, they're probably going to be capris. I am 5'9"" 200lbs wearing XL and they hit mid calf. that's fine for me, but might be relevant if you're getting them in hopes of avoiding ticks and other nasties.",
JB,great summer pants!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K16D8WBLHNWS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYXJKC3N,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 29, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Gargoyle,,These pants are lightweight and breathable. They fit perfectly when ordering according to letter size. They would be perfect for hiking considering their breathability and they do not chafe even after all day wear when it is extremely hot out. I would recommend them to anyone who likes to spend time in the heat but likes the coverage of pants.,
