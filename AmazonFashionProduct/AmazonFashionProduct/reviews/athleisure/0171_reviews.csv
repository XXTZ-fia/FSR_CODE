Cori,"Soft Material, Fits True To Size",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1L36HA3P53M6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09M8B7RTN,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 9, 2023",Size: LargeColor: 2 Pack Black/Green,Verified Purchase,"I've been looking for tank tops to workout in for awhile because I keep wearing oversized tees to the gym and seeing all the other women there in cute, fitted tank tops and then I just feel out of style. I don't need to be stylish to workout, but I admit feeling cute makes me feel good and these tank tops make me feel cute! I wear high-waisted leggings most of the time that go to or just above my belly button. The tank top either hits right at my belly button or just above it so they go super well with the leggings. The material is a soft nylon that works great for high intensity workouts as well as low intensity walks. Not sticky when sweaty. It seems like it's double-lined too so it's not a flimsy shirt at all and it flatters because it's not a thin material that shows every curve and fold. I'm a large chested woman and high top tanks can sometimes look goofy on me - these look so good. I got the green/black combo pack. Will be buying it in more colors. I AM 5'7"" AND WEIGH 148 LBS with DD size bra",9

In fact Aram recommend them so highly that I almost didn’t write this review because Im obsessed and don’t want them to sell out lol. I hope they get more colors.

The white top is ever so slightly see through, you might need to wear pasties underneath. I tried it on with silicone pasties but then the outline of the pasties was visible, so keep that in mind. Might have to rock the nips with this one. They are slightly snug to be 100% true to size imo. I am 5’4 115lbs with B cups and the small fit, but if I had bigger boobs it would be too tight.",

Easy to fix though for me, I just need to readjust occasionally. I wear these shirts as pajama shirts, going out shirts, or gym shirts. I love them and the way that they look.  P.S.

It's cropped to the navel ( for taller people it might rest just above) but it's a perfect length for my high rise leggings. The fabric is super soft,feels great, and silky enough it seems it won't absorb stains too easily. Not certain on that one yet though. I chose a size that would just sit on my skin, not act as compressive at all. I wear a UK30FF and am 137lbs, and I think the Medium is perfect for me.  I'll update later on how quickly it dries after a workout and if it stains easily.",7

I decided to return and try an XL…they fit a little better but still had the same awkward gap. I’m really bummed thought because there is so much food about these tanks! I love the double lining and the material feels very quality. There is stretch but I wouldn’t deceive the material as stretchy but because of that no bra is totally an option with these. They are a good length and the neckline is as described. Overall, these had major potential but did not work for me. I’m not sure if it’s the size of my chest of if it’s the design. I uploaded the photos and it’s one of each size",14

So they were NOT new and honestly disgusting. They smelled, wrinkled and again covered in someone’s deodorant. Disgusting!",
Issa,Love this top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GLL56P47EFP4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09M8B7RTN,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 25, 2022",,Verified Purchase,Love this top! It did however fit smaller than I thought it would and I don’t like my tops to fit too tight so I went with a large. I’m 117lbs and 34C cup for reference.,17
