Carol,Very nice top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1J0IH9HOA6C0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWJMJDBV,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Peacock Blue,Verified Purchase,"Good purchase for me, I ordered another color while they are still available. After reading the reviews I followed their advice and ordered up two sizes from normal 2xl for my 43"" bust. If they listed 3x it would have a loose fit. As it came it was good but not much extra room. The material is a little felt like and a slightly stiff but not annoying for me. It's cool weather it is a nice warm layer. It is a little thicker than I expected, not thick, but not a T shirt material either. The Peacock color is like the photo and exactly what I wanted. The sizing issue is my only complaint and the reviews prevented it from being a issue. A physical measurement from arm pit to arm pit and shoulder to hem might have made the choice easier to decide. International sizing and S-M-L etc are so inconsistent it must be the cause of most of the online shopping returns. Edit: The second one was as nice as the first. Both survived a gentle wash and air dry. I didn't want it to shrink and it's good. The fabric was slightly stiff and became softer after the gentle cold water wash. The Khaki color is like the photo and is softer after the wash, I've decided to treat them gently because I would like to keep them nice and not ware them out too soon. I also bought the full zip jacket and it was just a nice. I appreciate the zipper pockets in the jacket. The jacket is available in more sizes and it is consistent with the pullover size.",2

The shirt is well made and the zipper is of good quality.  It is a bit pricier than I’d usually pay for this type of shirt from an off brand.  It’s a good buy but make sure you know the sizing.,2
