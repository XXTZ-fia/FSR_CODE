I have never liked how bulky Winter clothes make me feel . I guess you could say it’s almost like a sensory issue . But the material is tightly woven , warm , light on your body . Great roomy seat . Vibrant almost glossy navy color . BIG pockets , quality elastic encased waist band . OK … long story short if your even thinking about ordering this ; DO IT !!!!

However, I’m giving it a 4-star rating because, while it’s cozy, it still looks a bit too much like a traditional lounge set. It would be harder to dress up or style for other occasions.  The fabric is a nice weight—definitely not cheap—and it’s super stretchy and comfortable. I appreciate the great length, especially since I’ve had issues with sleeve and inseam lengths in other sets. For reference, I’m 5'9"", 215lbs, and a 38 DDDD/G. My inseam for flats is 33/34 inches and 36 inches with heels. These fit perfectly, and the cuffed design works well.  This set washes nicely with no noticeable shrinkage, and I bought an XXL. Overall, it’s a solid purchase for lounging, but not as versatile for dressing up.",2

Somewhat boxy and loose. The pants are long, which most are, but the cuff always helps in pants that are to long. The problem with the pants... the legs and hip areas are massive. For those of us with no butt, hips or tummy these appear  to be very baggy. Also, the material is much thinner than expected.  Many comments said these were warm. Maybe if you live in California or Florida. We have not worn them yet, so perhaps warmer than they feel. Beautiful color choices and the material is soft.",3

The top was roomy and the pants were very very fitted like tight joggers on me, , which I don't care for as I carry weight in my rear end and thighs.  I prefer my lounge wear the opposite, looser bottoms.  If I went up to large, the top would be huge.  So if you're about my size, but have slimmer legs, less butt and more chest a medium would probably fit you great.",

I found that the large was the correct fit and it is an amazing outfit. I love them all so I went to order six more in different colors (and return the medium). The price has increased from $27 to $41 ! Why wouldn’t they want to retain their customer base by allowing you to re-order or return for the same price as it was just two days ago when I made the original purchase.  I called Amazon and they weren’t willing to do anything and just said that the prices can change. I’m just shocked that I went to return the medium and there’s no option to get a replacement in a different size. You have to return it for a $27 credit and then re-purchase the correct size for $14 more, 41.00. In addition, the extra cost for 6 more sets would be 70 more dollars than 6 sets would have been two days ago.  It’s absolute price gouging!! They had me as a lifelong customer when I saw how great these outfits were. I’ll never buy from them again. It’s a shame because they have beautiful clothing, but I’m not supporting a business that price gauges their customers.  I leave for vacation in two days so I’m not able to wait for a reply from them regarding some type of customer satisfaction offer so it is what it is. Make sure you order what you want at the price you want because once they know they have you as a customer, they will double their pricing.  Amazons lack of empathy considering I spend thousands upon thousands of dollars with them every year is also frustrating. They surely could have offered me a credit or price adjustment to keep me happy, especially at Christmas. So disappointed, I was looking forward to having 10-15 new sets of loungewear.",3

I have to roll up the waist so the crotch isn’t hanging down and then I lose the pockets (and the length is still long with the waist rolled). I bought the size Amazon recommended, but both the top and bottoms are loose. It’s fine around the house I guess. The cuff at the bottom of the pants isn’t like the photos. The cuff is more than half as long as they are on the model. The top fits well. The fabric is soft.  I know I’m short and that’s not why I gave 1 star. The one star is for the cuff and how the waist isn’t quite like pictured. I just wanted fellow short girls to know that these pants are looong! Great for the talls.",4

The top had no band on the bottom so to look decent it had to be tucked in, and I didn’t really like that. Was not expecting the fabric to be so thin; it’s more pajama weight than sweatsuit weight. The ankle elastic doesn’t fit just right and the pants legs kept creeping up my legs. If this “sweatsuit” doesn’t wash and dry nicely, I’ll be sending it back. A little disappointed as the overall quality could be better. There’s probably a better option out there, but I needed it right away and it arrived next day.
