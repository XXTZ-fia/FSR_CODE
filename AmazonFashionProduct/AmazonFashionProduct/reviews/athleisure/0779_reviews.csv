Deborah H. From Oklahoma,Love love love this outfit!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21ON8NDU7E9WL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWNZ12W3,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: PinkSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"My friend had this outfit on when we meet at the airport for a 2 week long trip.  I loved how nice the fabric felt and how classy it looked on her. She told me how comfortable it was and easy to travel in. (She owns the black one.) I wanted to order one as soon as I got home to try even though I am quite a bit taller than she is, i just couldn’t get over how sleek and  classy it looked!  So when I got home, I ordered mine in this pretty pink.  Love the color!!!!When it came in, I was so excited to try it on and boy was she right about how comfortable It is to wear.  I love the fact that it doesn’t wrinkle easily either and It fit me perfectly!She wore hers more than once on that trip we were on. The outfit looked just as nice the second time she wore it as it did the first time that she wore it. It fits to size and is a fantastic value for the price.  I HIGHLY recommend this outfit to everyone.  It is an outfit that looks great on all sizes and shapes. You can dress it up or down depending on the occasion.  One of the best purchase I have made this past year!  I plan on buying at least one or two different colors.",6

The material is thin but not see through (I bought the light beige color), its coloring is true to the pictures, and it fits true to size. It does show every line (including the pockets underneath), so be mindful of what you wear as undergarments. It’s incredibly comfortable and feels like pajamas but definitely looks cute enough to wear out and about which is what I was looking for!",4
Rebecca Larsen,"Soft fabric, but the waistband is not ideal",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24OJH40K8EKTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWNZ12W3,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"This is a nice set, the fabric is soft and thin but still hangs well. I do not love the waistband. It is thin with a drawstring. Wish it had a thicker waistband, more stretch or yoga style. The top does hang down far enough to cover the waist, but the ties can still be seen unless you tuck them. I am going to keep the set because the fabric and cute capri length of the pants are lovely. Great for warmer weather and cold weather with a layer.",
Sonia,Perfect set for traveling,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KX35X7YS2S3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWNZ12W3,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 2, 2024",Color: Lake BlueSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I bought this set for the main purpose of traveling, and it did not disappointed. Absolutely comfortable, first use was on a 10 hours flight to Greece, and it was perfect. It looks cute, I was able to accommodate on my flight seat very nicely due to the stretchiness of the fabric, it’s thick but not hot, and the pockets are very handy when traveling. While on my 3 weeks trip,  I washed it and it washed perfectly, I wanted to use it again on my returning back home flight, 17 hours from Turkiye. The only drawback I have to say about this set is that I bought a light color and that’s not the best option when traveling.  I will order another set in a darker color.",20

All polyester, which I expected, the fabric is fairly soft, like has the fuzzy stuff inside. It's warm, I got it to wear on a flight, and it was perfect for that. It fits like the photo, though, the legs are short, like above the ankle bone. So they are kind of like wide leg, highwater pants vs a capri, but not really full length. If it wasn't for the weird length, I'd probably wear it all the time.",3
a_shell,Great travel outfit!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SGB2L82XT1YV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWNZ12W3,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 18, 2024",Color: Dark BlueSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I love this travel outfit!

I love that it has pockets. I don't like how it snags easily, but I'm still going to order another set because it looks elegant and classy without looking too dressed up, and it is so comfortable. To help you with estimating the right size to order I am 5'2"", 148 lbs. The pants are a little short, that's probably the style. I just like my pants hem right below my ankle.",2
Jill Ingenito,"Set is so soft, affordable, & versatile",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28PX2ILXBU8A1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWNZ12W3,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 10, 2024",Color: CoffeeSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"The SAMPEEL lounge set is incredibly comfortable and well-suited for lounging or casual outings. The wide-leg crop pants provide ample room for movement and have a flattering fit that complements most body types. They aren’t too tight around the waist, and the elastic waistband allows for some flexibility without feeling restrictive. The mock neck top has a slightly loose, relaxed fit, making it comfortable for all-day wear without feeling too tight around the neck or shoulders. This set is perfect for warm weather, as the fabric is breathable and lightweight.  Style and Versatility:  The mock neck design of the top adds a trendy and slightly formal touch to what would otherwise be a casual lounge set. This makes it versatile—whether you’re wearing it at home, running errands, or dressing it up with accessories for a casual brunch. The wide-leg pants hit just above the ankle, giving the outfit a stylish, modern cropped look. The minimalistic design allows you to pair the set with different shoes (sneakers, sandals, or even flats) to create various looks.  Fabric Quality:  The material of the SAMPEEL lounge set feels soft to the touch. It strikes a nice balance between lightweight and durable, making it perfect for summer wear. The fabric holds up well after washing, and there’s no noticeable shrinkage or fading, which is always a concern with lighter fabrics. However, it’s worth noting that while the fabric is soft and comfortable, it is somewhat thin. For those who prefer a thicker material, this might feel a bit light, but it’s perfect for those hot summer days.  Practicality:  One of the biggest advantages of this set is its practicality. It’s easy to wear, with no zippers or buttons to fuss over. The elastic waistband makes the pants easy to slip on, and the whole outfit feels effortlessly stylish. It also packs well if you’re traveling, as the fabric doesn’t wrinkle much, making it a great option for vacation wear or weekend getaways.  Cons:  • Sheerness: Some users may find the fabric slightly sheer, especially in lighter colors. It’s not overly transparent but might require neutral-colored undergarments to avoid visibility. • Length: The cropped pants might not hit the same length on everyone, depending on height. Taller individuals may find the pants hit higher on the leg than expected, while shorter people might need to hem them for the right look.  Overall, the SAMPEEL Two Piece Set is a great choice for anyone looking for a comfortable yet stylish outfit for summer. It’s breathable, versatile, and easy to dress up or down. The only minor drawback is the thinness of the fabric, which may or may not be an issue depending on personal preferences. If you’re looking for a relaxed, chic summer outfit, this lounge set is a fantastic option that blends comfort with effortless style.",40

Got it in the brown for our warm fall. I have a terrible time due to surgeries and chemotherapy with any pants made in China specifically from Amazon because the elastic waist is always one to two sizes too small and tight compared to buying in a regular store made in China items. Often a medium, which I take, feels like an extra small in the waist cutting into my skin. At the advice of another buyer I purchased the extra large and while it fit perfectly and comfortably I could have gotten away with a regular large, which is closer to a US medium when I compare it and hold it up to true size made clothing like my pants from Anthropologie.

The color is pretty.  The fabric looks expensive.  It has a sheen that I was not expecting.  It is a gift, so she hasn't received it yet.  However, she had picked it out, but I changed the color due to buying her something else similar to the color she had chosen.",
