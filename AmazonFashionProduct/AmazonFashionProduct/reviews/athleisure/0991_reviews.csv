Jess.cozythings,Bigger Than Sized,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14IQMISOAS7J1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF7CWRM7,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Medium,,"I ordered these for my sister to try on and she is typically a medium in loose clothing like sweats, but this 2 piece set was too big for her liking. I recommend you to size down unless you are looking for a baggy fit. Color is a true black so be sure to wash with dark colors for the first time! The set arrived a bit wrinkly but can be smoothed out with proper washing and drying. The inseam is 29"", so for shorter girlies the pants will drape over your shoes. Overall, decent set with average pricing for the material.",

I typically wear black, so when I saw this I had to have it. The color is a true black that hasn’t faded through multiple washes. It’s so comfortable and fit exactly as expected.

The wide-leg cargo pants are the star of this set, offering both comfort and style. They fit like a dream and are perfect for lounging or running errands. The crop sweatshirt, however, is a bit of a mixed bag. While it looks trendy, the jacket is stiff and lays a bit weird. The collar has a mind of its own, popping up if you leave it unzipped. But let’s not forget the zippers—they’re blingy and add a touch of sparkle to your outfit. This set is a cute shopping outfit for those warmer winter days when you want to stay cozy but still look fabulous. Despite the quirks of the jacket, the overall look is trendy and fun. So, if you’re looking for a stylish and comfy set, the Blaosn 2 Piece Outfit is worth a try!",

As for fit, I usually wear a size medium (6-8) but I went for a large in this because I don’t like feeling too tight in those sorts of waistbands, plus I usually size up in outwear, and I love the fit.

UrFavBlackSheep,The pants ruined it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SUQYYW6DYWKP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF7CWRM7,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 11, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Medium,,I got this set and I immediately liked it but then noticed something odd. The top is EXACTLY as described I honestly didn't even notice the pockets on my sleeves until I looked at a photograph. Any way the bottom ruined it because whomever made MY PANTS did the pockets backwards meaning when you stick your hand inside your hand usually goes forward towards your toes but NOT THESE your hands go back towards your buttocks. Now if that were the only problem I might've scored these as a 3-4 but the part with the string is obviously the back of the pants and the back with a label is clearly meant to be oriented towards the front. Since the assembler couldn't get the pieces on the pants in the correct order I now can't wear these without hearing did you put those on backwards? Due to that.. I cannot recommend this garment,
medtraveler1021,Great but not for cold weather,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34NLXDHKEB9CF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF7CWRM7,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 11, 2024",Color: GreySize: Small,,"The matching crop sweatshirt and wide-leg cargo pants are incredibly stylish and comfortable. The fit is perfect, and the fabric is soft and breathable. I love the attention to detail in the design, from the drawstring waist on the pants to the cute ribbed cuffs on the sweatshirt.  While the set is perfect for lounging around the house, I found that the fabric isn't particularly warm. It's great for mild weather, but you might want to layer up if it's chilly outside. Overall, I highly recommend this set for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable outfit.",

I keep ordering everything large because I forget I’ve lost some weight so this time I went with a medium. I will say the medium is still a little bit on the top but since I am curvy and have wide hips the medium bottoms fit perfectly.  It’s a very very comfortable outfit, it’s cute and again the material is amazing and soft.  I will be wearing this often. I love lounge sets!",

First off, the almond color is actually post-it yellow. It also fits a bit large, I should have gone one size down. It’s not a traditional “sweatpants” material, it’s that kind that is soft in the outside and has that stretchy, silky-ish texture inside. The waistband is wide and really high quality. Overall, they aren’t what I thought they would be, but are still cute and comfy.",
