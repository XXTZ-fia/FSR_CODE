I love the high waisted band and how it hides my lower stomach and the stretchy side pocket fits my phone perfectly. It's a stretchy material so it doesn't feel restrictive and you can actually breathe in them. They're super soft too! You can wear these casually or to the gym. While running at the gym I did notice they rode up a little bit it wasn't bad. I usually wear a large but I found the large had too much material for my fit so I went with the medium which Amazon actually recommended for me to begin with lol. I'm 5'3"", 145lbs. These are definitely staying in my regular rotation.",6
