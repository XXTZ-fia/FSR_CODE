Almost. The design looks darling when it’s laid flat. The waistband feels really good when pulling on and when in place. High, supportive, but not restrictive. The length is great- slightly longer in the back creating a really pretty line….. but then you turn around to see the front. The material of this skirt feels like running shorts. Stiff fabric rather than a fabric that has more movement. That causes the pleats on the hips to stick out and look absolutely ridiculous. Remember those Barbie cakes from when you were a kid? The way the cake “dress” looked comically oversized coming off the waist? Yeah, that’s this skirt. The pleats simply have no chance of laying flat. The left side of my skirt also has a seam that runs right up the hip completely preventing those two pleats from pleating so it’s just a flat spot there. I wanted to love this- I really did- but it looks so silly I could simply never wear it in person. 3 stars if you are straighter in the hip and can maybe make this work.",

It’s nice and elastic and VERY very comfortable. Both sides of the shorts have pockets, but they’re more to for a tennis ball than a phone. The shorts have about 2 inches in seem.  I ordered up, based on the size chart, and I guess I’m glad I did since it’s very comfy. I think it would be nice and flattering with a sports bra or some shirt tucked in.  The only reason this gets rated down a star is honestly - it just doesn’t look fabulous on me. I ALWAYS look amazing in a-line skirts, and have a very “hourglass” figure especially on the waist to hips. However - this skirt just isn’t the flattering look I would prefer. I’ll wear it, but won’t expect to pick up a date from it.  Update 7/9/24: I find myself wearing this at least once a week. It’s just so comfy and I figured out how to make it a cute outfit. I’m considering ordering in other colors I like the style so much. It washes well. It has two pockets most of these skorts only have one). I wish the shorts were a bit longer.",3

I got a Medium black and the underneath brief/shorts are great.  They have rubber at the leg openings which keeps them in place.  Don't plan to wear it for sports; other than walking, or running errands.  But being only 5'2"" the length is perfect; alittle shorter than mid thigh.",
