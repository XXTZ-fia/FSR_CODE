I love the cropped fit, but it is a little oversized (which I love). I have seen cheaper items that are the same or very similar, so I would say the price doesn’t equal the value. But I love it!",2

Jessica Robinson,Flattering and comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MR3OPJ83PKKL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CBC3CHY4,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"I loved this hoodie enough to add a second to my wardrobe not long after buying.  The material is thick and cozy enough to keep out a chilly breeze and take the edge of winter cold, but not so thick as to hinder mobility or become insufferably hot indoors. The hoody has a nice wide format that gives you hair space to move freely, and the drawtrings have metal caps on them that matches the metal zipper. And of course the overall shape and design of the hoody is quite flattering.  The metal zipper is sturdy design but is also my main point of contention as it's not a very smooth draw on one of the two I bought and is where a point got docked for me.",4

I normally wear a medium in tops, got this in a large. It's just the right amount of oversized to still be cute. The zipper works well but would have to agree with the other reviews, it's not the best quality. For the price I wasn't expecting much but it's worked well so far. I like how the bottom of the hoodie is fitted also! Worth the buy",
Adrienne,Half price quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJEN3K2QR0B6Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CBC3CHY4,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 26, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Pinkpurple,Verified Purchase,"I’m 5’3, 135 lbs, and I normally wear a size small or xs in jackets. I’m wearing a small here and this one is the pink purple hoodie. I was hoping for a softer and hopefully double lined hoodie but this material is that kind of fabric that has that waffle-ish inner lining- and it’s so thin. If you size up it’s just going to lay flat and long, no thick cute draping here. I had to really adjust it to get it kind of cute. The zipper is worse than bad, don’t buy this if you usually zip your hoodies- it snags on every tooth. Not to mention there’s no fabric fold around the zipper so you get full bright silver zipper in your face- it just looks tacky. The absolute only thing I think these have going for them is there are some colors that are hard to find. This pink purple is pretty, but the quality is not smooth and puffy like you think you are buying. I wouldn’t even buy this if it was $15 and I’m shocked they are charging over $30.",52

For context, I am 5’2, 140 pounds.  I work from home and mostly wear leggings and sweaters. I was looking for something with more of a drop shoulder that wouldn’t be too tight or to loose. It’s tight around the bottom but still loose enough, and then it’s a drop should style. It sits perfectly and my hip bone so it’s not actually crop. It’s extremely comfortable, and cozy. The price is well worth it in my opinion. I bought the gray one first, and literally kept wearing it every day before my husband went and bought me the black one lol.  It even looks super cute with some jeans and sneakers or however you want to match it up. It’s perfect for fall weather or being inside a house for the cold girlies.  Definitely buy!",10

The light grey color was just what I wanted. I’m probably gonna order more colors! I really like the inside material - it’s not the fleece type. I got it in Small even though Amazon recommended Medium..and I think it’s the perfect size. The length of the sleeves were nice and long down to my fingers. It has a loose fit. Length is at my hips.

At first, I ordered the hoodie in gray and black. I took a chance on ordering two to start because they looked super comfy yet super flattering. The material isn’t exactly what I expected, but it keeps me super warm and cozy throughout the day! The hoodie isn’t as thick as I thought, but that being said, I wouldn’t say it’s thin either. It’s a nice medium weight. I pretty much wear sweats or yoga pants throughout the day since I work from home but when I do go out, I pair it with a Cami and a pair of jeans and it’s super cute. As far as color accuracy goes I’m unsure because I only ordered it in black and gray, but I will definitely have to come back and update the review if I order more colors! I have my eye on the blue purple, pink and coffee gray! Needless to say, these hoodies have won my heart!",3
Rachde,"Overall, Good; But, Zipper Issues",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QP7KW3L5UPBL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CBC3CHY4,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 3, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,"This is a quality sweatshirt. The inside is not fuzzy, but it is exactly the type of sweatshirt I was looking for. The hood is awesome, the baggy-ness is the right kind. The weight of the fabric is just right. It doesn’t feel cheap and thin. I would recommend this. The only critique I have is that the zipper kinda sucks - it gets stuck going up or down, definitely not a high quality zipper, which is surprising cause everything else feels super high quality. But, because of everything else, I’d buy this again and feel good about my purchase. The zipper still works, it’s just not great.",

This can be worn so many different ways & while it’s not the most comfortable fabric, it’s not terrible either. I bought this to wear with a sports bra & leggings on my flight & I think it will be perfect. Very lightweight but keeps you at a comfortable temperature.
