I’m and 12/14 size typically and buy xl as I don’t like tops fitting tightly around my mid-section. This large fit perfect though. 5’0”, 155#, 38DD. Fits great. I’d love other colors. Size large. I gave it 4 stars because the orange is not what I had expected. Florescent orange, so I’m not sure I’m keeping this. It is a thin sweatshirt. It’s not soft on the inside, so I wouldn’t say it is a true sweatshirt like what i think the majority of us picture a sweatshirt to feel like. The zipper detail is cute and I will definitely get another color.",20
Nicholle,One of the best buys this year,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HO1U8O002P39/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC6F1D2D,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 10, 2024",Color: Royal BlueSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"UPDATE: I loved this so much that I bought the Kelly green, black, and wine colored. I love all of them except the wine colored one. The color does not reflect what’s represented. It looks more burnt red than a rich burgundy. Also it runs big so after getting the blue in XXL, I downsized to XL for the others. Great buy. The gold zippers make it look like a quality product . The wine colored one—not so much. See pics. ****************************************************** I had to order more colors of this stylish shirt bc it drapes very nicely and gives a “boxy” body type some nice lines. The color is brilliant. The zipper is quality. The shirt has some warmth w/o being heavy. It’s very well made. It runs big so get your true size. Seriously grab all of the colors you want bc it’s a great shirt. My favorite this year so far.",5

The zipper is very well made. One thing to keep in mind when ordering. This is, as it states, ""Oversized"". If you wear extra large, get a large. If you wear a large, get a medium, if you wear medium, get a small. It will STILL be oversized. I am 5'8"" 138 lbs. I do like my sweatshirts on the roomy size so I started with a Large. WAY too big.

I bought some in my real size (XL) because I’m 5’3/220lb size 16 curvy/big boobs, and some in Large.  The XL fit “oversized” so not clingy at all.  The large was more “fitted”, but in a good way.  Also- the side zippers are functional and on both sizes, I unzipped them half way for a cute “swingy” look. With my high waist jeans and leggings leaving the zipper slightly open adds a cute look. I’m a short gal, but have a long torso, and these still covered my bum (a must for me When I wear leggings!) plus a few inches.  If you carry your weight in your belly, get your true size.  If you are more “hourglass” with your weight distribution more even, size down.  But even if you size down, the zippers will allow you to lessen the clinginess.Quality: are these a cuddle up fleece? No. But are they comfy? You betcha! Just because I want to wear leggings, doesn’t mean I always want to look like I rolled out of bed.  These sweatshirts are what I consider to be the “elevated” kind that instantly makes you look “put together”.  Want  casual? Throw some sneaks on.  Want classy? Throw some pointy toe flats, booties or even heals/wedges.  I’ve worn them both ways and have gotten compliments on the shirts.  People like the colors, and the gold zippers really show up and make this a “dressy” sweatshirt.  I hate calling it a sweatshirt.  It’s really so much better than that.These work for everyone.  I’m  a 44 year old mom/teacher and have 2 teen girls.  One of my teens (145 lbs 5’5) has borrowed them twice now.  On her the XL was way too oversized, but she loved the L fit and wore the pink one to school with sneakers and said friends and a teacher loved it.  :)",55

The blue was as expected.I think these sweatshirts are a very nice dupe of the Varley Manning style, of which I own two in black and charcoal grey.  The difference is the Varley is a more substantial, heavier fabric and the side zippers are a nicer quality.
