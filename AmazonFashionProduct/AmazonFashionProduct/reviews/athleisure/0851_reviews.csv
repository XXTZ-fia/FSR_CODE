I'm approx 10/12 women's sizes and bought a Large in the heather grey.

Very soft inside & out and keeps me warm. No problems so far w/zipper that I've seen in other reviews. Happy w/my purchase & bought @ Black Friday deal price, so def worth $26 + change! The only minor suggestion would be that I wish they would make the pockets deeper - like the place where you put your hand in could be a smaller fit, extra loose for small hands and shallow for keeping your phone/might slip out easily.",2

I’ve been looking for a cute and versatile full zip option, and this is it! I ordered my typical size - it fits a little on the looser side, which is what I wanted. I know a lot of people mentioned issues with the zipper - it’s a little hard to get started, but mine works just fine. Here are a few more of my thoughts after wearing this one a few times:  Pros - extremely soft, slightly oversized fit without being too baggy, pockets are pretty big but not bulky, looks good zipped or unzipped, wears well with jeans or leggings  Cons - the inner lining behind the zipper is really large and makes it lay a little bit funky (you can kind of see in the picture with the zipper open), falls off the shoulder when zipped (but it’s actually kind of cute and could be considered a pro too lol), zipper is a little hard to get started  I haven’t washed this one yet, so we’ll see how it holds up! Overall, I think I’ve worn this for about three days straight since I got it. Definitely recommend!  Update: I didn’t have any issues when I ran this through the washer. I did also air dry it because I didn’t want it to shrink or lose any of the softness. I think running it through the washer might be where you see shedding so if you end up doing that, just be advised!",101

The band on the second jacket was a noticeably different color too. Therefore, it is going back.

It sits on the waist so if you want a dropped waist look, go bigger. The fabric around the cuffs puffs out, and has a decent sized hood and makes it looks fitted but loose.(it’s so cute!) I went down a size like the reviews say and I can still fit layers underneath and not look bulked up so that’s a plus! It’s still a loose fit, but not bulky. ONE TINY THING….the sleeves. I usually have this problem so maybe it’s me, but the sleeves are a pinch too short. Nothing noticeable… maybe like a quarter of an inch too short. I think I have longer arms, hence a me problem.

She loves the fit..u would think it's a medium the way it fits her but she doesnt have to sacrifice the length. (She likes how my mediums fit(the room they give her), but they r a little too long for her, I'm 3"" taller). Shes 5'4"", 110 lbs, small framed through the shoulders (I would call her petite build, and 5'4""). The ONLY consideration is the color. She ordered red. The red on our monitor appeared to be a brick red. We got a bright true red (tomato red). But she kept it due to fit, SOFTNESS!!, and mid-weight to thick(ish). Her real reason to buy was due to thickish weight...tired of buying these flimsy jackets that look cute but have ZERO warmth and/or softness. Shes all into Cozy!",13

You could use it as a tent almost. It’s so good for cold nights by a campfire or an early morning dog run.  It is oversized but not schlumpy. The lower shoulders, the subtle balloon sleeves, and the way it comes in at the waist but not in a way that restricts you… it’s great!  I wash in cold and hang dry because I want it to keep its softness.  I was looking at those $80 yoga hoodies but was nervous to buy one because of returns. This seems better to me in every way, including price. I have had no issue with the zipper or the strings and I’ve camped in this all summer.

Bridget I. Proulx,Almost like lululemon!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTOAW5J6A0AD7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09H3ZWV3S,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 25, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Pink,Verified Purchase,This product is so spongy and comfy. It is very thick but also made it a breathable material. It is almost like lululemon but a quarter of the price. I really like the color and the product itself. I recommend if you looking for a more affordable nice hoodie.,
Brianna Clancy,"Color not as advertised, but comfy",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2A0WTA206BT3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09H3ZWV3S,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Pink,Verified Purchase,"This sweatshirt is comfy and I was very pleasantly surprised to see how long the sleeves are! The pink though is not a true baby pink like it seems in the picture. Much more orange in there, like a pale coral color.",
Regina yoder,Love this jacket!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NWHTV0UPREKS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09H3ZWV3S,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 23, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Lightgreen,Verified Purchase,This is my favorite jacket. It’s warm and comfortable. One of my friends stained my 1st jacket so i bought another one. My one complaint is that on my second green jacket the zipper was kinda cheesy. It now won’t zip up and I had only worn it a few times. Other then that the jacket itself is great! The first tan one was perfect and the zipper still works almost a year later.,
Dakota,New Favorite Hoodie!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IVRJK1AVY5R2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09H3ZWV3S,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,"This is the best hoodie! I got a large because I like the oversized look and it really does well. You can wear it high and make it an off the shoulder crop hoodie or pull it down to cover the bloat. It is super duper soft and has the perfect amount of thickness which is great for winter. The quality of material and oversized style really makes this jacket so great. It’s cute and I love the color. Goes pairs well with jeans and leggings and if you’re really feeling loungy a nice baggy pair of joggers. Great with black, grays, blues, pinks, greens, and white.",15
