But not this set! I was so pleasantly surprised, the material is soft and comfortable, the collar of the shirt stands up as pictured, and the length is just right (ordered size M, I am 5’4”). Only drawback is the waist, its pretty tight although I like that the waistband is flat in front (not ruched). So basically have to wear the waistband at your true waist to be comfortable. But I otherwise love it and can deal with the waistband issue. Will be great for travel. Got it on black Friday sale which was a great deal for this product.",6

When I did, however, I noticed that the pants are about an inch too short. It doesn’t look terrible, but it’s not quite my personal taste. When I went back and looked at the reviews. I noticed that everyone that said that the length was perfect was 5’2” and I’m 5’3” (whomp whomp) I’ve decided to keep it however because I really think it’s so comfortable and it’s fine to WFH, carpool, etc. but the Tyler folks may want a size up. I am going to get a second set, but I will be getting a medium and not a small..",4

The seller was very kind and responded. I sent pictures and they told me to request a refund. While waiting, I ordered the burgundy set which is beautiful and both legs are the same length. I feel that the green was a manufactured mess up. The seller made the green unavailable so I’m not returning mine, I’ll just get the legs altered. When I tell you that the green color is sooooo rich and beautiful that I can not send it back without a replacement. Maybe they will get it right and start selling the green again. I give this set a 10.  This is a beautiful lounging set, however one pants leg is longer than the other. I would return it but I wore it trying to make it work. If it was the same I would give it a 10. I pray that the owners will see this and make it right. I would love to purchase every color because it is beautiful material and the color is very rich. Hopefully this was a mishap and they will make good on this purchase hard. If they do I will give an update and change my review.",
