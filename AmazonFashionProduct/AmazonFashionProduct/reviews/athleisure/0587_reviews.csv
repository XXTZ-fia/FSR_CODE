The side pockets fit my iPhone. I did have issues with the waist rolling a little during some yoga exercises, but for the most part everything stays in place. The construction of the pants is flattering. I really like these. I have machine washed in cold water with a low tumble dry without issue.",4

Ariana Evans,The perfect legging,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RAQOQTYOP0UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCKPHPG,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 25, 2024",,,"These soft leggings are stretchy and very comfortable.  The high waist with compression material actually makes my belly look a little smaller.  They work perfectly in the gym as they were very flexible in all my workouts.  They stayed at the ankles and didn’t inch up my legs.  The side pockets are fairly small, but I can fit my iPhone in it.  I washed these in cold water and hung to dry.  There was no shrinkage and they remained their shape.  I used their sizing chart and they are true to size.  Overall, I think these are quality leggings that are perfect for everyday activities.",3

First of all, and most important as a mother of 4, there is no annoying tight waistband at the top to squeeze your stomach. They are stretchy and comfortable and stay up all day. You can do deep squats without anything being see-through (at least in the color I got). They are smooth and great quality. Overall I totally recommend for workouts or even just lounging.",3

Lynn,Shaping/tight on waist which is not to my liking,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GGG4AZ7M8NL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCKPHPG,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 11, 2024",Fit Type: RegularSize: LargeColor: Deep Navy,,"Overall I really like these leggings. The fabric is really smooth and comfortable, and it's a medium thickness, and seems really high quality. I washed these leggings in warm water and dried on medium heat and they did well - no shrinking.  I got these in large and while they fit TTS they are definitely a ""shaping"" type of legging so they are a little bit tight on my waist. For me, personally, I just hate having things be tight on my waist. I have an apple body shape and have a round belly, so these aren't the most comfortable for me there. I am 5'4"" and about 150 lbs. I usually get a large in leggings to try to make things be slightly looser on the waist, but I guess in these I should have gone to an XL even though they fit well everywhere else.",

They're a good thickness so I can use them for running or yoga without feeling self-conscious. They fit really well, too. The size chart is accurate.

I have a similar style pair that is grey and expected them to be similarly built but they aren't. These are made from a much softer, stretchier, and more breathable. Another thing that makes this pair better than the one I have is the comfortability of the scrunch area. My other pair tends to ride up and sit too tightly in the back but these are super comfortable in that area. It also has a pocket in the back that would fit a phone. Overall a great pair of yoga pants!",
