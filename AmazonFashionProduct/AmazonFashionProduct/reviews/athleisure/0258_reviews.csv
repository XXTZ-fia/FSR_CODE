Like others reviewers mentioned, this khaki leopard color is more like a brown leopard. Still cute, but darker. The quality is made really well, you can see that there are seams that reinforce the fabric so it lasts long. The torso area is comfy because there’s a little bit of room. The fit looks beautiful and I want to buy more. I can tell this won’t shrink.

Ordered a large; the band of the inner bra is bigger overall, but it's like they didn't make the fabric itself bigger, so it feels loose in the back and still too small for my boobs up front.

I have lat muscles so I often order a 10 in Lulu but I can wear an 8 (the shelf bra is smaller and it isn’t as appealing on the lat fat). This fits in between an 8 and 10 from Lululemon for me because it doesn’t squeeze and fits my 36c comfortably. The band doesn’t ride up and the material is soft.

I first ordered an extra large, which fit beautifully everywhere except for the band of the bra portion. It was so loose my boobs kept falling out the bottom. It was so very loose that I returned it and reordered a medium. Well, the band on this one is tight enough, but everything else is way tighter as well. I couldn't maneuver into it over my head so I had to put it on by stepping into it. That is not a big deal, but the way it gave me a bunch of cleavage I didn't really want and fit tightly enough everywhere that I'm not sure I can do yoga in it, which is what I bought it for, is a fair sized issue. I can't decide whether to keep this one, and the other in a different pattern that I noticed was only available in medium so I got it too, or return them for a large. I'm really doubtful the large would have a tight enough band, because the band on the medium is just barely tight enough. If I wanted to spend the money, I would reorder an extra large and have the band taken in. It's cute enough that I'm actually considering that. Darn that band, though.  Edited to add that the band on the large was more too large than the band on the medium, as I expected. I am in fact keeping the extra large and having my seamstress do something about the bra band, because it is just too cute. But they really need to reconsider their sizing on the bra band. Just the bra band",4
