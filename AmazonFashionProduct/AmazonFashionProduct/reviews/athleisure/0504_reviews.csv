The inner short could be improved with a better compression fabric so a tighter fit could be achieved.  There is one interior pocket that my phone bounced around in but I got used to during my run.  I would prefer a pocket on each side not just one.  The headline description says ""pockets"" but there is only one singular pocket on the right side.  If you are a lefty then I guess these may not be the shorts for you.  I found the grips on the legs pretty useless as well.  If the inner liner were just a bit longer,  the grips would probably function as intended.  So far I like the functionality of the all in motion shorts from target the best, but the cut/appearance of this short is less flouncy and more flattering on me.",

I ran for miles and it felt secure the whole way, even with me taking it out and putting it back mid run. The pocket is great. The material is breathable. I was in warm weather and felt great. I love the color. The downside is that for me they rode up a lot while running and therefore wouldn't prevent thigh chafing on long runs. This is actually the main reason I thought the 2 in one design would be good. The outside layer actually helped more than the inner layer I thought would. I understand that probably not everyone has this problem, so I'm sure they're great if not. It annoyed me to keep worrying about pulling them down while trying to focus on more important things like pace and breathing. I only took off one star since that's a specific problem that doesn't necessarily reflect poorly on the product. I'll still wear them lounging or walking or possibly even easy bike riding but they're just not the running shorts I needed.",14

I missed my return window so I do not know if I would be happier with a smaller size. With it being extremely large on me they pooch up in the front due to the extra material. I may try ordering a smaller size in the future. The material has a great stretch and seems to be very well made. The color and pattern is vibrant and absolutely beautiful The inner tight leggings portion is super breathable and stretchy. It also has rubber along the bottom to help keep them down. Love the adjustable waist band. Helps customize the waist fit. The side pocket is stretchy and holds my phone plus other items with ease.  Main thing I do not like: The sides are not slit open. They are sewn closed. I prefer the shorts that have the split. I find it easier to access the pocket with the split.",13
