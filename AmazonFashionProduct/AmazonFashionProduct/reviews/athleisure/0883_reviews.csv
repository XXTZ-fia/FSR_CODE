Lorraine,Was too long for me,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I6FDS57GCQU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CVVQ7WDJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 30, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Beige,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely loved this sweater, but had to return because it was too long. I’m 5’2, 113lbs, and have a 25 inch waist. I got size small. It definitely feels oversized, which I love. The arm length and everything was perfect. The length of it though was past halfway my thighs so it made my legs look really short. It’s a bummer because it’s a great sweater. The quality feels thick, the inside is very soft and warm. For the price I think it’s worth it if on sale. If you have a longer torso or on the taller side, it’ll fit you great!",
Shannon A.,Love this sweatshirt!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIGQCQV87IJBX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CVVQ7WDJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,"I purchased both the medium and the large to see which size I preferred. For reference, I'm 5'7"", 150lbs, athletic build. The medium fit perfectly fine and I almost kept it, but ultimately decided to go with the large for a more oversized fit. With the medium, the sleeves came to my wrists but were slightly too short to comfortably use the thumbholes (if you don't plan on using the thumbholes you'll be fine). Ultimately, I'm very happy that I went with the large. It's super comfy and cozy. So far I've washed this twice on the cold cycle, then I laid flat to dry to minimize shrinkage. So far it's holding up well.",3

It still allows me to wear a heavy shirt under it.  I purchased the orange color to wear while walking my dog in the woods during hunting season and it is perfect to be seen.  I like the form fit of the sleeves with gathered fitting at the wrists to prevent wind from entering at the arms.  While I usually don’t like half zip sweatshirts, this one provides a big enough opening with the zipper down to easily slip over your head without wrecking your hair (lol).  I also like the large center pocket because I could carry a regular water bottle it it without it falling out.  It has a fleece warm inner lining and when you zip it up it covers a snug fit around your neck.  I don’t like hooded sweatshirts, so this was the perfect find.  I like it so much I plan to buy another one.",4

The oversized fit gives it a cozy vibe, and I really appreciate the front pockets; they’re a great touch for keeping my hands warm or storing small items. It’s perfect for lounging around the house or running errands, making it a staple in my wardrobe.  What I Disliked: I honestly don’t have any major complaints. It’s just what I was looking for in a casual sweatshirt!  Overall, I highly recommend this half zip sweatshirt for anyone seeking comfort and style!",5
