Sandra,Not the Same,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18X3ZYB2K7JR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DQJHS4WD,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 25, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: A Spinach Green,Verified Purchase,"I purchased the Blue & Sail Blue in an XL.  I'm 5'8"", 195 lbs.  I love this sweatshirt!  It's more of a French terry, which I like because it's not so heavy.  It's soft & has a nice stretch.  The bottom is nice & loose and the fit is just slightly boxy.  It fits my 40D chest nicely.  The side slits are a nice touch.  I liked them so much I ordered the Spinach Green.  The reason for the title, Not the Same, is because this color is a different fabric.  While the 2 blue ones were 95% poly, 5% Spandex, the Spinach Green one is 50% cotton & 50% poly.  Totally different fabric.  It is heavier & obviously has no stretch.  So the fit feels more ""snug"".  Also the color is darker than what shows on Amazon.  I'm keeping it because it's an ok sweatshirt, I just don't love it like the other 2.",44

Sort of a sweatshirt but a little more thin. That said, I like it. It is not fuzzy. It can go with jeans or leggings. Obviously not ideal for nicer events or evenings out or work when you need something nice. But great casual shirt. I will buy more in more colors. Update: So I did buy a couple of these. One issue is that they stain SUPER easily and when I try to use stain remover to get the stains out, it discolors the shirt. It is such an issue that I can't buy anymore even though I like the fit and the material because essentially the shirt is nearly unwearable once you get one thing on it. I am not that un-messy, especially in a shirt that is not going to be a dress shirt, so I down graded it from five to four stars. I have this in red, blue, teal, gray, and yellow but I can only wear the gray because the others got stained and/or discolored from my efforts to remove said stains which don't come out of this mateiral very easily at all.",19

The color I ordered (Spinach) wasn't flattering on me.  I thought it looked like a grayish green, but no, it really is the color of Spinach.  In order to have it drape over my bum, I ordered a large.  It did the trick there, but then the arms were too long and overly boxy in torso.  It will be lovely on a slimmer, taller body type.",

I have no idea why this is a “frequently returned item”…..I have bought 5! They do come vacuum sealed when they are shipped so they are very wrinkled at first.
