The pants are perfect length and super comfortable. Thicker material so good for colder New England weather.  My mom complimented me on the sweatpants and she is not a casual/active wear type lady. The shoulder detail on the top elevate the look from a typical half zip sweatshirt.  I’m 5’5 and 170 and the Medium was perfect. I’ve washed several times already and the garment still looks great which was a welcome surprise considering the great deal I got purchasing the set on sale.I would absolutely buy from this brand again. Honestly my favorite sweat suit to wear right now.,

If you want a more tailored fit, I’ve found that a large works best, but the XL drapes a bit longer and offers extra room for a relaxed, cozy vibe. What I love most is the versatility—you can easily dress it up or down. It’s a 10/10 for me! Save your money and grab this set, you won’t regret it!",

Definitely recommend checking the sizing chart carefully, because it helped her get the exact fit she wanted.  The design is cute and stylish—the half-zip sweatshirt paired with the wide-leg sweatpants gives it a trendy, modern look, while still feeling casual enough for everyday wear.

Material is very soft and the fleece is soft and not scratchy like cheap fleece is.  The material and stitching is extremely well made and quality feeling. It looks cute but maybe not for wider shoulders? It is wrinkled when you first get it but after I washed it they came out and didn't wrinkle when I ran into the dryer. I did notice that it didn't seem to fit like you would think an oversized sweat suit would fit so I should have ordered my usual size instead of sizing down. For a looser fit which is what I would want in a sweat suit I would have ordered a medium but because it says oversized in the description I decided to order actual size which is a small and although it fits it's a tad snug. Overall I think it's a good value and a beautiful and quality of the sweat suit.,

It’s a bit modern for my style, but I thought it would be a nice change, and I’m pleased with what arrived.  The material is very soft and comfortable and will keep me suitably warm. I like that it can be worn as separates, as I can see myself using the bottoms regularly at home. Size-wise, it runs a bit big unless you’re planning to wear more than two layers underneath.  The only reason I’m docking a star is that I feel like the drawstring rope is not particularly high quality and might snap. Also, I prefer pants to be more streamlined and not wide at the end, but this is a personal preference. Also be warned this comes out of the packaging rather creased, so you will need to iron out the kinks before wearing, but it’s also a preview of what will happen if you pack it in a suitcase.",6

The fleece material is thick and very soft without being too warm. It's been great in these transitional fall days where it's cool in the morning and evening, but warm during the day. I like the extra details on the sweatshirt that make it stand out from your basic sweatsuit. The ruffle (for lack of a better word) on the shoulders give a nice silhouette and make it look higher end. I also like that the zipper can be opened quite low to provide for those fluctuations in temperature during this time of year. I wear it with a tank top or t-shirt underneath, so it actually adds another layer of dimension when I open the zipper, which I like. The pants are high waisted and quite long, but I'm used to that since I'm on the shorter side (5'4''). The pants also run a bit on the smaller side; they aren't quite as stretchy as I'd expect, but they are still comfortable on me and I wear them all day without any issues (I wear a size L, 5'4'' and 180 lbs.).

Good news, this fits quite well. I am 5'7"", 133 lbs and have a slender build. I wear a 27 waist so I stuck to the sizing chart. The pant legs end pretty close to the ground so that makes me quite happy! This set is super soft on the inside, and is loose and well fitting. I really like the extra detail on the shoulders that make this set just a tad different from all the others currently on trend.",2

K. A. R.,"Soft and cozy, but the pants remind me of 70's bell bottoms",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RW0D71LEF1CDN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7M5ZNFN,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 21, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Ashleigh Blue,,"This is a soft and cozy set that will keep me warm in winter. It's well made as far as stitching goes, and the blue is a pretty color. There are two design elements I could have lived without. The fins (I don't know what they're called, but that's what they look like to me) on the top are a little larger than they look like in the set the model is wearing. They kind of look like something in a Star Trek episode...lol. They're not terrible, just.......different.  But what's really strange is the bell bottom pants. We're talking huge, 70's bell bottoms; the kind that cover your shoes front to back and drag on the ground. I didn't like that style in the 70's and I don't like it now, so I will definitely be tailoring the pants to be more of a straight leg style and the proper length, instead of dragging on the ground. Other than the pant legs, I do like this set; otherwise I wouldn't take the time to fix them. Looking again at the model on the description, her pant legs are not nearly as wide, nor long, as the set I received; I suspect they adjusted the pair the model wore. Someone else posted a picture of the set which shows the pants-mine look exactly like that, only in blue. I don't know what the designer was thinking, but suggest they rethink that part and make the legs like a regular straight leg style. I'll soon be fixing my pair and then I'll really like the set.  Because of this issue, I can't honestly recommend them, unless they fix the pants. The legs are way too large and long, although the waist is a perfect fit.",

Normally I order Large, but this one I ordered the XL for a gangsta fit, which is super loose… and I love it! If I had ordered the Large, it still will have been a loose fitting, since it appears these run bigger and looser than normal sizing, so staying with your regular size will be casually loose, or even sizing down if wanting a more fitted look.  The material is substantially thick, huggable soft and super comfortable. The design of the top is unique and really cool looking, and the zippered collar is perfect whether zipped or not. The legs on the bottoms are super wide (12”wide on the XL) and are way long, resting on the floor like a gown. The soft materials and quality of this set are excellent.",7
