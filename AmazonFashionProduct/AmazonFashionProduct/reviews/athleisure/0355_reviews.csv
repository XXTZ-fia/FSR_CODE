Odd though I purchased another color as well and that shirt was larger so each shirt may be a little off. For reference I'm 5""5', 142 and 34d.  The shirt isn't as soft as I would like and it flares out at the hips a bit making mine look bigger which I do not like but overall it is good.  EDIT: I can't seem to write a separate review for the orange shirt. The color is way off on it, instead of a pretty softer peachy orange it is actually bright fluorescent orange. Not a fan of it and only keeping it because it was on clearance for a good price.",2
