FY,Comfortable and Pretty,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R585USC8WRKMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CV3BVFK,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 26, 2018",,Verified Purchase,"I love this because the material is stretchy  and comfy, and the skirt is long enough that I can wear it on an errand yet short enough that I can wear it to yoga. I also love that it’s athletic yet feminine. I am 5’8” and slender. I always buy leggings a size up just because I like them to be a little bit loose and comfy. I would take a small but I like the extra room in the medium. It definitely fits true or even generous; I’d have been comfortable in the small. I have another brand of skirted legging that is binding and so short skirted that I could only wear it to yoga and not on the street (if being modest). This brand is much better inmho, but it won’t provide a firm Spanx effect if that’s what you’re looking for.",14
Jeanie B.,So soft and the skirt over my butt is the best.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NPF6SQB08LG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CV3BVFK,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 25, 2024",,Verified Purchase,I get asked about these all the time.

Super soft, fit great... the only surprise (which is not All that bad) is the fabric is kinda see through. Luckily the leggings have a skirt to give double coverage!

I would suggest you stick to the black because the seam in the interior layer is quite visible. It's comfortable but thin. I also bought small and medium and the medium was a little large.

I can't wait to buy more in different colors.  I have a hard time with leggings that cut into me at the waist and these are really different. The skirt part is just like a really long yoga waist, so they aren't tight at all. But they don't fall down either. There's no seam or elastic at the top, just very stretchy material.  EDIT: The fabric is very susceptible to snagging or pulling, like a pair of nylons. I've got a big pull that goes all the way across one thigh after wearing for a few hours. BUT still super comfy !",5
Lupita,Ii did not like the material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLS4DZ6IUN31N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CV3BVFK,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 1, 2018",Size: X-LargeColor: Dark Grey,Verified Purchase,"The idea of a miniskirt legging is cute but the material is not flattering for my body thickness. not sure what material this is but its not your typical cotton legging like the ones you get at H&M or Target (Cotton?).

I have tried them on, but not had an opportunity to wear them out. A few things to know when ordering these: They are more lightly ruched than the pictures show. So, you will get more of a miniskirt look, which I prefer. They are not foldover. That is evident from the picture, but the name is misleading. They are very soft. I really look forward to wearing them. Do note that they are hand wash. That's not a problem for me, since I hand wash a fair portion of my clothing. But if you need a wash-and-go item, this would not be it.  Overall, I'm very pleased, and hope to wear these a great deal.",30

Glad I did b/c I love these. They are SO soft and very comfortable. They do feel like pajama leggings, as other reviews have mentioned, but I've worn them out and to yoga/pilates classes. I have worn them over a dozen times, hand washed them twice, and so far so good. A couple issues - the black die rubs off of these. I wore them to bed one night and my sheets were discolored afterwards. Beware of that. Also, there is some pilling in the inner thigh area, but you know, my thighs rub together, so I get that :).",4

The ""forest green"" color is . kind of a deep teal, I love it.  However, they tore on my first wear!! so bummed that now I'll have to replace return or repair them.

They are not compression. If that’s what you’re looking for, these are not the ones for you. But neither do they hang off you, like some reviews have said, at least if you buy the right size.

I can't believe they were so inexpensive! They're flattering in spite of the pandemic 20 I put on (and I'm having trouble breaking all of the habits that helped put them on).  I noticed that some customers said these are hand wash only. I usually run hand wash items in the wash on delicate with woolite- so I'll try that and see if they survive.  I just lost some very expensive layering shirts to holes earlier than expected- so it's not all price- sometimes it's just cheap fabrics and cautious washing. I'll see how they survive.",
