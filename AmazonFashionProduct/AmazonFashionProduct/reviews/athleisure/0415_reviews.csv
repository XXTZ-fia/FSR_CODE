In the past with other Amazon brand clothing items I've noticed inconsistency in the products.  I have shirts I ordered from the same listing same time and they are all different sizes and fits. I was really hoping these pants would be the same as the black and quality hadn't changed.  Unfortunately they changed.  The blue pair I received has much thinner material.  It's less stretchy.  I compared waistband sizes and the blue are about 2 inches smaller than the black.  The elastic in the blue feels awful.  It feels cheap and it doesn't stretch at all.  They had a good thing going with these and like all things Amazon they had to change it up for worse quality items.  Won't be buying again",21
