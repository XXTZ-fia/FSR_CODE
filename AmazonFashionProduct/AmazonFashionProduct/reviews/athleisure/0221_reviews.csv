The pieces are short seamed, so be prepared to make repairs.  The pants are comfortable with nice wide legs. The top is a nice length with a crew neckline.  I prefer a v-neck; I think that is a more flattering look.  The pants come in only one length.  I am 5’ tall and had to cut off about 4” and still hem them with a 1” hem.  Overall, they are good for daily running around.  I expect they will last a season.  I probably won’t reorder them.",5
