KsCuzin,A cute print and a cute style…but the armholes are cut odd.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DVLMG6CMR11C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BXDMG3PG,"3.0 "," the United States "," April 29, 2023",Size: SmallColor: White Camo,,"This LURANEE tank top is a cute print. The material is soft and stretchy. I chose a size small, based on the bust measurements for each size. In person the color is as shown in the listing, and the fit is as I expected. The armholes are cut oddly, so they protrude slightly on the front. The construction of the top is otherwise good, with no notable issues such as fabric flaws, seam rips, or messy/missed stitches, etc. I do like the neutral white and gray camo print, as it’s versatile enough to wear with a large variety of colors on the bottom. I always wash clothes prior to wearing them, so this was washed on warm with a delicates bag on gentle cycle. It was then hung on a drying rack to air dry. It dried with no fading, shrinking or pilling. I do like the comfort, camo print and stretch of this front-twist top. I find the front crossed hem to be a unique look and very flattering. In addition to the issues with the armholes, if I could change just one small thing, it would be to eliminate the continuation of the band at the hem on the back. I don’t care for the look of it or the way it hangs on my body, but it doesn’t really affect how it fits or wears. It’s just a personal preference. Overall I like this top, but question how much I’ll wear it with the protruding armholes. I really wanted to give a glowing recommendation for the LURANEE workout tank, but due to the issue with the armholes, I can’t wholeheartedly recommend it. IF having the armholes stick out a little on the front wouldn’t bother you or you’ll be wearing a jacket over it, then this top is cute and it may be just what you need. But for me, I’ll get my wear out of this one, but likely won’t order another one.",2

In a stretchy top like this, I’d usually order a size Large, but in this one, I ordered size XL. I am: 6’tall, 42” Bust, 34” Waist, 46” Hips, approximately 190-195 lbs.  The XL fits a bit big, especially in the armpits, but does have a comfortable fit across my larger bust and tummy area, so I’m happy about that. With my sewing machine, it’s a quick and easy alteration to take in the armpit seam. I actually do this quite a lot, usually with dresses, as when I size up to accommodate my wider hips and thighs, the bust area is often too big.  Love the print, twist front and breathable fabric. Good quality and I feel happy wearing this 😄, so I expect to get a lot of wear out of this one and do highly recommend 👍🏻🥇🐆",

There was so much extra room around the arm holes, and it was wide at the chest although still tight across the upper back and the front of my chest. The crossover being in the front makes it a weird length. For the cut of the shirt, I think a racer back would have been more flattering/worked better for the style. It is an athletic material, but it could be more wicking and lighter weight if I had to change it. Overall it will work fine for working out, but the shape and fit are a bit strange. The white camo is pretty in person, though. I'm 5'3"" 140lbs and 32F for reference.",10
