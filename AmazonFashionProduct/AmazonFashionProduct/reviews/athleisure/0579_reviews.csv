mesh,Love these shorts,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16GCN7RZTHN84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SDR9TWV,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 17, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"I love everything about these shorts. I find them to be super comfortable & wear them doing pretty much anything~as far as exercise I walk only, I don’t wear these for intensive activity. Initially I went by the sizing chart based on my waist & hip~which was a large. For me they were too large & fit oddly. They were nothing I wanted. I gave the navy blue a shot with a medium. Now I’m 160-165lbs but losing. My weight is in my butt. I loved how the mediums fit. I do have to pull them up in the back on occasion but I’m ok with that because I love how they fit every other place. The inner lining I have no problem with. If I had thicker thighs I could see how that would be a problem but I don’t. I love the drawstring. I material is 90% polyester & 10% spandex so there is a little bit of a stretch to them. The inner pocket does hold my XR iPhone with no problem at all. I only use the pocket for my cell on occasion. I love the pocket though, it’s great for keys, cash, a credit card. Because of my measurements I don’t know how helpful my review is for you. The way these wear on me is my personal preference. I like them tighter & they’re not uncomfortable. I’ve purchased other colors but only kept the navy blue & black. The ash blue material coloring were different shades & I didn’t like the look. I took a chance on the white but felt they were too see through. So I’m happy with the 2 colors I have. I was them on cold on the hand wash cycle & hang them to dry. There were no issues with stitching or loose strings. They wash great & after drying they are set to go. So this is my experience with these shorts. I’ve waited to write a review because I wanted to wear & wash to see the true quality. For me they are a quality short & I’m happy with what I paid for them. I hope my pictures are helpful. I recommend them but feel due to the style & sizing they may not be everyone’s favorite shorts.",14
Me,Good quality.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UCQOOCN4YI6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SDR9TWV,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 10, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Wine,Verified Purchase,"This is my 3rd pair of these shorts in the last 2 months. Very well made, have all 3 colors available as I need multiple for everyday exerciser and all around comfort during these hot months. Love that I can put my phone in the “Skorts” underneath in the side pocket, right thigh and it firmly stays with no movement or fear of lose. A definite WIN WIN WIN in my book, I might order a couple more black pears, so I have every day covered, and also as black as my favorite color for shorts. If they had more solid colors (hint hint hint manufacturer!!!) I would order them. Thank you for the unparalleled design and thought into this clothing item. GREAT JOB!!!",
tabitha,Very comfortable and beautiful print,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2W00VP53OMYJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SDR9TWV,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 11, 2022",,Verified Purchase,"5'5"" ; 150ish lbs ; 37"" hip ; 32"" waist Ordered a size Large and WAY too big. I missed my return window so I do not know if I would be happier with a smaller size. With it being extremely large on me they pooch up in the front due to the extra material. I may try ordering a smaller size in the future. The material has a great stretch and seems to be very well made. The color and pattern is vibrant and absolutely beautiful The inner tight leggings portion is super breathable and stretchy. It also has rubber along the bottom to help keep them down. Love the adjustable waist band. Helps customize the waist fit. The side pocket is stretchy and holds my phone plus other items with ease.  Main thing I do not like: The sides are not slit open. They are sewn closed. I prefer the shorts that have the split. I find it easier to access the pocket with the split.",13
Karie,Flattering but weak liner and pocket,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D7R4PV2VU3I5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SDR9TWV,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 26, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black Grey Non-slip Belt,Verified Purchase,"I liked the fit of these shorts, I am 117 lbs, 5 foot 5.  The inner short could be improved with a better compression fabric so a tighter fit could be achieved.  There is one interior pocket that my phone bounced around in but I got used to during my run.  I would prefer a pocket on each side not just one.  The headline description says ""pockets"" but there is only one singular pocket on the right side.  If you are a lefty then I guess these may not be the shorts for you.  I found the grips on the legs pretty useless as well.  If the inner liner were just a bit longer,  the grips would probably function as intended.  So far I like the functionality of the all in motion shorts from target the best, but the cut/appearance of this short is less flouncy and more flattering on me.",
Jill P,So nice and comfy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PKCSSX9OT19T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SDR9TWV,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 7, 2020",,Verified Purchase,"These shorts are INCREDIBLY comfortable! They are very light and breathable.  Even though several reviews said it fits as expected or larger, being a plus size woman, I tend to lean on the side of caution and ordered a size up. I’m ok with the fact that I did, but it wasn’t necessary.  As most reviews have also said, the under layer isn’t tight fitting, either. I’m ok with that, but if you’re going to actually use these for running, then you might want a tighter fit. And it’s not a tight-woven spandex. It’s thinner.  The pocket is only in the right side (not sure if that was in the description) but it fits my iPhone XR nicely.  I plan on buying another pair or two, but in my regular size.",7

I'm a curvy size 8-10 with a booty. I need shorts that are quick dry, comfortable and great for walking in with the family in Texas heat, but also a cover up at the pool/water parks. I ordered a Medium in the maroon color. In love! I love the liner and it doesn't ride up. However, if you are prone to thigh chaffing, I will day these won't save you from it due the length of the liner. These are a snug fit and I like it that way so when I swim in them, they won't ride down or fall off.  I did order a Large in the black so I had something more for physical therapy days and work outs. Not sure why but they fit a bit tighter than the medium. The tag definitely says large on it.. So, I'm hoping it was a fluke and going to reorder the black in XL.",2
Review Girl,Genius design,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FTWC2C33ESX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SDR9TWV,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 16, 2020",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I was expecting for these shorts to be worn in the privacy of my own home - strictly for lounging. However, to my pleasant surprise they are great looking and comfortable enough to wear while running errands and working out. LOVE THE HIDDEN POCKET! This day in age, we carry our phones everywhere. We NEED pockets for them. Yes, women’s clothing, I’m speaking to you! Men’s fashion has always included pockets (even PJ’s)! Our phones are accessed so many times per hour that it’s not something that I want to put in a purse. Need more pockets in clothing. This is a great way to keep up with your phone while active or not. My iPhone 11 Pro fits securely in the pocket (in the under layer of the shorts - which are NOT skin tight or uncomfortable as most are). Bend, move, stretch and workout while your easily accessible phone is secure in a pocket that is large enough to comfortably hold the phone without it dropping out. I also appreciate that the pocket is NOT over the buttocks. I can comfortably sit and lie down without sitting on the phone. I’m getting another pair because I think they’re genius!",2
Anna,Comfy but not quite what I needed,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHAS6CNJ2UFUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SDR9TWV,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 12, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"I'll start with what I liked. The material is nice and soft. They're very comfy. I got them for running and the pocket. The pocket holds my phone well. I ran for miles and it felt secure the whole way, even with me taking it out and putting it back mid run. The pocket is great. The material is breathable. I was in warm weather and felt great. I love the color. The downside is that for me they rode up a lot while running and therefore wouldn't prevent thigh chafing on long runs. This is actually the main reason I thought the 2 in one design would be good. The outside layer actually helped more than the inner layer I thought would. I understand that probably not everyone has this problem, so I'm sure they're great if not. It annoyed me to keep worrying about pulling them down while trying to focus on more important things like pace and breathing. I only took off one star since that's a specific problem that doesn't necessarily reflect poorly on the product. I'll still wear them lounging or walking or possibly even easy bike riding but they're just not the running shorts I needed.",14

The pocket sits under the outer part of the shorts within the lining.  The lining is very soft, a little heavy but not too bad. The shorts overall are comfortable but would be interested to see what a large would fit like (not sure if they would be baggy in the front or not so keeping the medium).  I ordered a medium which is what I normally wear (5'5 130ish). They are very comfortable and soft, just wish they were more true to size. I estimate they are about a half size too small if that makes sense.",

Rose,Comfy yet not forgiving.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R43X2U6CZQ6MX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SDR9TWV,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 18, 2020",,Verified Purchase,I have to agree with the other reviewers these shorts are SUPER comfy.  But the undershort is to flimsy to hold a phone comfortably while doing a lot of movements like running or HIIT workouts.  I'm 5'4 and 171 lbs.  These shorts aren't very forgiving of that either.  But they definitely are comfy and that is always a plus in my book.  So if you have much cellulite on your hips and thighs like I do and you are very self conscious of it maybe get a different pair.  But if you are like me and know that every body is different and your working on your body and sometimes need to be reminded of that then these might do the trick!  They are helping me stay focused to get to my goal weight.  Down 85 pounds since last Aug.  So I'm not too worried about this.  Heck last year I wouldn't have been able to even wear these shorts!!  Im happy.,232

Definitely cannot use these shorts to run in with the phone in the hidden pocket. My phone fell out within the first quarter of a mile and hit the pavement. I think the phone would stay just while walking, but it certainly isn’t a snug fit by any means. It bounces around and against your leg.  As you can see in the photo I uploaded, the drawstring is incredibly long. No idea why anyone would need a drawstring in that length. Once I tied it, it was easy to just slip inside the shorts - and because of the inner shorts liner, it wouldn’t come falling out the leg. So it wouldn’t be completely kill it for me if that’s all that was wrong with these shorts.

They were tighter around my waist and the shorts underneath were very loose.  I thought they would be more like compression or even spandex shorts, but they weren't, and I have a big butt and thighs for my waist size.  Aside from that, they are light weight and comfortable for around the house, but probably not great for real exercise.",

The pocket is not useful as it is angled wrong, you would need arms in the back of you to use it.

They are pretty comfortable overall, and I really loved the fact that it had a pocket for your phone which is extremely helpful. However, the spandex portion constantly rides up. It does not stay in place. It is not tight so it is not keeping itself down. Then the whole shorts ride up. I am pretty disappointed because I have one pair of shorts from a different company that stay in place but have no idea where I got them!",2

I didnt like the 5 ft long drawstring or the amount of elastic on the waist. I wanted a soft waist and didn't take a good look, my fault. I like the pocket and liner short, but the pocket bounces up and down with my phone. I want something more tight to the skin. However these are great for lounging and walking. Foe running I would recommend something more comfortable at the waist with tighter pocket.",19

The “compression” shorts underneath do not compress very well and ride up. Otherwise they are comfortable and the hidden pocket is nifty. I believe I bought the correct size. I usually wear a small and I was worried if they would be too small. If you can, size down. I would try again if they had an Xtra Small.",
