Topaz,"Very thin, lightweight material.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3F0WLQU5ZQFG5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BQ2R7WDY,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 18, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Light Purple,Verified Purchase,"The jacket’s material is much thinner than I expected, especially for the price, but it’s well made, looks great on, and is perfect for a summer coverup over a tank top or sports bra. I am 5’7” and 160 lbs. The large fits well and I don’t feel like a stuffed sausage. I could go down a size but I’m happy with the mobility of this size. It has 4 pockets and very nice quality zippers. The pocket zippers are pretty and dainty. I’ll def be buying more! They come in a wide range of pretty colors, I wish they had dark purple, red, and a few other deeper and richer colors as well cuz I can only do light hues for so long… 😂 I highly recommend!",44
Eve S.,I love this lightweight SPF jacket,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1G0IGHVIXAFMJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BQ2R7WDY,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 3, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Navy,Verified Purchase,"Lightweight, and not too hot, perfect for cool mornings or sun protection on a warmer day.

Jesseekab,"Runs big, pale color",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SDCTFF8Y6SPR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BQ2R7WDY,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 27, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Fluorescent Yellow,Verified Purchase,"This is a nice lightweight material that would definitely be useful for hiking, running, day out with the family, etc. I personally bought it because I wear neon on family outings so my little ones are able to spot me easily.  The material is very stretchy, but shows everything underneath. I'm 5'1, 156 lbs, 42-38-43. Worth noting this isn't my usual size but I had a baby recently, so I ordered a size large because of my bust size, and the bust was the most fitted part of it, but it was big everywhere else, and I imagine would be too big in the bust once I stop breastfeeding. I wish I'd gone with my usual size medium, but with how stretchy and long it is, I think I probably could have pulled off a small if it were a bit thicker.  It would have served the purpose of my family being able to spot me in crowded places, but I neither loved how baggy it seemed, nor how oddly unforgiving it was, showing every detail of what I was wearing underneath, nor how long it was- this is not for someone with a short torso. Also, the color was definitely paler than expected for neon, like if pastel neon is a thing then this would be it. So, I returned it, but I will say the material was very lightweight and comfortable.",20

My only minus is how it looks on my 5'1"" frame.  It is a bit long and looks a little strange on me because of it.  Other than that it functions well and the pockets inside and outside are very useful.",4

PickySenior 128,Magcomsen light jacket with 4 pockets,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21XH1J88ST6U1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BQ2R7WDY,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 22, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Blue Green,Verified Purchase,"The lightweight blue Magcomsen jacket I ordered arrived on time. Though it's a nice blue color, the brighter light made it look grey. I ordered a size bigger, XL because I may layer when I travel or go outside. It's UPF 50, protecting against UV radiation from the sun. I like the fiber because it easily dries, doesn't require ironing, and has tiny holes which allows the skin to ""breathe"". The hue is the perfect shade of blue. Its sleeves are a bit longer but that's a minor thing. The sleeves have a thumb hole to fully protect from the sun. It also has 2 outside zippered pockets & 2 inner ones. I can't emphasize enough the value of pockets when traveling. This jacket is quite useful when traveling or living in sunny places. It's lightweight, so it's convenient to add to a backpack or carry on bag. Recommended.",13
