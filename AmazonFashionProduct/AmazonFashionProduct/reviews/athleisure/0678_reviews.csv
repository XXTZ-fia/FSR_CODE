I like that the leggings are very high waisted so there is not a lot of skin showing but that’s just my personal preference.

Was expecting us to be blush pink but it’s definitely pretty dark. The overall fit though fits very well so I’m going to try to make it work since I ordered these for a photo shoot. The leggings are a little long however I am 5’3” with a 28” inseam. I don’t mind since I’ll be using us for yoga but if you mind they are pretty long. I was actually quite surprised with how much the garment stretched because when I removed it out of the packaging I thought it was too small but it fits perfect! Wish the color matched but so far I love the fit. As far as squirrel proof this color is a squat proof I can’t say the same for the other colors. Only 4 stars cuz color is way off.,19
