If you are looking for a sweatshirt that will keep you warm without layers, this may not do the trick.  It's definitely considered a lightweight sweatshirt/heavy duty cotton long sleeve T-shirt type material/style.  The neckline, it does not fit tight to the neck like a regular sweatshirt normally does. If you are not comfortable exposing much of your neck line area, a regular T-shirt worn underneath will definitely give you that added coverage/comfort.  The neckline is not loose or baggy, does not droop down, but it is not formfitting to the neckline area either.  This is a true two XL for women. It fits a little big in the sleeve area and I believe around the neck line area front and back neck line.  But I would not feel comfortable going down his size. Well, I might if I try it on first. To do a compare/contrast.  The color is bright and fashionable.  The length is perfect if you want to wear a pair of leggings and get coverage for the bum/stomach area-I wear a regular T-shirt underneath for layering/more comfortability/coverage. But you may be completely fine as is or with a tank top underneath.  All in all, this lightweight sweatshirt, is fashionable, very soft and comfortable, great price for the quality. Very pleased with this item and would definitely recommend it, buy it as a gift for a fellow tie-dye lover, even in a different color for myself.",2

According to her, there is MUCH to love about this sweatshirt and pretty much nothing to dislike about it. Here is what she likes:  - The sizing was spot on. Especially when ordering plus sizes, you never know if what you order is actually going to fit as it should. This sweatshirt fits my wife perfectly, which is so appreciated. - The sweatshirt is cute! My wife is a fan of tie-dye, and if you are too, then you will love this. The colors are subtle, though, so it's not too bright and attention grabbing. - This feels good when worn. The material on the inside of the sweatshirt is so soft against the skin, and this is great for keeping warm in this colder fall weather.  Definitely recommend this sweatshirt!",
