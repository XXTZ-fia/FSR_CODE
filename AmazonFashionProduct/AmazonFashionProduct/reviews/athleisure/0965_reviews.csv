I’ve had great success with the CRZ Yoga Butterlift leggings, but this shirt misses the mark. The quality is giving paper napkin. But that might be doing a disservice to napkins. There were also lots of loose strings around the seams.  I love the fit of the shirt. The tunic style is just right and the boatneck is stylish. But in order for me to recommend this shirt to someone else, the brand would have to significantly improve the quality of the fabric. Overall I am disappointed and wish I’d spent more money on something that didn’t feel so cheaply made.",

I appreciate the length in the back as they cover everything I want covered. (I’m in my 50’s but they’re great for any age) The wider neckline flatters my body type. I do not like crew necks, I can appear to be wearing a table cloth. The fabric is super soft and they hold up well thru countless wash cycles. I rate this shirt 5 stars and all thumbs up.",

First, the fabric. Even though it’s mostly cotton, it feels very much like a purely synthetic material on me. I prefer natural fabrics, and this one just doesn’t feel like one. Second, it fits really strange around the neck. As I walk and move around, the shirt creeps up my neck to the point where I’m constantly pulling it down. If the fabric was different, maybe I wouldn’t notice it as much, but as is, it annoys me to no end. Overall, when I wear this thing, I am acutely aware of having it on, and I can’t wait to take it off. They clearly tried to create a specific look and design, but didn’t quite make it. In my opinion, the pattern is all wrong.",

This ""band"" has visible seams and really doesn't add anything to the shirt it just makes the center wider. So with that being said, I think this is the reason this top runs big.
