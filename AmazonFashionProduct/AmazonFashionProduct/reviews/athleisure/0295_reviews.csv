They are the same thin, slick, polyamide/spandex as a lot of yoga pants and we were disappointed. That said, we liked the fit. We have long, thin legs, so they are a little loose in the thighs (curvy girls might like that) but we are pleased at how long they are, like all the way to our feet and we have to tug them over our heels long. Long-legged ladies will understand how rare that is! They look nice enough to wear out of the house with a cute top, maybe even to a casual restaurant and they're wrinkle-resistant. We haven't washed them yet, but we don't expect them to shrink, although over time and many washings the spandex could stretch out like it sometimes does so we probably will always dry them on avery low heat setting. We're keeping them, but still looking for something similar in a cotton blend.",3

She loved them and we ordered the camo for her as well.  It is a nice dark camo that isn't flashy but a bit more exciting than plain black.

Fabric keeps me warm but not hot. Great for traveling or lounging. Even though I usually buy petite, the length is not a problem because it is slim fit and gathers at the ankle.  While the pants are casual, they can be dressed up with a top or jacket. I bought a medium and small. They both work, but I prefer a little more form fitting, so I’ll go with small in the future.",2

I've gained a lot of weight pretty quickly because there's a shortage with my medication. I'm usually a medium weighing between 145 and 150 lbs at 5'6"" so that's what I bought. It was my mistake for not weighing myself before purchasing the pants. Currently I'm 157lbs and though the medium feels comfy and not too tight, It does show off my cellulite on my butt and upper thighs.  If you're my weight and height with very little to no cellulite in these areas, a medium will probably look great on you. Just keep in mind it still won't have as baggy of a look as on the model If you have thicker hips and thighs. If this was my normal weight, I would return the medium for a large as I'm pretty sure that would give me a much better fit and hide the areas I'm self-conscious about. I took a star off because I personally did not like the hemming of the pockets. They stand out a lot more in person while in the pictures, they appeared smoother and less noticeable.  Overall, they seem like nice soft comfy pants. I haven't ran in them or washed them yet so I cannot comment on the durability and whether or not they pill.",52

Figured they'd be great for just lounging around the house or running quick errands - and they are that, buuuuuut they have also become a STAPLE in my workout collection! Comfy, buttery (legit!) soft material that hugs alllll the right areas (like the thighs and booty) but a bit looser in the knees and calves - so they're basically like looser leggings LOL. Anyway, I'm pretty muscular in those key areas so I guess if you have a leaner frame they could hang/sag on you a bit more, but just make sure you follow the sizing chart, because the chart was pretty on point for me. The material itself like I said is buttery soft but it is lightweight so I wouldn't call these ""winter"" friendly if you're going to wear them outdoors during that season. The crotch doesn't sag at all for me & is very comfy at the waist - not tight/digging but also does not fall/slide down. Overall, you will NOT regret buying these.

I’m 5’8 1/2” and 135#. Hips measure 37”. I wear a small to medium in Athleta brand of this helps. Pants are not thin which is nice. Taking them out of the package they looked sooo small at the hips but stretchy material so they actually fit. Look slightly snugger than model and a little shorter. I got the longer style. Ordering the grey next but may try a medium. The only slightly loose area is behind the knee. Otherwise fits more like leggings if this is how you want them. I’d go medium if you want anything looser.  Addendum : wanted to try the grey and blue but only a size large left. Believe it or not they fit too but just looser in the legs like the model. I usually like a 32” inseam and wish these were longer. Hit about 3-4” above the ankle like 7/8 leggings. I’ll have to bring back the scrunchy sock trend of the 80’s if I want to wear these in the winter!  Another addendum: the largest kept slipping down so gave them to a friend. Ordered a medium in the graffiti and the olive green. Different material than the other black cameo ones. Fit a lot looser in the front area where a pant zipper would be and not as compressive of a material. Don’t expect that different colors will be the same material I guess. The grey large that I had were kind of shiny but not baggy in the zipper area and they were a size bigger!,155

A thicker fabric than leggings, I feel covered.  Flattering fit, excellent length (5’6”).  The rise is above the stomach below the belly button.  Wash well and no peeling/fade after dozens of washes.",8
Amazon Customer,Like buttah,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZZ05AMSK26UC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09TGY2WHX,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2022",Size: MediumColor: Joggers78-black,Verified Purchase,"These pants are amazing. I’m 5’8” and they fit just above the ankles, but for the type and style of jogger they are I don’t mind. I’m 140lbs and bought a size M. They are extremely soft and I swear I could live in these. They have a nice wide waistband that’s very comfortable and doesn’t cut into you at all. They are stretchy and forgiving; very opaque and don’t show any cellulite or anything. The pockets are great too and hold my large cell phone without dragging the pants off of me, and without the phone falling out of my pockets when I walk or move about. They don’t stretch out either and leave those unflattering stretchy knees like some other pants. I usually wear them for running errands but have also worn them to work out and they are just as stretchy and comfy as tights. Best of all they feel like butter - I’m right now ordering another pair!!",7

Very “buttery” soft. Functioning pockets. As a busy mom chasing a toddler while carrying a newborn, love the relaxed look of them compared to regular leggings.

Judi Satran,Amazingly just like the name brands!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KLXQE7DDG3XK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09TGY2WHX,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 25, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"I never write reviews but I always appreciate people who do! It’s hard to know if what you’re buying online (when it’s ‘cheap’) will really be good. But I must say these are the MOST comfortable pants. So stretchy, but hold their shape. So much more affordable than other popular name brands. I own both Viori and Lululemon and these are very comparable.  The pockets are deep so phone and keys don’t fall out when you sit down. Not too big of pockets (not too much material) that makes your hips look weird and puffy. The high thicker waistband holds you in and fits flat, so tee shirts or tanks don’t bunch up. And no weird look in the crotch area. Washed well. No shrinkage although I hang to dry.  I really love these pants and my husband says they “really flatter my figure”. Gotta love that!  I tried both extra small and small and they are very close in feel, but I preferred the extra small. Less material in the hip area. I’m 5’2 110lbs.",30

Blackheart,"Very nice quality pants, very generously shaped",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36IEQILM8CPTW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09TGY2WHX,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2021",Size: X-SmallColor: Joggers78-black,Verified Purchase,"I am about 5'2"", 105#, and these pants were much too large for me. The waist was OK, and the length was doable (they were full length on me, but at my height I expect that), but the hips and legs are extremely generous. I wasn't expecting leggings, but I wanted slim tapered joggers and these weren't it. If you are small-waisted but quite curvy, which I am definitely not, you will probably like these.  The garment quality seems stellar. They are not super thick, but substantial. They are not warm or lined in any way. I think the material would be very flattering if I had the body these pants were designed for. I guess I am not shaped like a dragon.",3
