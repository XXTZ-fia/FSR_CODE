Great for all seasons. True to size. And decent size pockets!  However, different colors have a different material feel and weight and sizing is inconsistent. I loved the navy blue feel/weight and fit in medium but so far other colors have been very different. More silky, thinner, and run small.

Mi have a little bit of a belly so the 2xl fits my waist very very comfortable!!! I like that they aren’t so thick. They can be worn in fall and summer and spring where I live but winter may require something underneath them like leggings. I really love them. I hope they don’t shrink. They did not have a smell. The color is ok. The red is not a true red. It’s a brushed soft red. They are not are through. The price was good. I may get more.,10

The calf's don't ride up like traditional pajamas and the waist doesn't get twisted. They don't feel heavy but they keep your legs warm. They wash well, but they definitely need to be dried on a medium setting or lower, otherwise they'll shrink. I've already purchased several additional colors. I love wearing them around the house, if I'm running to pick up my grocery order or prescriptions  I really like these, they're perfect for wearing at home or just running errands. At first I thought they were going to be way too long, but after washing (cold) and drying (medium) they're great. They're not baggy as described, but not too tight. They do loosen up around the calf. If you're looking for something to keep your warm, these probably aren't what you need. I live in the south and we've had an earlier than usual cool spell and theyre perfect for the weather here. I think they'll be perfect to wear for sleeping in the fall and winter since it's so hard to find pajamas that aren't too long for my height. My favorite color is the blue heather, but I like the others I got and will probably buy additional colors in the future.",14

They don’t seem to be attracted to the lighter colors. Perhaps spray the dark colored before going outdoors in the evening. (At least you don’t have bug spray on your skin) These would not be suitable for winter in any climate. I am a more small person and I wanted them baggy so I got the medium, however the medium was a little too snug for me around the waste.

I'm in my late 60s, and wore a size XS-S my entire adult life, until about two years ago when I graduated to Medium in some items (depending on brand).
