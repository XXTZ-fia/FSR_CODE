Bookworm,Amazon's size instructions were wrong.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KRR7CXQNDPJZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08SQH1N91,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 8, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I love this shirt. I had ordered other shirts just like this one before, and I love them all. With this shirt Amazon suggested that I should order size Large based on millions of other shoppers that are similar to me, ... or something like that. - I followed Amazon's advice, even though I had always purchased Small and Medium shirts before. It turns out the Large is too big for me. Amazon does not have a clue about the size. Follow your instincts! I love the shirt, I am keeping it, it is just a little too big. But since I wear it when I work out it does not matter that much.",

Judy B,I now own three,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRRMCMKCN3J5W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08SQH1N91,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 14, 2024",,,"I needed quick-drying, lightweight and comfortable tops for Pickleball in the Florida summer, while also being useful for Pilates. I like the longer tunic style with short sleeves to cover my upper arms, mid-section and hips as I'm a 'mature' woman who is shapely so-to-speak.  Also, V-neck is a must as this neckline is the least restrictive and most attractive with it's elongating effect. I have a relatively small waist but 36DD bust and very hippy. All the tunic styles that I tried were snug around the hips so they would bunch up during exercise and poof around my lower stomach. This style is just a bit roomier in the hips creating a slight but flattering flare. The side black insets at the waist create the effect of indention and is very flattering for any shape. I've washed my first 2 shirts multiple times - in the washing machine, but then I hang them to dry vs. putting them in the dryer (per instructions on the tag). There has been no shrinkage and the jaspe pattern and colors still look like new. I now own three of these in different colors - they are my go-to workout uniform and worth every penny.",
