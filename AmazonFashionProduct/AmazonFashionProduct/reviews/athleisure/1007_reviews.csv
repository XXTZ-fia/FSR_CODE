This shirt is perfect! The material is wonderful! It is soft and it drapes nicely. I could even dress it up and wear it to go out and it's perfect for the gym. It is slightly sheer but not see through (which I actually wanted to show off my sports bra a little). It is well made and it shapes the body just perfectly. I generally buy a small or a medium depending on how I want the shirt to fit. I'm a 34D and I bought a medium and it does fit a little big on the armpit sides. I won't be returning this one but when I purchase again (which I certainly will) I will probably select a small. If you're thinking about it, just buy it, you won't regret it.",

Jenny,"🤣  this is the thinnest ""opaque"" shirt I have ever bought and that is saying a lot!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PPEVNNW1OCBR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SWJHBJZ,"1.0 "," the United States "," July 25, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I understand this is supposed to be an exercise shirt, which would imply it is breathable and it is because it's THIN AS FARK... but ... it's not made of active wear material (the black one is 70% modal, 30% polyester) which makes it look and feel incredibly cheap.  I did buy it with the intent of using it as a workout top so it shouldn't matter so much that the coverage is poor, I really just don't like feeling like I'm being taken advantage of when it comes to price and quality. At the time of purchase, this shirt is being sold for $20 and it is honestly worth $10 (even with inflation and all those shenanigans). This shirt does not spark joy.  As far as the fit, it does seem to run on the smaller side (this is not a problem I usually have-- I do try lots of clothes-- so I'm assuming it is the shirt and not me gaining weight). It is not cut in a flattering way-- i.e. the back fits well like if I bought the next size up then the back opening would look large and awkward-- but there is no flow or movement in the front of this shirt. If you are bloated in any way it will show.",

I aired dried it and it seemed to take forever to dry. Not a good sign for a workout shirt. Also both times I wore it and I got sweaty, that really strange smell came back. I know it’s not me because none of my other clothes smell this way. Whenever it gets wet it stinks really bad. Thinking of getting rid of it or just not using it to work out in.

Got stained because I sprayed perfume on me like I do with every other piece of clothing I own, but it stained the shirt and it would not come off.
