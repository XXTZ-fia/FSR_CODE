Linné,Buttery Soft 🧈…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20ZQUADHCHA2R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCJFRMT,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 20, 2024",Size: X-SmallColor: Elemental Blue,Verified Purchase,"I get overwhelmed with the endless amounts of workout leggings online and never ended up getting new ones. Although for my holiday trip, I decided I must at least get one and thought Amazon should come in handy. After a bit of research I stumbled upon this product and based on its high ratings/reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I ordered the periwinkle blue to match with a sports bra I already owned. I didn’t realize how buttery soft these leggings were and am absolutely head over heels about them. They felt super comfortable on the skin with plenty of stretch. I was a bit nervous ordering XS (which is my normal size) but one never knows how a size chart flows and especially ordering on Amazon, but it worked out perfectly. All in all, I’d recommend these.",2

These however, take ""light"" to a different level, as they're more like a pair of ankle length underwear. I like leggings that breathe, but that also lend some shape and contour. Sadly, these missed every mark for me, and I was the second person to return them. I only know that as they came repackaged in a baggie with no labels or tags.",
FunLuvr,"Soft and great fit, no pockets",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1M3B20DJRVLDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCJFRMT,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Burgundy,,"Since I basically live in leggings, I am always scrolling in search of the next pair and I landed on the YITTY yoga pants/leggings. These are terrific! They move well and are super comfortable, whether I’m actually working out or they are just the pants I put on.  The fit is true to size. I got these as the holiday season ramped up (Halloween!), so I ordered a large rather than a medium and they fit very well, without any pinching at the waistband. The high-rise design stays in place throughout workouts and daily wear—there’s no constant need to pull them up or adjust them. The fabric is soft yet durable, with a slightly slick finish. The material provides decent compression, so I get a smooth look without feeling suffocating or revealing every ripple.  These leggings have a clean, sleek design with minimal branding, which I like for versatility. The lack of pockets is my main complaint—while I don’t always need them, they are useful for holding my phone when walking or working out. They wash well and haven’t shown any signs of pilling or fading after multiple trips through the washer and dryer.  I’m really happy with these leggings. They fit, are soft, and look great.",

The crossover high-waisted design is incredibly flattering, giving a sleek, sculpted look while staying securely in place during workouts or casual wear. The 7/8 length is perfect—it hits just above the ankle, making it ideal for a polished look with sneakers or sandals.  The deep navy color is stunning and versatile, easily pairing with anything in my wardrobe. These leggings have quickly become my favorite for yoga, errands, or lounging. They wash well without fading or losing their shape, which is a big plus.  Definitely recommend!!",
