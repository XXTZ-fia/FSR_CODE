Until I went to hang it up (after a few hours of use) and I couldn’t zipper it. I’m so mad because I can’t even return it! I personally don’t sweat so I had not washed it before noticing the zipper was damaged for those that will ask that. But any case it is a very thick 2 piece set. I would we’re together or separate, now it’s just a waste of money I’m going to have to give away. Very sadden because I’ve bought from only this brand on Amazon specifically because they are so good!! You can tell I just took it out and though it own to take the kids here.

The shorts have a very thick waist band. The waist band has 3 rows of bulky sweatshirt material stitched. If the waist band was not so bulky and uncomfortable, I might wear them. I doubt I will ever wear them though and will probably donate them instead. I do like the sweatshirts a lot. They are soft and the half zip up works well. I got a size small and it fits like a standard large. I probably could have gotten the extra small, but I like the oversized look.",2

The top is oversized- at first I thought it was too big because I'm not use to wearing oversized, but after giving it a shot I really like it.  Bottoms feel like a normal small- at times even a bit snug on the waist. If you have larger hips the bottoms could potentially feel tight. Depending on body types it may be difficult to find the right size in this.  Overall, good quality, cute, comfy and cozy set, keeps you warm but not sweaty.  I'd buy again.",12
