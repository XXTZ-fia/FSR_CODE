It's TALL GIRL FRIENDLY...I'm '5-8"" and 210 lbs and as you can see, the pants hits the floor...Great 2. The set is a little sheer/thin...I would recommend a black or skin tone under garment when wearing 3. It's just comfy and soft. The material is stretchy and warm...Just very comfy..The color is a true pink....Baby girl pink color. If I had to do errands I would wear a long jacket or flowing sweater to cover up the sheer parts...It's not a deal breaker for me...I will keep it and probably get another color...I just so happened to like it alot... And YES the waist is a little narrow...but if you wear a nice snatching undergarment you'll be fine if you have a little/lot of belly...I was fine with it...I dont...But don't let that stop you from buying this set...It's nice. Did I mention it does hug your curves...Hubby approved!! I recommend this set....GET IT !",20
