Tee,Will do the job,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1B2XML94MLCO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSC8C98Y,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 19, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Set 2,Verified Purchase,Decent quality and light fabric. I also like the variety of colours. It looks great with high-waisted leggings and is a comfortable looser fit. But seems to be an awkward length on me. It’s not a significant issue though and I will be keeping them.,
Anon1,Very cute but poor quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RI5B1MFBURWOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSC8C98Y,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 17, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Set 1,Verified Purchase,I loved these when I first got them! After a few weeks sadly they started to come apart at the seams on the sides.,
SnarkBythePage,Great for Workouts,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIVY20SMZTMA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSC8C98Y,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 27, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Set 5,,These shirts are great for the gym or great for layering under a sweater or crewneck. The sizing seems correct and the fabric is soft and comfortable. The stitching seems secure and I see no damage from the initial washing. I love that they are lightweight but not see-through. The colors are vibrant and cute. The small detailing on the front adds just the right amount of visual interest to make these shirts a step up from a boring crop top.,2
Bella,Different style,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3772AU2OQI9DC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSC8C98Y,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 1, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Set 8,,"This is a nice set of shirts that looks nice as casual wear. I did not notice the tie in the front when I ordered these and if I had then I might have decided differently, but I’m glad I gave these a try because they are comfortable and have a great color variety!",
Jarboe fam,Cute design but purely made with holes in the stitching,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R245J9PI4FLBLP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSC8C98Y,"2.0 "," the United States "," April 19, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Set 3,Verified Purchase,"(My brother and I share this amazon account. This review is from me, the sister.) The first time I ordered these tops I loved the fit and design. They are a very thin material but somehow not see-through at all. But there was a huge hole under the arm of the black-colored top where the stitching had come undone. I returned and reordered again, but the next pack that came had the exact same problem. A big hole under the arm of the green-colored top. A cute design but evidently very poorly made. This wasn’t a one-time mistake, it was a pattern both times. And it now makes me wonder if it will rip at the seams easily even if they’re isn’t a hole to start with. Don’t waste your money!",
Rosemary,Cropped t,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK4W2XDZMIQNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSC8C98Y,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 17, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Set 2,,This cropped twisted t is nice in the several colors it comes in.  On me it’s very cropped.  It just goes a bit below the breasts.  On my daughter it goes almost to her waistband.  The shirt is 2 sizes bigger than she wears but looks very cute baggy as well.  On both her and I it fits and the little waistband is straight and accentuates it.  The cloth is a thin athletic type cloth (the quick dry kind).  They are made well and are soft.,3
g,Bad,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX73DR7HI4HL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSC8C98Y,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Set 1,Verified Purchase,"This product is so bad. When I opened up the bag these shirts came it , well let’s just say they smelled awful and I could not get the sent out in the wash. They also came in an terribly cheap material so I would not recommend buying these.",
Jenna Wylie,Love love love these shirts,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PPIJXRCJLINH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSC8C98Y,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 17, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Set 6,,"These shirts are super comfortable and soft. I love them. They are easy to wear, they are not my type of shirt to wear to workout but thats because I am always stinky and sweaty at the gym. However, I would wear them to do casual stuff such as grocery shopping or running errands. I love them. And love that there is a set of 5.",
Amber W.,They’re cute in theory but poorly made,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1347Y3RYVB2KI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSC8C98Y,"1.0 "," the United States "," July 23, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Set 3,Verified Purchase,The seams immediately started to unravel on both sides even though I got a size too large for comfort. The sewing is not great. They are sadly cheap and will not withstand more than one wear.,
Alma,Iffy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2V840W8353QNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSC8C98Y,"3.0 "," the United States "," April 25, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Set 1,,"I can appreciate the intention of this set, the colors are great and they’re perfect for the gym or exercising. The material is thin and helps to cool down you down. However the knot in the middle is a bit awkward and causes a weird bump that makes me very self conscious. Maybe side twist would be more complimentary.",
JeriLynn Roberts,"Good fit, soft material!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIEBJ6C1E20PK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSC8C98Y,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 17, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Set 5,,"Fit true to size, lose fit so size down if you want a more fitted, crop fit. Good colors and quality material, comfortable and soft, although some colors are a little more sheer than others. Great value pack!",
Jo,Athletic/soft fabric - great fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LZ5U9DJ5RA5N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSC8C98Y,"3.0 "," the United States "," April 8, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Set 8,,These shirts are so comfortable! They're very soft and adorable. The knot is a little weird and the fabric is oddly loose but I'm able to fix it by pulling the fabric inside the shirt. It's a little weird though because there is a hem line were the knot is and it almost makes it seem like two shirts were sewn together instead of a smooth knot effect.,
Amanda Osborne,So Adorable!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2N42S4VHDJVRB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSC8C98Y,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 9, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Set 6,,These crop shirts are absolutely adorable! Medium fits as expected - not skin tight and not too loose. Our teenage daughter is 5’4” and 140 pounds and she ordered a medium. Great value for how many you get - dress them up or down…great for working out! They are buttery soft and the colors are soft. They have just enough stretch in them as to not be rigid. So comfy and I may be getting some for myself!,
Tim & Tammy,Nice pocket,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D7UD96LJSTTY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSC8C98Y,"2.0 "," the United States "," April 22, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Set 2,,I like the different varieties that they actually fit I used to have not center it stuck out like an acorn,

Comes as a 5 pack with different colors. Fit her perfectly with no need to size up or down from her regular. Its a very soft material.,
