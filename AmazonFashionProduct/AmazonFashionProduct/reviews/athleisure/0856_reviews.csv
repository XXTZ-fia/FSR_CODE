The material is super comfortable, and the quality is phenomenal. It fits true to size with a slightly relaxed silhouette that is flattering on a variety of body types. This outfit is very versatile, especially because each piece can be paired with other items in your wardrobe. The affordable price tag is nice bonus. Highly recommend!",
Jeff,Very lounge outfit.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L7KGDIZA8P35/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CZLHM9S5,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 28, 2024",,,The shorts leg openings are huge and the bottom edge is curling up after washes. Ironing fixes it of course but who wants to iron lounge or set. Not a biggie though. Actually gives it a good look of being more comfy.  Material is thick. Not full on sweatshirt but like a thick tshirt. Daughter liked having the zipper so it didn't have to be full only around her neck.  The top length is crop like so raise your arms and midsection is open.  Otherwise she said she liked it.,
Magnolia,"Very comfortable,  great for casual wear at home",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RT1CTXAQUNAJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CZLHM9S5,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 10, 2024",,,"I got this shorts & top lounging set for my mother, and she confirmed she likes it after wearing it three times.  Even though my mother is normally a cold-natured person, I anticipated the coming summer would be an especially hot one and I wanted her to have something light and comfortable to wear.The fabric is soft and breathable.  The shorts fit well, and even though I thought the leg openings were a tad large, Mom said she liked them that way so they would not be binding when she moved around in her lift chair.  The top was a great fit, and the zippered neck section is cute.The clothing was washed twice and I have noted no beading, shrinkage, or loose threading.  The zipper feels solid and moves easily up and down on its track.  I can easily offer our recommendation for those looking for comfortable, casual summer wear.",2

Marsha,Mismatched sizing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GDAHSDOI343L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CZLHM9S5,"2.0 "," the United States "," August 14, 2024",,,"I'm very disappointed in the fit of this outfit.  The shorts fit perfectly, but the shirt is unwearable.  First, it ends above the shorts, which is not at all how it fit on the models in the listing.  The bottom of the shirt is also uncomfortably tight.  It's not in the least bit comfortable to wear, even when just lounging around the house where no one will see me.  I'm not sure if my shirt is a mislabeled size M or if the outfit is designed this way.  What I'm left with is a $36.99 pair of shorts, which is ridiculous.As for the shorts, they're very comfortable and can be worn as lounge wear or for every day use.  Both the shorts and the top have some sloppy stitching, but so far the shorts are holding up well.  At this point, I can't recommend this outfit, due to the mismatch in sizing between the pieces.",

It has a classy look to it.  The fabric is a thick knit so you don't have to worry about it being see-thru, but not so thick that it will feel heavy or hot.  I ordered my usual size and found it was a little snug.  I'd suggest if you are on the border between sizes, to go up a size.  I wish the maker had used a black cord on the shorts instead of a utility type beige tie but I'll just hide the ties by tucking in the ends.  In the Fall or for work, the top will go nice with black pants. Recommended.",

I like the set, but it seems as if the shorts and shirt are two different colors in the light (see pictures). Other than that, it's super comfy. I would definitely wear this to run errands, or walk the dog. It says sweat suit, but the material is light enough to wear on a warm day. The shirt hits right above the hips, and the shorts were long enough to keep your rear covered, both with a slightly loose fit. I'm 5'8, wear a US size 14/16, got the set in a size Large. Worth the money, I would recommend.",2

Material is lightweight without being too thin. Slight color difference in top and bottom, but not very noticeable. Not a big fan of the seams halfway down the sleeves. It feels a bit unfinished instead of fashionable detailing. Also wish the ties on the top’s zipper matched the ties on the shorts. One is black and thin, while  the other is thick and beige. Small detail, but I think it would make the set look more cohesive.",

I can’t imagine wearing pjs for an entire week, much less 6! This outfit is the perfect solution. I can wear it and be as comfortable as if I were wearing pjs, but look put together. It’s a  great athleisure set. It’s very versatile. Throw on some white court shoes and it’s a great weekend shopping outfit it would also make an excellent travel outfit. One thing that I like about this particular set that others seem to lack is that it has sleeves. It seems like most sets are sleeveless or long-sleeves. Very few have regular sleeves. The fabric is soft and comfortable and it fits true to size.",

The fabric is thick, soft, breathable, and feels more like cotton rather than stretchy/elastic polyester, the gray color is excellent for casual style, and the shirt's zipper and shorts' elastic band+drawstring all high quality and easy to use.  In fact the shirt's black zipper and the shorts' white drawstring with the black end tips/caps immediately enhance the appearance and make the set less dull and more stylish.  Both the shirt and shorts have two side pockets, a big plus.  The ruffle(s) right below the shorts' waist band is really cute, definitely adds more style to them.  I ordered L, the shirt is slightly loose but the shorts fits well.  It's a great value.",

It is a perfect fit and works really well for my curvy shape, it compliments the curves which doesn't always happen well, things tend be either baggy or too tight, this found the perfect balance. They also got the sizing right between the top and the bottom. Buying a top and bottom set I feel like is usually hit or miss, as one piece is usually way bigger/smaller than the other piece. This really nice and glad I took the gamble.",
Grammar Snob,Summer perfection!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KQXH11HSL51P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CZLHM9S5,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 10, 2024",,,"I have recently gotten into matching two-piece sets as a way to elevate my work-from-home wardrobe, but most of mine are too thick for summer. Even the short-sleeve/short combos seem to be sweatshirt material, and I knew I'd need something else for warmer weather.  This is perfect! It has the style and vibe of the cute sweatshirt sets except the fabric is exactly like t-shirt material—super lightweight and soft. I was worried it'd be that really cheap, scratchy material but it's not.  I am usually a medium (5'6"" 135-140) but I sized up because I'm thicker in the waist and wanted it to be comfy, and I'm glad I did. It's baggy, but I don't mind. If you aren't built like SpongeBob SquarePants like I am, you'll be fine in your regular size.  I love the little details, like the stitching on the shoulders and especially the cute tiny ruffle on the waistband. It's enough to elevate the set without making it feel too fussy. Plus, the shorts have TWO sets of pockets (sides and back) and the pockets are all deep enough for a phone. WOOHOOO!!!",
