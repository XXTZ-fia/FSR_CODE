It has 2 good sized pockets (both are big enough to hold my phone), plus little shorts underneath that keep it securely in place. I’ll probably never wear a skirt without built-in shorts ever again!  I’ve rarely gotten so many compliments on my outfits. I liked it so much that I had to get it in red as well! I only wish they had more colors and patterns.",

Calypso18,Fits amazingly and NO UNDERWEAR LINES!!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXTFW5XS9PYWL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CR31JPSG,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 24, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Red,Verified Purchase,"I have tried many of these types of “skorts” even though a skort in the 90s was when it looked like a skirt in the front and actual shorts in the back.  This one is lovely and the pockets and overall fit are really nice. My biggest concern with this type of fabric, “athletic wear” material—is always underwear lines because yes sometimes women wear regular underwear!  It did NOT show lines, and the color and fit was overall so awesome and I felt sexy in it!! I am more of a make an effort to look decent (not pajama pants and slippers) to go out even to run errands, and this skirt is a perfect and ideal skirt.  COVID screwed the lack of concern and effort people put in themselves when out in public and it’s saddening and disturbing. This skirt adds femininity, style and sexiness and I really love it. More colors to purchase!  In reference to sizing, this skirt is fairly accurate, but, again the body is so unique that “true to size” does not always apply. I am a Manager at a clothing store, so I fully speak from experience, so read what others say. Also, the height and weight reviews do help.  If you are unsure, measuring yourself and following the size guide definitely helps me in choosing sizes. For me it fit well (I don’t always fit the true to size statements either), so I hope this can help some of you lovely gals!  Have a great summer !",

By the way, I don't play tennis, but just love this as a cute basic item to throw on and go! Great value to add to your wardrobe!  As for sizing, for me personally I'm about half and half with whether I can go with a M or L for bottoms. I rounded down to a M for this because I'm on a weight loss journey now anyway.. I was right because a M fits! It will only fit better as I continue to shape up! 5'4"" 185lbs currently.",3

The red shade is exactly as shown, vibrant and eye-catching. What's great is that the skirt comes with built-in shorts and pockets. It fits me like a shirt mini skirt, which is perfect. However, due to my big butt, it turned out to be a bit shorter than I expected, about 3 inches past my butt. It's definitely on the shorter side! The material feels thick and has that typical gold skirt texture. Just a heads up, the panty line is visible, so it's best to wear a thong with it. Overall, it's definitely on the sexy side. I ordered a small size and it was true to size. It hugs my stomach in all the right ways. This skirt is perfect if you want to look cute and slightly sexy on the golf course or for a casual outing.",

This is stretch fabric that breathes and is comfortable very much like typical swim suit as far as the fabric goes. So she does not have high expectations of more than one season's wear out of this garment based on the fabric type, we'll see and update the review to let you know. We baby these kind of garments, washing on cool/gentle and always hang dry. She gives it a thumbs up for resort wear & golf and thanks to the skort styling also for playing pickleball. Enjoy!",

I loved the red enough to risk it and am happy to report that it does, in fact, have built-in shorts.  If your tall, this is going to be a mini on you, but I personally like where it hits. For reference, I'm 5'3"", 135 lbs, 27"" waist, 39"" hips and the medium fit well. I took off one star because the fabric doesn't provide ANY compression and is thin enough you can see a panty line, even wearing VS no-show panties. If these came in a heavier compression fabric, I'd buy every color at twice the price.",2
