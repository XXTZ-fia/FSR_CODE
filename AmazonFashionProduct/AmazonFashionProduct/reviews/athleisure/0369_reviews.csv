Kris,Great for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HAD7PF0MLQI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKXCQ5V,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"For inexpensive workout leggings, these are really nice. The fit is great - bought my usual size and it fit perfectly. From the pictures, I was concerned that they were going to hit above the ankles, when I was looking for full length. They are full length, with a 27” inseam. The fabric is full coverage and very stretchy but not too heavy. I think they’ll be great for yoga, strength training, and cardio. I’ll definitely be ordering more.",

I’m a size 10, 148 lbs. The size medium fit firm around the waist area, but not uncomfortable. It just keeps everything smooth and sucks you in around the waist area, without being oppressively tight or creating a muffin top. I think the leggings are great, but I had to take off one star because the material is sheer. I wore white underwear underneath with a very light design, and you could clearly see my underwear through the legging. And I don’t have a big posterior, so it’s not due to excessive stretching of the fabric. I only ordered the pink color, so I can’t speak to darker colors sheerness level. But the hot pink is a fabulous color! And I will still wear it with a tunic length top or longer oversized sweatshirt or sweater.",11

You may as well wear your underwear on the outside, that’s how well you can see it. The inconsistent compression serves to create rolls where you don’t even have them, while not actually doing the job of compressing, overall. The seam across the butt is too low and gives early 2000’s low-rise flat butt look. They’re too big for me, others say they’re too small or short, so suffice to say sizing is inconsistent.",

It's awkward because they hit right in the middle of a baby-induced spare tire which of course makes me extremely self-conscious as well as uncomfortable physically in them. I thought in the pictures it went up to most of the women's naval, but I wasn't expecting it to be this high up on me.  The fabric is thick at least in the black ones and not see through from what I can tell so far. If it fits you right, it's probably okay. The fit is snug in the legs not loose like some of the other reviews said but then I do have larger legs.  I can't see wearing these though since they come up to an uncomfortable spot. I'm 5'7 and presumably a shorter torso then. Keep this in mind when ordering.",

SalaManders,6x review consistent with Torrid,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4TNM2BBS08XN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKXCQ5V,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 15, 2021",Size: 6XColor: Bright Pink,Verified Purchase,"So many of my favorites from Amazon Essentials are going out of stock gradually I was shocked to see these newbies, and pleased!  Ordered a few pair but kept only one because the pink was too good to pass up.  The good: I'm a solid 6x/30 at Torrid, bottom heavy with big booty, hips and tummy, smaller waist.  These fit great.  At 5'4"" they come to my ankle.  Rise is perfect even with my massive curves.  One pair sent to me was accidentally a 5x; if I thought I could size down I found out the hard way that is NOT true.  The waist was enough smaller that it would have popped stitches to pull them over my booty.  Two gripes: 1) These are slippery like an athletic legging whereas I wish they had a softer feel and better rebound.  Perhaps more cotton content or maybe microfiber like my favorite tights.  2) For my build, the calves and ankles were too big but not tremendously so.  Again, with more rebound in the fabric that part could have been cut smaller and really fit to the leg.  All things considered, and for how hard it is to find decent clothes this size, kudos Amazon and I recommend.  I do not recommend wearing them in summer, they get pretty slimy.  :)",31

I love these. They are very similar to what I liked from old navy. These seem to have a thicker waistband for more compression which I like. The only negative for these is the fact that there’s no pocket on the side but other than that they’re great.,
