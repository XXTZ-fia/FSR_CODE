I was shocked. Great value for how much I love them, and I am DEFINITELY going to order more---  great number in color selection. I never wrIte reviews because I don't have time, but this calls for a standing ovation!  Suuuuuper soft, super professional looking for work (so versatile, because they aren't like regular yoga pants), fantastically fitting, very forgiving in terms of stretchiness, cut in perfect proportions, and high quality workmanship (I'm a seamstress). The fabric is some kinda WOW!  Lucky the girl who finds this product.",12

The tailored fit and ankle-length cut are super flattering, and the fabric is lightweight yet durable. I also appreciate the functional pockets, which are both practical and stylish. They’re easy to care for and look just as good after multiple washes.  If you’re looking for versatile pants that combine performance with style, these are a must-have.

Bentle89,Wow these are so comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR8DGGSOC8PXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C774XCNC,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 25, 2023",Size: X-SmallColor: True Navy,Verified Purchase,"Love these pants! I got a navy pair just for golfing in cooler weather after learning they were a dupe for a notorious -lemon brand. Loved them. When I learned that for my new job black golf style pants are recommended I immediately ordered two pairs in black. I got XXS and XS to see which I liked better but actually kept both. Both fit just fine. The XS has a *slightly* higher rise and are a tiny bit longer. There may be a smidge more room in the hips. I thought I would prefer one size over the other but now would like to order a third pair to help keep the weekly laundry down and can’t decide if I want another XXS or another XS. I am 5’3” about 115. I normally wear 0/00 in pants. I have not tried the real version of these copycat pants but find them comfortable, lightweight, stretchy, the waist band isn’t too thick, doesn’t cut in, also isn’t too tight relative to the fit of the rest of the pant. They seem to be a “normal rise” they don’t ride up. The pockets are nice and big but not lumpy. The pants dry fast if splashed and don’t seem to hold on to dirt or dust or pet hair. The drawstring lays flat and has little metal bits on the ends that haven’t fallen off yet in the dryer despite washing every other day. They’ve survived the dryer. They aren’t too wrinkly if you hang dry. They don’t seem to snag easily. They don’t seem to show any wear at all yet even though I’ve not been gentle when wearing or washing. Highly recommend. If I got the real pants for twice the price I’d be worried about ruining them at work. I don’t think these pants are necessarily cheap in price but neither is the quality.",24

Judy L.,Perfect Pants!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38JGMDE0EII5L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C774XCNC,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 7, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Ink Gray,Verified Purchase,"I am 5'6"" about 200 lbs (+/-) and I ordered XXL in a teal blue, light blue and a color called Melanite. (those are still coming) The length of the pants go just over my ankles and the pockets do gap a little, but thats because I carry a lot of my weight in my middle. I have bought many many styles of these type of pants and I believe I have found the perfect ones. They fit very nice (sorry I do not do photos), I would say true to size. The legs are slim and in the seat area fit nicely, not too snug. The stretch band at the waist is a nice width and comfortable, not tight. There is a draw string, not sure why, because the elastic waist is more than enough to keep the pants up. The material is a lovely soft polyamide, that feels like modal fabric. The pants look dressy enough to be paired nicely with an upscale top, for work, or dress down for casual outings. I have, as of yet, not laundered, so I will have to see how they hold up afterwards. For now I'm very excited to have found these pants!",3

These pants aren’t super baggy on me but I wish they were slightly a little tighter around my legs. The length is okay. The pants go down to my ankles. I think I’m going to have to hem them a few inches so I can get the 7/8 pant look.  Overall the pants are great. I just feel like they fit more like an xs than a xxs.,

The sizing is accurate and fits well around the waist, but the length is long and may not suit petite individuals. It sits higher than the waist when worn. It’s good for general use, especially due to its flexibility, like leggings. However, some colors and sizes may have limited availability and longer delivery times. Be cautious, as it might shrink in the wash; use laundry nets and hang dry if possible.  The brand should consider offering PETITE sizes, as there are many customers who would benefit from them.

These pants are incredibly comfortable and breathable. The outside has a silkier texture and the black color is not see through. I am in Michigan and these are great for the 40-50 degree mornings and 70-80 degrees afternoons. I was shocked at the quality of the pants because I expected what you would normally get when it comes to active wear (which for me has usually been a swing and a miss), but these exceeded my expectations! Because I am so short, these are not ankle pants on me and I have about 2 inches of extra material at the bottom. This isn't a deal breaker for me because they look cute rolled up.
