Rachel,"Nice quality, just wasn't into the style",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C8VBSSGNG5FI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07JFYNYBG,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Fuchsia,Verified Purchase,"Granted, this is a nice shirt. The fabric is soft and comfortable, and the cut is flattering. However, I can personally vouch that it's not a great yoga shirt, as opposed to what the product description states--it was constantly falling down into my face whenever I did a downward dog in yoga class. And for someone who is a little self-conscious about their belly, this was less than ideal.  The other little gripe I had is that the sleeves are snug and trap in heat, while the back is very open and breezy. So it's hard to find that perfect temperature range where this shirt is comfortable to wear.  The shirt did fit me well, but I ended up giving it away, because of the reasons I've mentioned, after owning it for a few months. (For reference, I bought a size large, I'm 5'8'', my weight is 170 lbs., and my bust/waist/hip measurements are 38"", 33"", and 43"", respectively.)",

It falls open in the back, but not all of the time--just enough to see a peek of a sports bra. The stretch is really good, but not bordering on the ""lycra"" feel of things. I  just love it.

I mostly bought it to show off a new cute sports bra :) After I put it on, I thought of buying more colors bc truly it is so comfy and flattering, but the shoulder seam is half way down my bicep. You have to look really hard in the product images. It looks like it was supposed to be a short sleeve shirt and they sewed on sleeves as an after thought. However, it is fitted in the arms, soft, breezy but not baggy, and rests nicely on the hips so I am keeping it.",5
