Kristine Potter,I Had To LOL,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5YA3UFAARXGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCZX1BLR,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 9, 2023",Special Size: Regular SizeSize: LargeColor: Set 1,Verified Purchase,"It's always interesting when I try to base my purchase decisions by balancing what I Want with Buyer Reviews and Question/Answers. First, I was looking for comfortable shirts. Then I was looking for fit. Then I was looking for thickness. In addition, I was looking specifically for inexpensive, quality shirts that would fit and be comfortable enough for me to SLEEP in.  Sheerness first because that's what made me laugh. The first shirt I held up (lavender from what's currently listed as Set 1) was so sheer that I could see my entire living room through it. However, let me qualify my lol by stating that I was holding it up to a light because I was looking for cosmetic blemishes (I didn't find blemishes in any of the 5 shirts). That said, if you're going to be out and about during bright daylight, it will be somewhat see through. In addition if it fits you tightly around the bust or middle, it will be see through indoors as well. My concerns about sheerness had mostly to do with the fact that I'd be braless in them.  The fit is always hit or miss. I have to look through a ton of Reviews and Question/Answers before I decide whether to buy a S, M, or L. There were enough comments to convince me I'd be safest ordering 1 size up for comfort. Even if the shirt turned out to be a bit large on me, that probably would be okay because it wasn't something I'd be wearing out of the house. As long as I can keep the clothing item on my body, loose is most comfortable around the house for me. If I was going to wear these out, I'd order a medium (I'm 5'3"" 135lbs mostly pear shaped). I'm not large-breasted, so I probably wouldn't stretch out the shirt enough for my bra to show through it...on a cloudy day.  Regarding comfort: I was looking for lightweight, and soft. Some might automatically go for a cotton blend, but I have other shirts of this blend (that are NOT see through), and I find them extremely comfortable to wear and simole to care for. They also don't wrinkle. These met my criteria in this category.  For the price point when I bought them, it think the overall quality looks pretty good. There weren't loose threads on any of the seams or cuffs. In my experience, whether that holds up through laundering will have mostly to do with the quality of thread the manufacturer uses. I keep a simple sewing machine in my utility room, so I can do quick zigzags to help with further unraveling. For this price, I expect one or more of them will end up beneath the needle at some point; although, the thin fabric could deteriorate first.  I'm keeping them for the reasons I bought them, but I won't be wearing them without a bra if family or friends stop by for a quick visit. One turn sideways from a lamp, and the transparent silhouette of the girls would make my adult sons uncomfortable. I have cotton blends that will work better for those occasions. I do expect they will be very comfortable to sleep in. If not, I'll be back.",167
Cheryl E Fitzgerald,Impressed these shirts actually keep you cooler (and in the heat & humidity of Florida!),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDHT9TGQUNJ49/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCZX1BLR,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 11, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"I do like these Real Essentials Dry Fit Women's shirts; they’re not amazing or anything, but for what they are and for the price, they’re nice. They’re comfortable, and they really are cool! I live in Florida, and I have to be outside several times a day to tend to my piggy. I have been delightfully surprised how much cooler these are than any of my regular shirts. And I got all black, by the way.  The material is kind of on the thin side and doesn’t have the full opacity of a cotton tshirt. But it’s not sheer or see through; let’s say, it’s opacity is about 90% or something like that. So if you need that full opacity, the black (and maybe other darks?) might be okay; or you might want to just pass on these. (Holding fabric up to the light isn’t at all an accurate test of how it looks being worn, unless you plan on wearing a string of xmas lights underneath…)  I’ve been wearing these shirts basically everyday for 5 1/2 months now, and their durability thus far is good. I have not had any issues with seams; nor with holes, snags, or runs. I use a front-loader, but if you use a top-loading washing machine, I suggest either washing on the gentle/delicate cycle, or put them in delicates/lingerie bags, just to be on the safe side, because agitators in top-loaders can be rough on clothes.  Regarding sizing, I think this will depend on how you want the shirt to fit. Since so many reviewers said they run small, I first got the large, and it was larger than I was expecting based on the reviews. So I then got the medium, and I have to admit I was surprised it was only a little smaller than the large. The length is fairly similar; the shoulders and body of the medium are narrower by maybe a little less than an inch on each side (laying flat). At some point in the future I will probably get the small too.  If you want it to be a little fitted while still being a little loose, then I suggest first just going with your normal size. If you want it to be more loose than fitted, go one size up. If you want it to be more like a classic tshirt fit but without the extra wide shoulders of regular “unisex” tshirts that are really just made for men’s bodies, then go two sizes up.  So… is it flattering? Honestly, if this is something you care about, I think this is one of those types of things where you just have to get it and try it on and see how it looks on you. Because on some bodies, it will look nice; but for some people’s bodies, it just won’t work well for them (according to their preferences).  Last point: I’m not sure, but they might have bled in the wash (at least the first time anyway), and that was with cold water. If you get dark colors, it’s probably a good idea to take precaution just in case. The material does dry fairly quickly, and it is polyester after all, so dry on low heat, or just hang if you prefer.",127

Got these for my wife and she just absolutely loves them. I had bought her some of these shirts in the past and decided to get some more of different colors. They’re soft and stretchable and don’t shrink when washed. When ordering, it’s probably a good idea to order a size up. The only complaint I have about them is, when they arrived, the white shirt had a big stain in the front and a small stain in the back. My wife treated the stains and washed the shirts, but even afterward the stains were still slightly visible. All the other shirts we ordered never had stains, just this last order, unfortunately it had to be the white shirt. Other than that, these shirts are a good buy for the money.

I was surprised that these ones fit him better than the ones for men that I had just ordered for him.  They look more ‘hip’ on him, with a shorter sleeve and a flared bottom that helps to hide his slight paunch!  The color blocking inserts in the side also help with slimming.  Also, he says: The material is cool when it’s hot and warm when it’s cold outside.  Plus, he loves the fact that his underarms never seem to smell in theses shirts!So, if your guy is looking for something with a little better fit and style, that you can’t get in a ‘regular guy tee,’ order him a set if these!

I picked size XXL  based on size chart (bust) and they are definitely  a  full size larger than my other shirts. Wish I had sized down. They are quite boxy and long on me. (5'4"")  Still, a great deal and I'll use them for workout sessions and yard work.",4
