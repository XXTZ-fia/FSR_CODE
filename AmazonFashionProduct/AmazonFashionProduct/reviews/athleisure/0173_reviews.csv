Star Sweeper,Soft and Breathable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DGSFLHGFC5W6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCMJDND,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Fit Type: RegularSize: MediumColor: Everpine,,"I've been wearing these leggings to do yoga in a warm room. What I like about them is how breathable they are. I usually wear shorts when doing hot yoga, but I can get away with them because they don't lock heat in, even when wet with sweat.  The second thing I like is that although they are made of spandex-like materials, they're soft and matte. To be honest, I think spandex is a fantastic workout material, but I don't wear it because it's often thin, shiny, and has a synthetic feel. These have all the breathability and stretchability of spandex but they feel more like softert fabrics.  Overall, I would definitely purchase these in other colors.",

I had to buy 3 more pair. They are so comfortable and I don't experience them rolling at all. I wish it had pockets, but It still my favorite leggings. It's not see-through at all. These are great for running, workout at gym, or casual wear. Highly recommend!",

I really like the yoked seaming in the back, it is very flattering for a curvy behind. The pink color is very vibrant without being neon which is a hard balance to strike. I think that the Yitty brand overall definitely hits the mark and I will be buying more pieces in the near future.",
Saswensfam,Leggings,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ8L7DIX4FZE8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCMJDND,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 3, 2024",Fit Type: RegularSize: SmallColor: Everpine,,I got these for a Halloween costume but they arrived too late unfortunately. I am glad I ordered them though. They are comfortable and great for at home or at the gym. They’re flattering and feel like food quality because you can’t see your under pants when you bend down.,
TAKILIGI,Highly recommended..,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26N2PS0OPO2WP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCMJDND,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 29, 2024",Fit Type: RegularSize: SmallColor: Beach Party,,"I recently purchased the YITTY Active UltraLuxe High-Waist No-Pocket Legging, and I'm absolutely thrilled with their performance, comfort, and style. These leggings are made from a buttery-soft fabric that offers 4-way stretch, moisture-wicking, and light to medium compression, making them perfect for workouts and casual wear.  The high-waist design provides gentle tummy control and creates a flattering silhouette. The absence of front seams ensures a smooth and sleek look, preventing any unwanted lines or camel toe. I appreciate the UPF 50+ protection, making them suitable for outdoor activities as well.  The leggings are available in sizes up to 6X, promoting inclusivity and catering to various body shapes. The versatile design and excellent quality make them a must-have in any activewear collection. Overall, I highly recommend the YITTY Active UltraLuxe High-Waist No-Pocket Legging for anyone seeking comfortable, stylish, and performance-driven leggings.",
Liz,So Comfy and Cute!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YS9DQCLYTLV5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCMJDND,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 22, 2024",Fit Type: RegularSize: LargeColor: Iconic Black,,These leggings are absolutely perfect. The texture of them is soft and buttery and they maintain that feel even after they've been laundered multiple times. They are thick enough that they're not at all see through and while they might smooth they don't constrict and they're not uncomfortable. They're so comfortable you could live in them. They're a great find and added into our legging rotation.,
Carrie Collins,So comfortable and flattering!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBQO1JVWTX28K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCMJDND,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 18, 2024",Fit Type: RegularSize: MediumColor: Everpine,Verified Purchase,"From the moment I put them on, I was impressed by how soft and comfortable the fabric feels. The compression is just enough to give my booty life again without squeezing it flat and the high-waist smooths and shapes my hips/stomach.",
Joe and Jane User,Comfortable and stretchy leggings by Yitty/Fabletics with a front seam and crossover waistband,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RCYZLRZV7VPE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCMJDND,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Fit Type: RegularSize: MediumColor: Iconic Black,,"The black cross-waisted size medium leggings by Yitty/Fabletics is made in Jordan. The tag in the waistband of the leggings states the fabric is 82% polyester and 18% spandex. I did not find any issue with the fabric or stitching out of the bag. The material has a soft, smooth feel. The material is very stretchy. The waistband is a crossover band, and does a good job of staying in place. The waistband did slowly roll down on me, but only after several minutes of medium impact aerobics and sit ups. These are very comfortable for all day wear. The material is thick enough to not show anything underneath, but thin enough to be worn in in warm weather. These are very good leggings. The crossover waistband was not clearly identified in the item description and photos. 4 stars",
Regina,Definitely stretchy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3A6JUKW1XHGD0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCMJDND,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 13, 2024",Fit Type: RegularSize: MediumColor: Everpine,,"These leggings are pretty nice.  They feel nice and soft.  Theres also a lot of stretch to these leggings.  I did find that the waist band is pretty loose.  So if you're looking for the waist band to suck you in, these are not the leggings for you.  But if you're looking for leggins that are super soft and comfy... get these.",
Ginger,Stretchy and buttery soft,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39GAHFNK5G1OF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCMJDND,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 12, 2024",Fit Type: RegularSize: MediumColor: Everpine,,"These high waisted leggings are exactly that. I am 5’ and the crossover waist comes up to the base of my ribs. The material is very soft and stretchy. Crossover waists can sometimes enhance any midsection weight, but this one doesn’t because it comes up so high. The only issue with these is that they tok a long time to ship, but other than that the quality and comfort for the price is worth it.",
AD,Ultraluxe indeed,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUHBGKAMXFUBY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCMJDND,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 10, 2024",Fit Type: RegularSize: MediumColor: Iconic Black,,"The material on these is amazing. Buttery soft, stretchy, yet not thin or transparent. They hide all the stuff you typically want to hide, I immediately felt comfortable putting these on. Ordered a medium, 5’8”, 165ish, fit perfectly well. The hit right at my ankle as well, they’re very high waisted, exactly what I like. The crossover band makes my waist looks nice, but I did notice the material to be slightly bulky (very slightly) in that area. Overall I found these to be very comfortable, would absolutely order again.",
Ashley,Good,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30ULXMJE6CXEX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCMJDND,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 9, 2024",Fit Type: RegularSize: SmallColor: Burgundy,,"I was excited to get these. The color is beautiful, and just like the stock photos. The only thing I didn’t like is that the ankle area was large. I have very skinny calves so that may be why. I would recommend sizing down one size. They are otherwise very comfortable. The fabric is soft. The waist fits great as well.",
toolgirl40,Runs small; gorgeous green color; sent wrong item,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OQ96PVEX6XM8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCMJDND,"1.0 "," the United States "," November 9, 2024",Fit Type: RegularSize: SmallColor: Everpine,,"I wanted to try these but they sent the cross-front (low) rather than the high-waisted version I ordered. They also must have sent a short pair rather than regular because I take a 27"" inseam and these aren't even capris on me. I also am a S by this size chart (27"" waist) and they run super small through the legs. I am muscular, but my other leggings from about 9 different brands all fit fine. The everpine is absolutely gorgeous, I'm very very disappointed they couldn't get me the right pair of leggings. Vine items aren't returnable, so I'm stuck getting rid of these.",

They have a lot of wide seams, which I don't love. I liked the waistband and it fit great. The legs though run a little small, so they fit too snug everywhere except the waist, and unfortunately I am not a curvaceous person, so the reason is not my voluptuous hourglass figure lol. The sizing is just off. If I'd size up, I believe the waist would be too big and loose. The legs fit so tight that the wide seams left impressions on my skin. Every single seam, the whole way up and down my legs.",
