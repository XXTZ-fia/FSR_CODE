Mrs. B.,Runs small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R126HFEQJAF3O1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYWL4W49,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 1, 2024",,,"Vine reviewer here giving you my honest hands-on review and inspection of the product you are considering.  I thought this looked kind of retro and thought I'd get it for 80s Day at school. It might have worked, I just wish it was brighter. However it is way too small. I wear a 10, I probably should have got an XL if I wanted a much baggier look. A large may (may) have been okay, but the idea of showing off my cellulite does not bode well with me.  The fabric is very thin polyester. However, if it's for working out, it won't breathe at all. The pants are tight on me and they show every little bump. This is not forgiving fabric. If you size up, maybe being looser will help. But wherever the fabric touches your skin, it will show detail: muffin tops, bra lines, and cellulite... every bit of it.  The track suit is well made but it's not high end clothing. It's overlocked throughout. No pockets. The ribbing on the sleeves, waistband, and ankles feels a little loose as it is not tightly ribbed. This may be a good thing; it allows for the leg to drop to the bottom of the ankle and not bunch up at the ankle and stay there (my kids call these sausage pants because of that). But it might stretch more as time goes by and get very loose.  I am going to either gift this to my elderly mother or youngest daughter. I think it's ironic, one will wear it because it looks like old lady clothes (my mother is in her 80s), the other because is trendy. But at least it will get worn, just not by me :)",

Jana T,Wish it was Softer & Better Fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ENP36P7RKX8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYWL4W49,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 10, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Khaki/Brown,,"The first thing to notice is the 96% Polyester, 4% Elastane which gives the top plenty of stretch but not to where it looks slouchy. Will work for this coming winter, keeping me warm on those cold days. I wouldn't wear it for spring or summer. The waist band on the shirt has a nice ribbing to it and not binding. The cuffs on the sleeves have plenty of stretch to it. The waist band on the pants have elastic & a drawstring. The elastic isn't overly tight just enough to hold them up and remain comfortable. But the pants didn't fit nearly as well as the top. It was more snug and I don't have much of a bum or hips. They felt like it was a size smaller compared to the top. The length on the pants was fine. I will wear them at home but doubt I that I'll wear them in public.",
