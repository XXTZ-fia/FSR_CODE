Andralee,Super comfortable and flattering,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34450DD3UCOFX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9C26TSG,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2024",,Verified Purchase,I’m a plus size and was hesitant to order without trying on but I went with the size I normally wear and it fit perfectly! So soft!  Just the right amount of stretch (not too boxy) and looks great for working out or a casual shopping trip. It’s average warmth. It is a winner in my opinion!  I am planning on ordering in other colors too.,
RGG,"Great length, comfy and doesn't shrink.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPVDN960Z8PMZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9C26TSG,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2024",,Verified Purchase,I went back and bought one in blue too. It's not super heavyweight (great for Arizona winters - or fall/spring weather for colder climates) and the length is perfect - covering most of my rear end without looking too long. I've washed a few times and it doesn't shrink at all. Really like the RBX line of clothing - I've purchased 6-7 items of clothing from them and they all hold up great and are true to size.,
E-malljunkie,Nice oversize warmth,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ICUSQ0PHRCIN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9C26TSG,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 22, 2024",Color: Coronet BlueSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,Love the oversize silhouette. Long enough to cover your hips. Loose enough to wear over a t shirt. Nice color. Hoodie gives some interest around your neck.,
Judie,RBX hoodie,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14J9H8X147XBN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9C26TSG,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 12, 2024",Color: Light PurpleSize: Medium,,A nice well made hoodie from RBX.  I normally wear a med or large.  I bought the medium and it fit perfectly.  I took off 1 star because the hoodie adjustment straps caused the collar to lay oddly.  I cut the straps out and problem solved.,2
W,A winner!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SERGYEY0SXRV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9C26TSG,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 3, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Love this sweatshirt! RBX pretty consistently knocks it out of the park with their plus-sized athletic wear. This sweatshirt is long enough to wear with leggings and is so soft. It is true to size, so if you want a baggy, oversized look I would maybe suggest sizing up. But I ordered my true size and it fits perfectly, with no pulling or tightness. It’s great quality and I see myself wearing it all winter.",4
JetzNY,Comfy And Practical,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFV0IHA863BNV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9C26TSG,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 19, 2024",Color: Coronet BlueSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,Medium was perfect Size,
Katie G,"Comfortable to wear, nice fit",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EPXUP4T3O9GX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9C26TSG,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,,"I like everything about this shirt. It fits me well and feels great on. It is a great length, although I don’t really think it can be considered a tunic length shirt. The front pocket is large and roomy, but I didn’t feel like anything was going to fall out when I put stuff in it. The hood is large enough to cover my head. The shirt washed up nicely in the washer and dryer. There were a few long threads coming loose on the shirt, but I don’t think it’s falling apart or anything.",
tinytracer,Oversized and comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAOWI5NEBZNO9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9C26TSG,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 24, 2024",Color: Light PurpleSize: X-Small,,"I ordered this cute purple hoodie in XS and found out to be very comfy and soft. I'm 4'11"" and 86lb so it ended up being a little oversized, but I didn't mind it. I like a good oversized hoodie. It washed well. I think the price point is a little high but overall I'm satisfied with the look and comfort.",
AmazonCustomer,Soft and comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR1DR7EZGH3P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9C26TSG,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 6, 2024",,,"Nice relaxed fit without being grossly oversized. The fit and the material gave me no sensory issues. Tag in the neck removed easily and left no pokey bits behind. I like the neck of this. It can be a v neck or you can tie it for more modesty. Fabric is thin. Can’t really put anything in the front pocket because the fabric can’t support it. Even though the fabric is thin I felt comfortable in it and did not feel self conscious about it showing body flaws. Sleeves are long enough to pull down to my fingertips or will just hang at the wrist, and also stayed pushed up when pushed up over my forearms.",2
Diana Z,Soft and comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR7XOB9DW4FUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9C26TSG,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 25, 2024",,,I ordered the RBX Active women's hoodie in a 2XL. I found it to be very soft and comfortable to wear. It is oversized and measures approximately 27 inch under arm to under arm and about 30 inches long from top of shoulder to bottom hem. It is slightly longer in the back and stylish with 2 side vents. The V-neck is lower than some other hoodies and doesn't choke you. It is a lightweight and stretchy fabric that you can wear for any casual occasion.,
Amazon Customer,Quality brand,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PW8ESMBZOLHQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9C26TSG,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 8, 2024",Color: Coronet BlueSize: Large,,"Wife loved this hoodie. Obviously name brand quality, soft and comfortable. Definitely not to heavy, probably perfect for fall and as layer in winter. The fit may be slightly big",
Somewhere on Earth,Cozy comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2P0S1RLSYUOOJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9C26TSG,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 28, 2024",Color: Light PurpleSize: Small,,"Incredibly soft, warm and cozy. Feels like fleece but so much more lightweight. The fit is comfortably loose yet has a nice look and doesn’t appear as oversized nor tacky. I work with a workout bra underneath and yoga pants and received so many compliments. The sweater is long, so when worn with shorts, it likely will cover the hem of shorts, giving a nothing underneath look if that’s your preference. (Not mine!) Washes easily and the quality is fantastic I love this sweater and will wear it frequently in addition to actually buying more in other colors available. Price is comparable to other quality fitness workout brands.",
