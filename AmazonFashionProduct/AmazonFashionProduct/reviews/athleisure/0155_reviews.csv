T. Markable,"It's a cute athletic skirt/skort, true to size.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJBLLKFDQ117M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJDPD86H,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 7, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Deep Navy,,"I am a 48 year old and used to sizes as they were from the 1990s through the 2010s. Are small, medium, and large still the same now, I'm not so sure as people here are getting larger, sizes might be aligning differently.  I ordered a medium. I am athletic, but not as much as I used to be. The jeans in my drawer are currently petite size 6 and my daughter's regular size 8 is just a little big for me. I always wear a size PM top.  The size M in this skirt fits me well. It's long enough on my petite frame to be suitable for my age range. It's short enough to still fit like an athletic skirt should. It hits me mid thigh. It's a little bit flippy, a cute nonfitted skirt style. The fabric is not too thin. The waistband is made of a double layer of the fabric so it lays flat while not slipping. It stays in place. The shorts underneath are very comfortable. There is a pocket on the left hip only.",
Michigan Mom,Great material and fits true to size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DQWP1BPMLSQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJDPD86H,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 1, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Deep Navy,,"The material is really nice and soft.

BAHAR KARADAG,Very good quality!

I find them very comfortable. This product has very good quality. The material is soft, the fit is great. It wraps up the waist line very nicely.  The length is perfect, it is not too short or long. It sits 4-5 inches above knees. It has a nice flare.  The short part is also very comfortable. It has a pocket on the side, great to place keys, phone etc. I wear size 8 or medium in US size. I weigh 133 pounds and I`m 5ft 2"", as a reference. Medium fits me very well. I chose red. It is a very vibrant red, gives me great energy.  Overall I`m very happy with this product, easily receives 5 stars from me.",
Anna,It is not my favorite skort,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VPLWY2RFGLT7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJDPD86H,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 30, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Deep Navy,,I ordered according to the size chart and it fits as expected. It is longer in the back which I am not a fan of- it makes it look unflattering on me. It is a decent quality skirt and washes well.,

Adam Shields,Stylish and Comfortable Tennis Skirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1L682UXPKMVY7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJDPD86H,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 16, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Deep Navy,,"This tennis skirt/skort is an economic addition to any activewear wardrobe. The high-waist design is both flattering and secure shaping tummies, and the built-in shorts provide great coverage and comfort during workouts or casual wear. The 4-way stretch material is soft, breathable, and moves with you, making it perfect for activities like tennis, running, or yoga.  The skirt has a sleek and stylish look that works well beyond just athletic settings—it’s great for an athleisure outfit too. The fit is true to size, and the fabric feels high-quality, holding up well after multiple washes.  I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the shorts could use a bit more grip at the hem to prevent them from riding up during more intense activities. Otherwise, it’s a great piece of activewear.",

I wear a lot of these and I was Super impressed with this one right out of the bag. It's got the most amazing buttery soft feel. There is one pocket on the left side which is adequate for a ball or your phone. So far the under shorts haven't been riding up. The length is a little bit longer than others, which doesn't make it really long but good to know for those looking for little more length. I would 100% order this again.",
L.A. Smith,Skirt is very flared.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D7LS8DAT771M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJDPD86H,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 16, 2024",Size: SmallColor: True White,,"This is a nice athletic skirt/skort, well made, & good quality fabric. However, the skirt is more flared out at the bottom than I'm used to wearing. Most of my skorts/skirts are more fitting at the hips. It runs TTS in the hips, but the waistband seems a little tight. For reference, I'm 5'9 120lbs 26 inch waist, I usually wear an XS-S. I got this in a small & it fits. I believe an XS would've been to tight in the waist. The only downside is that is doesn't have pockets anywhere (shorts or skirt). Price point is comparable to similar skorts. If you like the flared skirt, this would be a good option.",
Cathy Rockwell,Nice fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L32O5EJS9V63/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJDPD86H,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 11, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Deep Navy,,I ordered the small and it fits perfectly.

The fabric is substantial, not like the flyaway fabric used in some tennis skirts. I wish it had pockets in the shorts on both sides, as I am a leftie and that is crucial. I am 5'3"" and 145 lbs...I should have ordered a large as this is very tight on me. Lesson learned.",

This skort is nice! Great quality material and stitching! The four-way stretch makes it easy to slide on and off. Gorgeous burgundy color that looks exactly as advertised. I followed the sizing guide based on my measurements and it fits true to size. I love that it has a hidden pocket underneath the skirt on the shorts. I ordered a large and it fits well and feels comfortable to wear. I love the flare! It compliments my figure well. It has a light compression. The skort is more than activewear, you can wear it casually as well! Great price point for such a quality piece!",

However, my main issue is the legs of the shorts, they don’t have any of the silicone at the end of them to help keep them in place on your legs, and they are super short. This means they ride up super easy, so if you are super active and move around a lot, and have chunkier thighs, you may get some chafing.",
