It is beyond comfortable. It is true to size, soft, stretchy, thick but not heavy. It doesn’t feel like I am wearing a shirt. Shipping and packaging was quick and nice! I am anxiously waiting for my next paycheck to buy more of them! I highly recommend these.",
Lauren Sanchez,Oversized & comfortable!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8PKC914S2NH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BPYFLBTC,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Armygreen,Verified Purchase,"After having my 2nd child, my body hasn't bounced back like it once did so while planning to go back to the gym I realized none of my previous clothes fit.  I came across this brand and am so highly pleased. This shirt comes in multiple colors, it's oversized as described and is breathable. Good quality material. True to size! If you want the shirt more oversized I would size up.  The shirt is not wrinkle resistant as you can see in the picture, is stretchy, and in my opinion flattering. Run to go buy! You won't be disappointed.  Will be buying more colors.",2
Kat Alyst,Stylish Black T-Shirt - Almost Perfect with a Touch of Comfort,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR9YFXKNIWGJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BPYFLBTC,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 3, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I recently purchased a black T-shirt, and overall, it has proven to be a great addition to my wardrobe. While it didn't quite meet my expectations in terms of softness and length, I still find it to be a stylish and versatile piece. Here's why I believe this black T-shirt deserves a solid four-star rating.  First and foremost, the style and appearance of this black T-shirt are excellent. The color is rich and deep, giving it a sleek and timeless look. The design is simple and versatile, making it suitable for various occasions and outfit combinations. It has become a go-to option in my wardrobe for both casual and slightly dressier ensembles.  The quality of the T-shirt is commendable. The fabric is sturdy and holds up well through repeated wears and washes. The stitching and construction are solid, ensuring that the T-shirt retains its shape and durability over time. This aspect is crucial for me as I value long-lasting clothing investments.  While the T-shirt falls short in terms of softness, it is still comfortable to wear. The fabric has a slight roughness to it, which may not be as luxurious as I had hoped. However, it doesn't cause any discomfort or irritation against the skin. With each wear, it becomes more comfortable as it molds to the body.  One aspect that didn't fully meet my expectations is the length of the T-shirt. I prefer my shirts to be on the longer side, and this one falls a bit shorter than I anticipated. While it still covers the essentials, I would have preferred a longer length for added versatility and styling options. However, this may vary depending on personal preferences and body proportions.  Despite these minor shortcomings, I still find this black T-shirt to be a valuable addition to my wardrobe. Its style, quality, and overall comfort make it a reliable choice for various occasions. I appreciate its versatility and the ease with which it can be incorporated into different outfits.  In conclusion, this black T-shirt earns a solid four-star rating from me. Its style, durability, and overall comfort outweigh the slight disappointments I had with regards to softness and length. If you're in search of a versatile and stylish black T-shirt, this one is definitely worth considering, keeping in mind personal preferences for softness and length.",36

The first shirt I ended up cutting a hole in the seam.  Had to stitch it. The other ones I just trimmed very closely down but the tag is not completely out.
