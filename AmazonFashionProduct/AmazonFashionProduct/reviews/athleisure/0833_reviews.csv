Nanzeeee,Very backside enhancing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26F9A4X55C800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCD95J6D,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 7, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Indigo Blue,Verified Purchase,"I purchased these for size based on other people's reviews. I am 5'8"" 153lbs and got a medium.  The backside and length fit fine, but the front crotch area had creases of loose gaping, which didn't flatter my frontside. I used these for core and pilates training with resistance bands, and they felt great and washed well. I was left wondering is a smaller size would have fit better. The only concern is that due to them being cut lower in the back your undergarments have to fit accordingly.  I plan on only wearing these for home workouts as they definitely draw attention to your glutes.",
