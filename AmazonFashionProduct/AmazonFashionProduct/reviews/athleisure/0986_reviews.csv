Medium chest size. I bought these to workout in. I was needing some more relaxed/baggy fit shirts. I’m 3 months postpartum. I ordered a large after seeing people’s reviews to size up because they were not oversized enough when purchased at normal size. I received them and tried them on. They fit me like they would my husbands XL tshirts (I sleep in) so way too big. I was going to keep one to wash it but it’s only 30% cotton so won’t shrink much. I do like the three colors I got. I will be reordering them in a medium. Sad that they are now not on sale and out of some of the original colors I ordered. They seemed soft. Excited to workout in them.,
