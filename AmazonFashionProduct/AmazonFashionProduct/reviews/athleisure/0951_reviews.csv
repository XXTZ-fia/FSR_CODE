Not comfortable, very scratchy. I thought would be like just a loose knit but it feels like it’s made of plastic.",
Kelsi,Cute top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OM116HIOG7T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGXSC5SF,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2025",Color: Navy BlueSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"It’s super sheer so you can’t wear it on its own, but super cute top for wearing over sports bras! I’m usually a size M, but i wanted a tighter fit so i sized down to a S and it’s perfect.",2
Mary Ankenbruck,New favorite workout top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3A54OH1TMS6SA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGXSC5SF,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 9, 2024",Color: Orange RedSize: X-Large,,This top is extremely flattering and my new favorite for the gym! I appreciate the lower neckline that still provides good coverage. I also love the strategic ruching on the sides that is incredibly flattering. I love the vibrant tomato red type color and appreciate how it can mix and match with leggings of all different hues. It seems true to size and really comfortable. I will definitely be buying more.,2

Amazon Customer,"Sheer, size up",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RN2BSKM9FDL9U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGXSC5SF,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 12, 2024",Color: WhiteSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"It was a lot more sheer than the photo showed which but I don’t mind that, I can wear it in warmer weather too. I actually think this would be cute outside of the gym. Makes you look more snatched but the back part bunches up a little bit. I’m usually an XL with a long torso so I got a 2XL and I’ll probably get it in a few other colors.",4
Sophie A.,Cute workout top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WEKO3E1X3QES/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGXSC5SF,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 12, 2024",Color: WhiteSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"The material is super lightweight but a little see-through, which is a little bit of a downer. However, it is super flattering on, the material is super comfortable and stretchy. The ruching is very flattering and cinches you in. And the back peep hole is really cute. Would recommend more for warmer days. I would stick to your normal size, or go up a size for a more spacious fit.",
Brittany,VERY Thin,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R338HS1P3TRIN1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGXSC5SF,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 11, 2024",,,"This is SUPER cute, but the material is VERY thin and see-thru.  I wouldn't want to wear something so sheer to workout in public, but it's perfectly fine for at home.  THe design is a bit weird with the scoop bottom, but it actually looks very flattering.  4 Stars",
Nicole,Love it comfortable and cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R149XA5WODB7D5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGXSC5SF,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 10, 2024",Color: PinkSize: X-Large,,I really like this shirt. I use it for a workout shirt and absolutely love it. The color is very cute and the shirt is comfortable. I am a larger girl for sure and was worried about it riding up and due to my large chest my shirt being see-through but I was pleasantly surprised that it was not. It is pretty thin so in the cold months you definitely will need a cover but other than that no issues. It has a cute little wrinkle design as well. I could definitely see myself getting more in the future.,
Crystal,"A lot smaller than expected, but very flattering!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IU48H5UNJ4N6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGXSC5SF,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 29, 2024",Color: Orange RedSize: X-Large,,"This fits a lot tighter than I expected, but it’s an incredibly flattering fit. The color is gorgeous (I opted for the reddish coral color). The sleeves are kind enough, but barely.  The fabric is very thin, so this is excellent for workouts when it is hot. I wore it on a 60-70 degree Fahrenheit day, and it was almost too cool.  Great shirt and I felt very sexy wearing it—I would recommend this to others.",3
