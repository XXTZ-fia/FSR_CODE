Amazon Customer,Comfiest piece of clothing I’ve ever ordered from Amazon!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CP3TVH58H8BR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B3D9CYQG,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 31, 2023",Color: BlueSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"The material is so soft and comfy. It is the perfect thickness (it feels high quality, not too thin, but still lightweight). I am 5ft 3in, women’s size 10 and the size large was the perfect length and perfect amount of room around the legs and stomach while still looking structured and well-fitting. I have never purchased a piece of clothing from Amazon that I actually liked, but I took a chance due to the positive reviews and I love it! I hope this helps :)",11

The material is super soft and the colors are true to the photos. They do look a bit like pajamas so I am not sure I would wear these sets out and about. My only complaint is that the pants fit a little weird in the crotch area. Maybe I should have ordered one size up to avoid this but the top fits great. Just be aware normal size may be a bit snug on the hips if you are blessed in that area,8

I can’t say how they’ll wear and wash long term but out of the bag…fantastic!  I immediately ordered another color.  Rust was more pink than I thought it would be…kind of salmon color.

The cropped top is boxy and flowy, which sometimes allows a cool draft so I recommend wearing a shirt underneath in cooler weather.
