The fabric is a nice weight—definitely not cheap—and it’s super stretchy and comfortable. I appreciate the great length, especially since I’ve had issues with sleeve and inseam lengths in other sets. For reference, I’m 5'9"", 215lbs, and a 38 DDDD/G. My inseam for flats is 33/34 inches and 36 inches with heels. These fit perfectly, and the cuffed design works well.
