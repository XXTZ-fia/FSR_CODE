I’m about a B cup right now and you can see my mom nips from afar!!! But hey my husband is OK with it 😂.  The shirt is very supportive, like a bra but not as tight. I’ve always struggled with finding comfy bras cause I’m more of a 38B or 38 A, which is hard to find. But these are supportive enough and comfy.

Buying more!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2430KITCFLSFU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB5KDBL6,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Special Size: Waist LengthSize: Medium-LargeColor: White+gray+black,Verified Purchase,"(My info: 5’8, 130, 36DDD, 37-29-37) I ordered a Medium and they fit perfect! I needed a longer tank to be able to tuck into my jeans at work because cropped tanks are not allowed. And these fit the bill even though I wear high-rise jeans. They stay tucked in, don’t pop out, and are super comfortable and keep their shape all day long. I don’t find myself having to readjust the tank. I.e. pull it down tuck it back in adjust the girls, etc. it stays in place for a full 8 to 12 hours that I’m mixing drinks and running around behind the bar.  I’m a huge fan of ribbed tanks because they tend to hold up and keep their shape better, longevity wise, than traditional cotton for long-term abuse and workwear. I wear the black one multiple times a week for work and it always looks great. It shows just enough of the girls to encourage tips, but not be obscene.  Note I also ordered these tanks in the traditional square next style in medium, but they were too big so I will be ordering those ones in a small so just be aware that your sizing may vary style by style.",2

I had to wear pasties to make sure the girls weren't showing. But loved the fit and the mid-body waist line. It did roll up a few times and I had to pull it down but not too bad. I'm just really self conscious about my midriff. Having 3 kids it's not my 20 year old body anymore. But with a high waist Jean or shorts I love these tops. I haven't washed them yet so I'm not sure if they will shrink. Also I am smaller chested (34B) and these would not support bigger chests. It's not like a sports bra. But I love that it was tight enough where I didn't have to wear a bra. Life saver when it comes to new mexico heat.,
