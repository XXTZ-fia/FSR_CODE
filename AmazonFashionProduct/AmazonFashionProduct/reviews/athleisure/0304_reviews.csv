Brooklynn Priest,They fit so good!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R258KWTRCEA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CC2HQDFY,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 21, 2024","Size: LargeColor: Black,black",Verified Purchase,I ordered large. Im 5’5 and 187lbs postpartum. They look good with my boots but without boots they are long and go under the heel of my foot. I’m not complaining one bit I would rather them be a little longer than to look like I’m getting ready for a flood lol. I love the flare. The material is not see through and is thick. I’ve had them about a week so far and they are holding up great. I washed them separately and hung to dry. They are pretty stretchy but enough to hold you in and shape you up. They are really comfortable and don’t roll down when you sit or bend. I will definitely be buying some different colored ones now.,17

They fit perfectly and the high waist stays in place during my workouts. The fabric is stretchy and soft, and there are no annoying seams to deal with.  **Material:** The material is great—soft, breathable, and keeps me cool even when I'm sweating. They're thick enough to be squat-proof, which is awesome. After several washes, they still look and feel like new.  **Performance:** I've worn these for yoga, running, and weightlifting, and they work perfectly for everything. The ribbed texture makes them super comfy and flexible, and the slight compression feels supportive without being too tight.  **Style:** The colors are really nice and I've gotten a lot of compliments on them. They look good with a bunch of different tops, so I wear them even when I'm not working out.  **Overall:** I'm really happy with the OQQ Women's 2 Piece Yoga Pants Ribbed Seamless set. They're comfy, durable, and look great. Highly recommend!",13

So I bought these two pairs and they were not the same. In the brownish color ones it had the same great feel but the pant legs were too long and they would drag and that was annoying. The black pair was very tight on my thighs and hips but still fit and wasn’t as elastic as the others, the waist band wasn’t as tall or long as the others.

I’m 5’4 and the pants come past my ankles, unlike a few reviews I read who are around my height or shorter. I will say, I could’ve gotten a medium instead of a small, I’m 127. The small is a great size for somone who doesn’t have thighs, a butt or muscles (and that’s ok) but if you’re the toned/have more muscle, thighs and a butt kind of 5’4, get a medium.  The sizing. I think if you want a longer pant leg, go up a size. Now, this is just s theory based off of reviews. Also, if you have a high butt or big butt, your pant legs may be higher (or rise up past your ankles). You can size up but you don’t have to. They have enough give but also don’t be delusional. Think about your body and the way clothes fit in you and whatever look you’re trying to convey, give it. Just be comfortable and don’t get too tight clothes, you’ll end up with stomach issues.",49
