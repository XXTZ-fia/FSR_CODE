It’s also just a comfortable dress that you can dress up or down. I spent the day wandering around the parks & then wore it to a fancy dinner that night as well. You can dress it up or down. Girl code states that dresses that have pockets are far superior & this dress does not disappoint. I love this dress that when I have stuff in my pockets it doesn’t all slouch to one side bc of the tied waist. Black dress is a large and green is a medium. I like both fits for different reasons! Tempted to order the burnt orange color as well. 😬😅,

I love the color I ordered the fabric feels wonderful. But unfortunately, without a size chart in the listing, it was hard to know what size to get. I have a smaller upper body with my measurements being 35 and a 28 inch waist but then my hips are a 40 or 41 so based on the pictures I could tell that the bottom was a little more slim so I ordered a large thinking I would just be able to cinch the waist. Well to cinch the waste by 10 inches obviously is not going to work. Super disappointed that there’s no size chart in the listing.",4

I am a D cup and i have plenty of room in the XL.  i am a bigger girl and sometimes in the sporty clothing i need a 2XL because I do not have an athlete's body.  so i was really happy with how well the XL fit.  Roomy up top and even with my pre-meno belly coming in, I am able to create a little bit of a blousey effect.  the fabric is SUPER lightweight which will be awesome on hot TX summer days.  It is a little shorter on me, so i will wear a pair of shorts with it, but there is plenty of space for them under.  pockets are amazing and the raceback gives it a more of the sporty look.  i am super pleased that i took a chance on the XL - it fits perfectly and will be a 'cool' addition to my summer wardrobe.  i am already picking out which planned activities i will be wearing it for.",7

I love this dress! I ordered it in all 3 colors.  The fit is flattering and true to size. The weight of the fabric is substantial enough for coverage but light enough for comfort in warm weather. I really like the cut of the dress - the back of the dress is slightly longer than the front for modesty.  For reference, I am 5'6"" 128 lbs and ordered size small.  And it is quick-dry!",12
