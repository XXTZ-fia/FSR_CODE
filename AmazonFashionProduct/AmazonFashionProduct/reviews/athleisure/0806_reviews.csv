When I say a fun twist, I mean this is not your mom’s warmup outfit…this is super cute and so on-trend.  You get a cute skort with 2 pockets in the shorts portion of the skort, perfect for keys, ID, and your phone, meaning that you can bring all those imperative essentials (and not a bag!) when you go out to walk, run, play tennis, etc. The material is super soft, again, not a sweatsuit per se, but has that heavier weight feel that you need during cooler months, without the “sweat suit” feel. The material is super soft and comfy, and if you want to you can even lounge around the house in this on the weekends…it’s that comfy. But what I love most about this outfit is that you can have that comfy feel, while looking cute.  The shorts underneath didn’t seem to ride up while working out in it, the skort is a nice length, about 1-2 inches above my knee (I’m 5’8” for reference) is not see through, has a nice classic line, and is cute to mix and match. There is a drawstring ribbon at the waist, perfect for adjusting easily if you do lose weight, so this will still fit beautifully during that transition.  The neckline isn’t to high or low, actually it is just right, and the relaxed collared neckline adds a little panache and style to the shirt, and it has almost a split high-low hemline. The material for both skort and shirt are stretchy, yet it holds its shape.  I ordered this in the charcoal gray for something different, but do love all the color options with this! Also, I ordered up a size just because I like my exercise clothes super roomy, but could easily go down one size, and would be fine.  This is that something cute that you can splurge on for those cooler months (think Fall!) when the weather gets a little cooler, but you still want to be comfortable when you work out.",2
