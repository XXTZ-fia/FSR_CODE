Finding joggers that fit both my lower legs and waist is the world's most complicated task. These 4-way stretch golf joggers are the first joggers that fit my body type great, while also being extremely comfortable and durable. I ordered the XL with the 30 inch inseam. The length is perfect as well. The material offers the perfect amount of thickness and stretch, and does not feel cheap at all. I've put them through about 3-4 washes already and they quality remains the same. The quality of these joggers make them an absolute steal at the price they're sold for. In my opinion, CRZ yoga joggers are almost/just as good as more expensive luxury brands for a great price.",

The are fitting to your legs, and not too baggy. They are great for showing off your legs. The zippers work well enough, and I’m happy with the khaki color. The best thing is that this brand has a 32” inseam and finding joggers for guys that are tall can really suck. I’m 6’6, and these are perfect.",

He’s been picky about pants- can’t be too slim fit and I’m picky about them being too short (he’s 6’2’ , 34” inseam). He doesn’t say much about clothes but actually commented he loves them and seeing him wear them everyday conformed it. I actually ordered another pair in case they sold out his size. Coincidentally my husband said “oh those look nice” so I ordered him a pair…he immediately loved them and said “I wouldn’t mind having a few more pairs!” FYI he has a bunch of “travel /athletic” pants from bike, Banana republic, Dicks, and target. These are by far the best. Obviously never tried Lululemon because I haven’t been able to justify spending $100 on one pair but I would imagine they are similar. Very happy both my guys love them and usually don’t say much about clothes unless they are really bad or really good.",2

I’m insistent on zip pockets. These joggers are really great. Feel good, good stretch, good color selections.  I’d love if they made these in track pant or heavier fabric, put the drawstring on the inside and lost the elastic ankle cuff. The only negative on these are the zippers. They’re sensitive and a little on the cheap end. I’d be more than willing to pay more for a quality bump. These are lightweight very comfortable joggers you can’t go wrong with.",5

My only criticism is there is no back pocket. These are labeled “golf”, but there’s no back pocket to put your glove in. I wear these every week (I have 3 pair) for work in a PT clinic. They’re super flexible to allow for all sorts of dynamic movements. I wear these more often than my lulu joggers, and at around a third of the cost. All the zippers work smoothly and the elastic has held up to 50+ washes without starting to sag. Safe to say I’ll get more IF these ever wear out. Oh yeah, they hold up to fading as well. Many days in hostile NC sun playing golf and cycles through the washing machine and they all maintain their color.",8

Paul H.,A decent Lululemon alternative,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HM3HGHCWX0R5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ74M21V,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 29, 2023",Fit Type: 30 inchesSize: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love my Lululemon ABC Jogger. I have two pair. I want to buy a third but don't want to pay $128+tax. After researching, I found the Crazy Yoga golf jogger. PROS: Similar stretchy, comfy, wicking fabric. True to fit. I'm 6'1"" and 210 lbs. and a large 30"" inseam fits well. Shallow but zippered front pockets, helpful to hold keys and other objects. Zipper cuff, making it easier to don and doff. Also, if you don't like it snug around the ankle. 1/4 the price of Lulus. CONS: A little tighter on the leg than my Lulus, taking away from comfort. Small, scrunchy cuff at the bottom instead of the nice cuffs on the Lulus. No back pocket. However, all-in-all, a nice alternative to Lululemon ABC Warpstreme joggers at a fraction of the price. Can't yet speak to the durability because I just got them.",12

I wear joggers from Lulu and Viori and these are really close. My only complaint is the zippers on the ankles aren’t the best.

I wanted ankle zippers and pocket zippers and these are one of few with both. Zippers work well. They will be great for driving and as extra layer over cycling shorts in cold weather. I had read a couple complaints about not having an elastic band with the drawstring but I beg to differ because the whole pants stretch. More waist elastic seems redundant. Color Black.
