Trust me when I say that it’s so versatile! Throw it together with a pair of jeans, leggings, sweats and it dresses up your outfit! I ordered a large because I wanted it to be a bit roomy. The quality of the material is really really nice!! It’s a waffle design and not thin material. It wears nicely and hangs over areas that you might want to cover up. The sleeves have a little cap at the end so if you needed to pull them up, the will stay up. It’s really a darling top and I can’t say enough about it. I don’t put mine in the dryer but it’s a preferred choice. It’s somewhat a heavier lifting top, meaning…it’s not cheaply made which is why it feels a bit heavier material than others. I ordered the apricot which came in a more of a creamy look than what the photo shows. All in all, the top is good quality material and I love it and so will you!",8

From 1st impression, I wasn't expecting it to be so thin. As you can see in my last photo it's VERY sheer, almost like a ""net"" (if that makes sense). Almost seems like more of a bathing suit cover than a sweater/sweatshirt. It will be ok for fall to layer with another shirt, but if you plan to wear it alone, it will most definitely NOT provide any warmth. Would be nice in warmer weather with a tank top underneath. That said, I'll probably keep it because I don't own anything like it and don't feel like returning it. For reference, I'm 5'6"" and I ordered size L, which fits oversized.",36
