Linda Hibberd,Grape color is actually blue but it's a nice shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PGJA1DNSJBK9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T8GXL1R,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 20, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Grape,Verified Purchase,"I ordered 2 other style shirts from this company.  The medium in 2 styles was a bit more fitted than I like so I had to return them and order up a size.  So when I ordered this one, I ordered the large and it looks a bit too big on me.  I ordered the ""grape"" color but it's definetly not as pictured, closer to a blue.  The shirt is on the long side which is nice if you don't want your buns to fully be visible in your leggings.  The neck is a bit wide but I'm sure it's due to the larger size.  Sleeves have plenty of room.  The design is different, very comfortable.  So other than the color being off for ""grape"" and me apparently being between 2 sizes for this company, I like their shirts.",

The color purple is not anything like shown in the photo, it's more of a soft lavender shade which reminds me of Easter eggs.
