The textured fabric makes it very attractive. It's lightweight, and the fabric in between the textured parts is basically sheer. So while it is a ""jacket"", don't plan on wearing it for warmth. It also runs on the small side. I normally wear a Large. It isn't loose-fitting on me, like I had hoped, but it does fit. It's stretchy, but I definitely can't wear anything underneath it, other than a cami. This is definitely a fashion piece! I do recommend it, and the price is worth it.

I'm not wild about the material though. It's stretchy and kinda form-fitting, but the collar is weird. It doesn't look or feel right when it's fully zipped, so I do leave it mostly unzipped and I fold down the collar. It looks fine that way. I think it would have been nice to have it up though. Not a deal breaker! I think this is a nice pullover; definitely a casual item for me.",

The lightweight and airy material is ideal for fall weather. The intricate texture of the fabric adds a touch of elegance to an otherwise casual piece. The half-zip neckline creates a modern, sporty touch that complements the feminine silhouette.  The fit is true to size, and the sleeves are a perfect length. I am particularly impressed with the high quality of the stitching and materials, which suggest that this top will last several seasons.  Overall, the Dokotoo Women’s Casual Half Zip Sweatshirts are not your average sweatshirt. They are versatile and stylish tops that can be dressed up or down for various occasions. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a unique and comfortable addition to their fall wardrobe.",3

The garment is very well sewn without any loose threads anywhere. Sadly, I expect the top will be prone to collecting snags over time so it will require me to use extra caution to prolong its useful lifetime. The textured pattern is slimming and may successfully camouflage all but the worst of any snags that occur. I expect to wear this often over a t-shirt. It is an exceptionally comfortable garment.",
