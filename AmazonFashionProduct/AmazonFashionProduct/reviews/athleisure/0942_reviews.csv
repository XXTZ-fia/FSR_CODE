I ordered the Small peachy pink with strips.  The fabric felt very nice and the pants pockets were very convenience.  I liked the fit of the top, but the pants were much too big in the crouch.  I decided to re-order in X-Small (different color) and the pants fit and the length was fine for wearing with casual sneakers; but the top’s sleeves were too short. .  Then I realized it appears that the X-Small only comes in Petite - no regular length X-small.  That said, I like the style so I kept them both and will have the Small pants taken up to better fit my body.  With better fit I would have given it 4 stars and that plus pockets in the top would have gotten it 5 stars.",
