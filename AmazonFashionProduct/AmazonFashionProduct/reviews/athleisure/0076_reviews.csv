I wanted something comfortable but light well still looks stylish. I purchased the black in a small. Fits true to size This outfit did not disappoint. Perfect for airport lounging and I felt cute in it.  I’ve had it for a month and have worn it close to 4-5x. However now the fabric is pilling and fading and the waist band has rolled/twisted. I did purchase it in sale for close to $20 so I’m not to upset that it hasn’t lasted long. I’m going to keep trying to untwist the waist band and hope to get some more wear out of it.,2

Amazon Customer,I'll be buying this in every color!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R285M3WCB9YSDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08P1JGJD8,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 24, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Dark Blue,Verified Purchase,"I have found my new wardrobe staple. This set is so comfortable and looks cute too! You really can't tell that it is 2 pieces--it looks just like a jumpsuit. You get the style of a jumpsuit/romper and the ease of a two-piece (no more weird stripping down in the bathroom). Win-win! I feel like I'm wearing pajamas all day when I'm in this set but it's cute enough that I can go about town and run my errands without people thinking I'm wearing pajamas. You can pull the leg up higher on your calf for a sportier look or let them fall naturally. I'm 5'9"" and cuff falls about 2.5 inches above my ankle.  As far as it being flattering? I mean, it's an elastic waistband with pockets so you're going to have a little bit of hip action happening but it's nothing major. I've also noticed that underwear lines are somewhat obvious but honestly, who cares about that anymore? Not me!  I tend to be a medium but Amazon recommended I order a large and that was definitely the right choice. So I'd suggest going with what Amazon recommends for you as well.  I ordered the blue but will absolutely be ordering more in the other colors. People in my life should be prepared to see me in this set, in all the colors, all of the time. Even as the temperatures fluctuate, this is an adaptable look. I am currently wearing this with a cardigan and sneakers since it's a little cooler here today and it looks just as cute as with no sweater and sandals.  I have not yet washed this so how durable it is remains to be seen. I plan to gentle wash and line dry...which is annoying but I don't want this to be altered at all so I'm willing to suck it up and line dry.  Excuse me now...I need to go buy the remaining colors.",31

Also, the listing says the fabric is 65% polyester and 35% cotton but the tag sewed onto the tank top and jogger says it's 65% polyester, 30% viscose, and 5% elastane (in other words, all synthetic).

curt miles,Super Comfy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28M7LKN17HJC8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08P1JGJD8,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 15, 2022",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Amazon suggested I order a large in this outfit but after reading reviews I decided to size down to a medium. So glad I did!!! I’m 5’5” around 165 lbs and the pants still are a little roomy however, the top is a little more fitting and not as roomy as the model makes it appear to be. I suppose that is due to my size D chest! So overall I love the comfort of the outfit, but would probably just wear it to run to the store, lounge in at home or even PJ’s rather try to dress it up to go out in.",
