These shorts are not only stylish, but they are incredibly comfortable to wear. The fabric is soft and lightweight, making them perfect for everyday wear or for a casual outing.  The fit of the shorts is just right, not too tight or too loose, and the length is perfect for my preference. The material is of high quality and feels durable, these shorts will last me for a long time.  I have received numerous compliments when wearing these shorts, and I find myself reaching for them time and time again. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a comfortable and stylish option for summer or casual wear. Overall, I rate these shorts as very good and extremely comfortable – a must-have for anyone's wardrobe.",2

These are definitely the pickleball style shorts I was looking for. The v shaped waist band is very flattering and does have some compression which I need as a mom of multiple kids! The shorts underneath are perfect for comfort and movement, they do hit right on your very upper thigh where volleyball shorts would. Another plus is that they have pockets for your phone!! The shorts have a cute flow to them when you walk and move. These are so cute. **Update several months later: when I washed these the color almost completely faded (in picture) they were light pink and now they’re more of an off-white, maybe I would have more luck with another color. I still wear them and love how cute and flowy they are, despite the fading color they are honestly so comfortable to wear in hot weather so I continue to wear these.  **Another update: I bought these in brown and have washed them several times, the brown holds up much better and the color has not faded. I might go back for black, I truly love these.",18

It feels like silky/butter on your skin.  The skort is cute but not for my body type. I have large hips and a good size caboose and i felt like these made them even bigger and it just wasn't flattering to me. Now, I know I am about 30 pounds over weight (5'4"" 160 lb), so I don't necessarily blame the product, just wanted to let others know. I also want to point out, these are SKORTS, meaning that there is a separation in the middle.  I initially thought this was a skirt with shorts underneath. Again, it was my mistake, not the product. For me the skort factor added an unflattering look.I think these would look adorable on a slimmer build and I'm definitely gonna look for other options by the manufacturer, because I love the lightweight material and color.For reference, I bought a large and it fit well.",4

I have a small waist and bigger thighs and I struggle to find shorts that fit well at the waist and the legs and these are amazing. They compliment my body type while giving me a hour glass with the crossing. The only thing I don’t like about the pockets is there’s only one on the right side , so if you like to put things in both sides of your pockets that would be a problem.  I highly recommend these shorts especially if you do running sports or marching band like me.

Got black and brown, brown is not something I’d wear in front of other people without a really modest shirt bc it shows all of my imperfections but I will be wearing the black. They are soft as other reviews mentioned BUT they’re athletic fabric so if you’re not into that, be warned. I could see them being hot- haven’t worn them outside. Also the pocket is at the bottom of the shorts, which is fine I just wasn’t expecting it. Overall would buy black over and over.",
Jacob Moore,Aerie dupe!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LONICPBXP9PP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C1DZ5VPL,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 7, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,I wore these to Disney world and they were so comfortable!

J  Russell,SO soft,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14PATIKB2FJA3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C1DZ5VPL,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 20, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,I literally never write reviews but these are so good I couldn’t resist. I was absolutely floored by the quality. They feel like lululemon or aerie leggings with how soft they are and are also the perfect length! I’m 3 months postpartum and weigh 145lbs and ordered a medium and they are so comfy and flattering! They hold you in nicely but aren’t too compressive. I’m already looking to see which color to buy next!,
