Just a note — I’ve only worn it for lounging, not for exercise. I have a longer torso and usually avoid rompers, but the adjustable straps make this one more wearable.  The built-in bra is a mixed bag for me. I appreciate the removable padding and the bit of built-in support, but as someone who’s a bit chestier, it doesn’t quite offer enough support for me. While it’s not uncomfortable or causing any spillage, I’d definitely need a separate sports bra if I were to wear this for a workout. In that case, I’d prefer no built-in bra so I could use my own.  It’s definitely flattering, though the shorts do ride up a bit, which could be an issue during physical activity. For lounging or running errands, it’s not a problem. Overall, it’s a comfy and cute piece that works well for casual wear, even if it’s not ideal for more active use.",3
