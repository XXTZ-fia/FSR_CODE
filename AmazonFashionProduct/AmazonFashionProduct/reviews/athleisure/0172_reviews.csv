The fit is impeccable, hugging the body in all the right places without restricting movement. It’s a rare find that’s true to size, making online shopping a breeze.  The color palette is another standout feature. Each hue is vibrant and energizing, perfectly capturing the essence of an active lifestyle. I was so enamored with the design that I couldn’t resist purchasing it in three different colors.  But what truly sets this outfit apart is the fabric. It’s soft to the touch, yet durable enough to withstand the rigors of intense workouts. It breathes well, keeping you cool and comfortable no matter how much you sweat.  In a market flooded with options, this workout outfit shines as a ‘got to have’ item. Whether you’re a fitness enthusiast or just looking for comfortable athleisure wear, this outfit won’t disappoint. It’s a testament to what workout apparel should be: functional, fashionable, and utterly flawless.",8
Kathy Kagan,Awesome set for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLG6NP3SUATHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B8YTQHKM,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 3, 2023",Color: Pink UpdateSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,I’m 5’7” 108# so naturally I ordered the small originally (pink old). I’m usually a size 2 at finer stores and a 4-6 at Wally World. The leggings and shorts were too small. The old pink (pink color on shorts and leggings waistband) shorts were very short and the leggings had shorts attached which I didn’t like. Got the “M” set (pink new- solid black leggings and shorts + shorts are longer and no shorts attached to the leggings). Fit was perfect for all 5 pieces. Bra size for me is a 34B and I feel supported but not squished. Great deal. Order up,17

I did notice it came with shorts but the pants have shorts already built in which I did not notice in the pictures. The pants fit perfect but the extra pair of shorts were a bit tight in the waistline but I am going to the gym almost everyday so I expect to fit them as well. The top, shirt, and jacket fit excellent as well.",

The set includes a comfortable and stylish yoga top, sports bra, leggings, shorts, and jacket - all made with high-quality, breathable materials that feel great on my skin.  The yoga top is flowy and lightweight, making it perfect for a variety of workouts, and the sports bra provides the perfect amount of support. The leggings and shorts fit like a glove and stay in place during even the most intense workouts. I love the high-waisted design, which provides a flattering and secure fit.  The whole set is so comfortable and functional, and it's become my go-to for yoga, Pilates, and even running errands.  Not only is the quality of the set fantastic, but the price is unbeatable. I've seen similar sets for much more money, but this one is just as good, if not better. I would highly recommend this 5 piece exercise yoga outfit set to anyone looking for a comfortable, stylish, and affordable workout outfit.",8
MK,"Great fit, good reliable workout set",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R359NMRZ5HW3W6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B8YTQHKM,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 9, 2023",Color: GraySize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"Great workout set. Definitely I prefer the version with the color strip around the waist and of the pant and shorts. Has a great look.  Super comfy, really holds me in in a professional athletic way. I like the grippiness of the fabric — it makes doing yoga, and things like arm balances or tree posture very good, because the fabric nicely holds stickiness in a way that promotes the posture. Many leggings are too slippery or pull when I’m tree post or they fall down etc. not these.  I am a professional yoga teacher and workout almost every day. I love wearing these sets for a comfortable and professional looking practice. Waistband stays high. Colors are good. Sports bra looks great and shorts are sexy while not overly revealing. I use them with a bohemian skirt coverup and seamlessly go from gym to classy coverup in moments. Jacket feels great and is lightweight.  Overall I’m very pleased. I have this set in multiple colors. Feels sturdy and adds to my confidence in the gym and studio. I’ve never once had to compromise with a wedgie nor any underwear or waist band showing. Shirt stays in place even in inversions. Looks good. Professional set: would buy again and in more colors. Wardrobe staple.",19

Super amazed! The only thing I will say is I got the largest size and it worked for me. I'm quite curvy and was nervous about it. I think it could be slightly improved by adding a different size element to the bra top. Any bigger than double d will be uncomfortable. But it's wonderful!",

The shorts have like an added barrier which I wasn't expecting but could come in handy if you exercise a lot (or could chaff, I don't do a lot of over exertion (bought more for lounging around my house/housework) so I'm not sure if they would chaff or not, just an assumption). The added shorts/cloth on the legging is surprisingly comfortable and you really don't notice the shorts immediately - so would be great if someone is a bit self-conscious on their front view in leggings. And the color is very beautiful. Material is thick so you can't see through it but feels thin enough to not cause horrible over heating. All in all very happy with this combo purchase. Great price for so many items you couldn't get them at the same price if you purchased separately. Appreciate the bundled items!",2

Jacklyn martin,"Nice breathable soft material, absolutely loved it",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1G8JKHNMVVSYV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B8YTQHKM,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 2, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"Extremely comfortable breathable fabric. package was a little small so I was worried I got too small a  size, but everything fits great. The fabric stretches nicely while exercising and is pretty soft definitely not a bad price at all either. My only issue was with the leggings I thought the shorts might come off them but they do not it's the actual design of them but that isn't that big of an issue they still look cute as they are.",
