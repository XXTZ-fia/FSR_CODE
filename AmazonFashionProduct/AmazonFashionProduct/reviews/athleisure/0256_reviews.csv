My height is 4’9” and I weight 95lbs. I ordered the extra small jacket and it fits perfectly with such a chopped cute look .This jacket is super comfortable very light Weight, perfect for anyone working out/ going for a run, for anyone wanting to cover their arms for protection inside stores  or outside. I love that this jacket is Not see through which is a bonus in my book .  I live in Louisiana so it’s perfect for the southern heat. I also really love that this jacket comes with pockets and goes with pretty much anything. Definitely planning on buying more. Overall, this is a great purchase :)",
kimawonton,Very cute and comfy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WLBILQEVFCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09DWT82WD,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 3, 2023",Color: GravelSize: X-Small,Verified Purchase,"This jacket popped up as I was perusing for more running gear that I probably don't need and it immediately caught my eye. I added it to my cart in a few colors, but decided it was probably best if I just bought one to try it on first. Let me just say, I'll be ordering more. It's a super light, but comfortable material. It's perfect to keep me warm in the office that my boss keeps at near arctic temps, but can transition to the warm, Texas weather outside fairly seamlessly. It hits me at a really nice length, coming down just below the smallest part of my waist. I like when my tops and jackets fit looser and this jacket fits the bill. I had originally placed the jackets in a small in my cart while I mulled it over, but luckily after reading comments, I changed that to an x-small. Fits like a dream.  For reference, I'm 5'-4"" with a relatively stalky, athletic build and the x-small fits perfect with tons of room in the body and arms for layering.",3

A,Good but exposed wrists *sigh* with update,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R7ERR4YH4MZV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09DWT82WD,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 17, 2022",Color: BlackSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I got the medium. I am pear shaped, even tho its a boxy square crop, its whatever lol..  My biggest con is i wish the sleeves were longer to cover my wrists. Looking at all the photos after the fact, it seems it was designed to have a crop to it when raising your arms - ever so slightly.  Which I'll be doing lots of because I'm an event wedding photographer / videographer who lifts equipment everywhere and all the time.  I'm outside often to capture ceremony, portraits, etcetc. Especially during peak sun hours and high UV. I'm very pale skinned and care about preventing sun damage, burning, and photo aging. So the spf factor was a major selling point to this jacket ( i wouldn't know how to test that tho ). I always use sunscreen for wedding days. Spf 45 Sunscreen blended into my spf 15 makeup. Even sunscreen to my neck, chest, shoulders as a precaution. And I reapply sunscreen spf 50 spray every 2 hours. By the end of one wedding 95° and UV9, the bride - and everyone was absolutely reddened. I was not. So sun care is very very important (at least to me...) and this jacket claims to provide that.  It can be very difficult finding the perfect attire for the job. Before this jacket, i was using an exercise one with a white stripe (good for the sweat but not all black and more casual in look), and an all cotton black one which can start to smell from the day's sweat.  So here comes this jacket, spf protection, all black, and breathable sports wear that can blend in with a professional outfit.  EDIT :// After putting this jacket to use, it is not wrinkle proof. It would need to be steamed every job.. which is what i wanted to grt rid of. Also items have fallen out of my pockets such as chapstick and credit card from bending over while i work. I thought I'd keep batteries and extras in the pockets because it has a diagonal tilt downwards but you should think twice keeping anything in there ESPECIALLY EXERCSING god forbid running. There is no zippered pockets which would make the design so much better. I also don't feel comfortable keeping my phone in the pocket because it feels too heavy for the fabric. And the fabric feels it would sag over time from repeated weight usage. Really a chapstick or a few credit cards is the balanced weight limit lol.  I really wish the sleeves were longer. I will still be applying sunscreen to my face and hands, so it's not a ( major ) dealbreaker. But it is disheartening.  I am still on the search for the perfect jacket. Its fine for now since ive kept it..., but it really isnt ideal and has been a letdown given all I've expected out of it.",10
