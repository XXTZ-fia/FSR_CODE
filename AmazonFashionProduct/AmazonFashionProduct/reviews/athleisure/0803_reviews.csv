The hood is NOT tight so it looks cool and is comfortable to turn your head and wear buds underneath while walking etc or at the gym if its cold there. When you sweat there are NO huge giant disgusting sweat bands under the arms. Its NOT changing after 5 washings so far. Still fits the exact same as the first time.
