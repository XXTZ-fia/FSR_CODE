It's thin summer type fabric. I guess it depends on your taste some people that's okay with. So it's probably worth a look but I am sending it back.,

You can easily wear it casually, with jeans or leggings. You can easily dress it up a little bit for wearing to work as well. Well, not for any work that is laborous or anything like that, but an office setting would be ideal. The lacey detailing on the shoulders is really what takes it from a very plain and dull simple long sleeve shirt. Some may not like it though, since it will show a minimal amount of skin, and even possibly bra straps. This hasn't been a problem for me though. I guess it might depend on the setting in which you are wearing it. Or each person's personal preference, style, or modesty.  The only bigger complaint I have with it is the color I ordered. It does look pretty in the pictures, but not so much in reality. It is the same color, I'm not saying that it doesn't match the product description though. Just that it isn't as flattering to me in person. I wish I had ordered the fuschia, rather than rose pink. Or black would be lovely I think. I might just go ahead and order one or two more. Because they are only $20 , they are affordable, which is a fantastic bonus. The shirts are worth this price point. If they were priced higher than $25 or so, then I would not recommend them. Seeing as though they are at a very reasonable price, for the level of quality you get, I definitely recommend them.",
AnotherCustomer,"Fabric Evaluation; Bra Strap Visibility; Loose, Casual Fit",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM7IRD4VAHYXO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5QJ1HYC,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 13, 2024",Size: SmallColor: D Real Teal,,"SIZING A size small was the right size choice for me. For reference, I am 5'8"" tall and weigh 125 lbs., with an average to athletic build. My current measurements are bust 35 inches, waist 27 inches, and hips 35 inches. My bra size can vary between 34D and 36D, depending on the bra, and my underbust measurement is 28 inches. This top extends 6 inches past my belly button. The sleeves sit right at my wrists.  FABRIC This top is definitely suited for fall or winter weather, as advertised, because the fabric doesn’t breathe well. In certain lighting, the Real Teal color can be slightly see-through - I noticed the outline of my black bra underneath, though nothing obscene. The material feels like a typical polyester blend with a noticeable waffle knit texture. The lace patchwork feels a bit scratchy or itchy to me, possibly due to my sensitivity, but it is not a dealbreaker. Despite this, I would still encourage others to try it out.  VISIBLE BRA STRAPS I had not taken into account that my bra straps would be visible through the lace patchwork on the shoulders of this top. Since I prefer not to wear strapless bras and am particular about my bra straps showing, I am not sure how I will manage this. It was my oversight not to consider this beforehand, and something for others to consider.  OVERVIEW This top has a loose fit to it and a casual look. This top is suitable to be worn casually with leggings or jeans and can also be dressed up for work or church with slacks or a skirt. If you can address (or don’t mind) the bra strap visibility issue and your skin is less sensitive than mine, this top could be a great choice for you.",7

What this does is blend VERY casual and slightly warmer waffle knit with a bit of dressier lace for a casual look that could go with more than just jeans.

I was concerned that the weave would be a bit stiff, but it' surprisingly soft for the style.  It has a little elastic in the fabric to allow it to stretch and move with you as you wear it.  The shoulders and upper sleeves are a lace fabric that is a little stiffer, but certainly not uncomfortable.  They are also very breathable, making this top a great choice on a warmer Fall day.  The color is pretty much as pictured and the stitching appears to be even.  I did not see any flaws or tears in the fabric.  I washed it in warm water and let it air dry.  It did not fade or shrink.  Most of the packaging wrinkles came out in the wash and a hot iron took care of the remaining stubborn ones easily.  The top does not have any tailoring and does feel pretty boxy, so I'm not 100% sure I like the style even though it is comfortable.  It also runs a bit large, so you may want to size down if you're between two sizes.",2

The fabric looks and feels cheap, and the waffle weave does not go with the ""lace"" at all, even though the colors match. It just looks super cheap and does not have a flattering cut or fit. The pictures make it look chic but in person it looks juvenile and tacky. Skip this one!",
