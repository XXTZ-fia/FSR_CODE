For the cooler months, it's great for walks and runs.  I would not wear anything under it - it's pretty thin and not baggy, so I thin layering under it would be uncomfortable.

Hopefully this is helpful if you're on the fence.  I'm 5'9, 175-185 lbs range. My figure is overly very shapely with an hour glass figure. Most of my weight is in the butt, hip & thigh area. I have a small waist, 36D bust, long arms (with bat wings!) & long torso.  I have bought every one of these shirts. They are so pretty. I use cold water delicate cycle. No need to put in dryer as the material dries super quick. I put on a hanger to dry.  Things to know before buying:  The shirt fits close so don't expect a flare at the bottom. It DOES cling. . Muffin top will show.  ""Spill over"" in your front bra area will show, again because the shirt is thin material and clings close. Also if you have a lot of ""spill over"", back/side ""fat"" around bra line, it will show. If you don't already know, this type of ""fat"" is actually breast tissue & usually is a result of a poorly fitted bra. (So is ""spill over"") Buy a bra that has higher side material and fits correctly. Cup size is usually the issue. I wear an unpadded bra with a fitted cami to keep those nips from showing.  So, like I said, I have many problem areas in my hips, thigh and butt. For me, this shirt gives a long lean look and easily covers the butt! I can bend over with no ride up.  I wear this to work when I feel like wearing something other than a scrub top. For me the only downside is No Pockets. But I like this shirt so much that it's worth it.  After I received the blue one. I ordered the red. I get sooo many compliments everytime that I ordered every color!!  Obviously no clothing item a miracle worker. Ya gotta work with what you have. I'm glad I took a chance to get this shirt!",111
