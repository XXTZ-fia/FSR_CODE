Ann,excellent workout top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SY7GCBFNE241/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09MK2S9M8,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 25, 2024",Color: PurpleSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I needed a purple workout top to match some recently purchased leggings.  There were several brands on sale since it was Amazon Prime Day.  I chose these (a purple and a white) because of the plethora of positive reviews regarding quality, and the price was a bargain.  When I opened the package I noticed immediately that the purple was just as depicted as was the bright white, and both were quite attractive.  The fabric is lightweight, almost silky, airy, and soft to the touch.  The cut is perfect, the length is flattering (hitting me right at the top of the buttocks) and the construction is flawless making the top extremely flattering.  The armholes and neckline are not revealing but very becoming as is the overall shape of the top.  The breathability of the fabric and airflow helped with cooling during a high intensity workout, and there was no evidence of profuse sweating. There was no twisting, pulling, or flapping as the workout progressed.  When I order workout attire I do so because of the colors, design, and cost. I read reviews and descriptions and try to discern durability and functionality. However, there is no real way to determine the latter. Once I make the decision, I order and hope for the best.  These two tops are ""top notch"" and did not disappoint.  I could not be more pleased with my purchase.Top 3 Likes:-Fabric is lightweight, silky, and very soft-Flattering design in the perfect purple color and handles a vigorous workout well-Cool, airy, and moisture wickingTop 3 Dislikes:-No dislikes!",20
Cecilia W.,Great top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RE06FB06PMGDB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09MK2S9M8,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 2, 2024",Color: Deep BurgundySize: Small,Verified Purchase,"I bought two, one in the teal and the other in the wine color.  Nice fabric that should be easy to wash and beautiful deep colors. They both fit great. Not baggy and not snug, but comfortable and complimentary and a nice fit under the arms. (a must for sleeveless tops for me). I am a runner so can see wearing these on cooler runs and summer picnics. But also think it could easily be worn under a blazer for a more professional look. There is a small reflection stripe on the back but it would not be noticeable if your blazer was on.  Love them.  May buy more.",2

I have several other Baleaf items and hate to leave a less-than-stellar review, but it was very disappointing to find pilling on a $20 shirt so quickly.  It may have been a one-off issue with my shirt or maybe my expectations are off in terms of $, but especially in the absence of any other colors I like, it’s a bit pricy for me to “test out” another one.  As a side note, I would really appreciate other dark color options, such as burnt orange, deep yellow, dark red, navy, etc.",18
