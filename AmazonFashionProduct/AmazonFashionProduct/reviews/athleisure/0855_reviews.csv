YuFlySoLo,"Great fit, Great value",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VB32V72Y5YE9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B078YPN9C7,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 13, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: 139 Orange,Verified Purchase,"It's been at least a couple years since I bought this top and it's still holding up. The fabric is a little heavier than I thought it would be, but it flows nicely. Just this year (again, it's been like 3 or 4 years since I bought it) is the top beginning to exhibit wear and tear issues (fraying thread, a small hole somewhere), so the value and quality of the top is top notch. Coming back to the site to hopefully get a new one in the same color and possibly another. Thanks!",2
offmana,Awesome edition to the closet for many uses,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZECWLZZJQQBT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B078YPN9C7,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 11, 2021",Size: X-LargeColor: 139 Purple,Verified Purchase,"Says what i mean: I initially got it to work in a cold weather climate thinking I could use the shirt and hood and have a layer underneath too. Not only does it work as expected, but the size was spot on, doesn't ""catch"" on things making it have little thingy's and threads popping out - its amazing and smooth. The hood is NOT tight so it looks cool and is comfortable to turn your head and wear buds underneath while walking etc or at the gym if its cold there. When you sweat there are NO huge giant disgusting sweat bands under the arms. Its NOT changing after 5 washings so far. Still fits the exact same as the first time.  Hope it stays ...I bought a second one so the next 5 years I'll always have one handy. I hate clothes shopping soI need things to last. Cheers",11

I do like it, though, but considering the price may or may not buy a second one.  I got the blue one.  The color is pretty and has not faded.  I was it on cold, wrong side out, and hang dry.

I am small chested (34B) with narrow shoulders and carry my weight mostly through my hips and thighs. I was worried that the shoulders and chest would be really baggy with the XL, but that isn't the case. The shirt drapes SO nicely, doesn't drown my shoulders or waist, and flows over my hips. I ordered black and will definitely get more! I have long arms too, so the XL gave me the length I need. I plan on washing it on delicate and line-drying to avoid possibly shrinking the shirt.",

Interestingly enough, it's not exactly a shirt, but it's not totally a hoodie either. It's one of those tunics that you can wear fancy or casual. It does look nice with leggings but if you were it with pants, it still looks amazing. The color is vibrant and does not come off in the wash. Don't wash with hot water though.

It doesn't sit in the washer ever. The tag says it's fine to wash. I don't know what is causing that smell but I can't really wear it in public anymore because it's not an easy to ignore smell.
