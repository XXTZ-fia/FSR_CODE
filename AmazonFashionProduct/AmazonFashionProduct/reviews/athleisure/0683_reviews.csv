The detailing is really cute and I believe probably quite flattering on a number of body types, but I'm not the biggest fan of the construction. For one. the top is REALLY low cut, making it not super functional for most workouts (if thats what you're using it for), even low impact ones. The straps are also set really wide, so the top itself doesnt offer much in the way of support as they kind of will slide down/off your shoulders despite where the strap length is set.  Overall cute look, but just not good for its intended design as a workout/sweat top.",5
