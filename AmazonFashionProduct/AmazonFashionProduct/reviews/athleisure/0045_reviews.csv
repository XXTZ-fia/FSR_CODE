Nicole,Everything I wanted,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FZKDVD00PQP7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CZDX67YD,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 13, 2024",Team Name: Easy PeezySize: LargeColor: Sea Blue,Verified Purchase,"Right out of the package the fabric is soft and sturdy. Well sewn. The color is pretty (dark blue). The dress is a little tricky to get on at first, but it's supportive and flattering. I'm a 36DD and it was a little hard to adjust the straps to tighten up the support, but not a big deal once you get them where you need them. I wish it was a tiny bit shorter, because I'm short but the length isn't awkward. I'm crossing my fingers that it's comfortable in the heat and humidity. I'll update my review is it's not breathable. I got the easy peezy style for the ability to use the restroom without having to take it off. I'm curious if the shorts will get stretched out over time. Definitely would buy more, but it seems like they're having trouble keeping them in stock.",7
MissBrit,Comfy Vacation Outfit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MGTKBZKA56SK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CZDX67YD,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 5, 2024",Team Name: ClassicSize: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I was looking for something comfy to wear to the airport and this athletic dress did not disappoint. The material is so comfy. It compresses at the right spots. My chest was supported well and it was very flattering in the stomach area and hid the mommy tummy. After the airport, I wore this dress in Miami. It was nice and airy which was great on a hot and humid day. I definitely recommend this dress.",
Amazon Customer,"Great fit, flattering at waistline but those with thicc thighs and chest might have a little trouble",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WENKTENT5PDD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CZDX67YD,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 8, 2022",Team Name: ClassicSize: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"**TW: Sizes/dimensions at bottom  This dress is fantastic and a great “dupe” of other athletic/tennis/traveler dresses that are often more expensive! What really sticks out to me is the flattering tapering at the waist line.  This dress can be easily dressed up or down, and is comfortable to walk around/run errands/make a day trip in! I have a larger chest, but felt decently supported in this dress, albeit there is a fair amount of cleavage especially when viewed from the top (not anything over-the-top or uncomfortable though). It also mushes your tatas together a la sports bra and there is no underwire, so do bear that in mind if that is a fit that you dislike.  The material of this dress is a stretchy, smooth athletic material. I love the supportive feeling of the attached bodysuit/romper, which is only stitched to the dress at the neckline, which I think is totally fine as it contributes to the flow of the dress (FYI—the dress can be lifted all the way to reveal the bodysuit underneath. I’m not sure why you’d do that, but you can!). As many others mentioned, you will have to roll the entire dress down off your body to use the restroom as with a one-piece swimsuit, so do bear that in mind in case you’re planning to wear this dress in a less private area!  Additionally, due to the flared/non-fitted fit of the dress, I could eat freely (I bloat without fail whenever I eat—even during low-carb meals!) but still retain that flattering tapered waistline! Huge star in my book. I did notice that after several hours of walking, the shorts ran up a bit and my (quite large/muscular) thighs were definitely chafing which we all know is a terribly uncomfortable experience. Weighing down the attached short pockets with my phone/wallet helped a little, but not entirely. For that reason, although I was decently happy with the length of the dress (I was worried it would be too short as shorter dresses often are on me), I wish the dress and shorts were an inch or two longer. I think in the future for days with lots of walking/exploring I will wear an extra pair of biker shorts over the top of the attached romper shorts in this dress for added inner thigh protection.  It’s also a teeny bit awkward getting to the mouths of the included pockets under the dress (despite the shorts), especially for frequently-accessed things like my phone or wallet, so I try to keep less frequently-needed items there.  I docked a star for the discomfort d/t chest and thighs, but all in all, I HIGHLY recommend this dress, and those close to me know that I have been raving about it non-stop lol. Big bobbie and leggie approved!  TW: here are my measurements (I ordered a Large in black and I believe it was spot-on): - Chest: 36DD, 39” - Underbust: 33” - Waist: 31” - Hips: 38” - Around the bum: 42”",90

Pull the shorts to the side to pee through the leg and get over it. It’s tight fitting and acts as a body suit. The conjunction of the bra and under garment work together to keep you tucked in and join at a sports bra line under the boob. I removed the pads although they did help to push up but I tossed them and replaced them with cakes I wasn’t looking for that I was going for casual and comfy in the summer heat. They did help the girls though but again wasn’t going for that. Not a real fan of the aesthetics of the adjustable back straps and that’s my only complaint. Looks kinda like you crossed the two straps yourself from the back. Was hoping for a brighter dark teal and it came as navy which matched my eyes and worked out I guess. Would highly recommend aside from the minor personal opinions! High quality likely not an easily snagged material and I am pretty rough with clothing. Hopefully they come out with other colors and improve the cross in the back!",2

I ended up ordering this with the idea that I could return it if it didn’t work so “let’s just see what happens”. LOVE this. Very flattering even with a pooch. The built in shorts, bra and padding are top notch. Smooths everything out and holds things in. I got my regular size large (seriously considered XL though). The large is snug but not in a bad way. Hugs all the right places. The length hits right at my upper thigh which I wouldn’t care for if this was a skirt or dress but the shorts underneath give me confidence that I’m not going to be giving anyone a show.

The length is better than my OV exercise dress but it’s still a bit short for my preference. Hits just a little under the booty on me but still covers. The dress is also a little big but if I size down it would definitely be too short. Fits well enough & can’t beat the price for the quality. Keeping it!,10

So easy to throw on for around the house or paired with a flannel or denim jacket for running errands. I could see how it would work well for sports, I’ve just never used it for that 😅 Overall I highly recommend!",
Erika,Little shorter than expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34ESN2HFBP0DC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CZDX67YD,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 9, 2023",Team Name: ClassicSize: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Great stretch, good quality dress. It fit well, but will return because it was shorter than I expected. The dress covers the built in shorts, but barely. And the shorts end at the bottom of your butt cheeks. So the dress is only a couple inches past that point. I also ordered Old Navy’s Powersoft dress with built in shorts and bra. That one hit more mid thigh for me, and I prefer that length.",9

Well this dress is it!! I had a XL in the past and wearing it threw out my pregnancy I ended up stretching it out bad . So I went and bought a medium in hopes I would eventually fit into it. But to my surprise I fit in it and it makes me feel amazing .",11

I love the pockets and the fact that it has built in shorts, so theres no lines showing under the dress. I would wear underwear that doesn't show seams to keep it that way. The fact that it's like a romper underneath the dress is nice because it keeps your tummy tucked in. It has padding in the breast area so no bra is needed. I am 5'2 weighing 169-170 pounds and i fit a medium perfectly!",4

I love this dress… the pockets are always a plus. The fit is awesome. I am 5’9 and about 200 lbs with a curvy/thick  figure. Got an XL and it is very comfortable without being too tight or loose, just right.  Wanting to buy more in other colors but would love for the maker to add a back cutout feature (below the skirt where the shorts meet) for easy potty usage.",5

I swear I wore it all summer. I work out in it. I wear it to the grocery store. I even wore it while 9 months pregnant because it had such a stretchy material. It fits like a glove and the top layer hides my belly. I have it in two colors! It feels light weight. 135 lbs and I wear a medium.,
