Beauty Expert,True to size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JB37KR9BGNT8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1JVFG37,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 17, 2024",Size: LargeColor: White,,This is a cute workout top. It’s similar to others I have had. I like it and it fits true to size. I wear a size 8 and the medium is perfect on me. Not too tight and a good length. It washed well too. The quality is decent and I would feel good paying $12-$15 for it.,
MountainMama,Super soft pleated back workout shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LTJ18Q5Q7VQ6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1JVFG37,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 10, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Army Green,,"I love the modal fabric of this shirt, it’s so soft and luxuriously comfortable. The design is great, but as for being “long”, it’s really not all that long in the torso. I’m 5’7”, so I’m not much taller than average, and the front hemline is a couple inches shorter than my everyday t-shirts. While the back hemline is longer than the front, it just barely covers my “backside”. So I don’t agree with the “long” description, but I do love everything else about this top. The material is lovely, the olive green color is nice, and it’s lightweight yet not see through. Maybe for shorter people, this could be considered “long”, in the back, but for average to taller people, it’s a normal length shirt.",
Desiree S,Great Shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BMLNQWH6EHXE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1JVFG37,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 8, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Army Green,,"Love this shirt, true to size, fits well, soft fabric, and look flattering",

At $17.99, it's a steal considering its quality and versatility. The loose fit is flattering, and the fabric feels soft against the skin, making it ideal for days when I want to work out without revealing too much. It moves seamlessly with my body during yoga flows, providing both comfort and style. Overall, it's a great investment for anyone seeking a modest yet functional yoga top.",
Jean,Seems to run small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OGJH48X678ON/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1JVFG37,"2.0 "," the United States "," May 27, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,Need to return.

Ashley C,Super nice! Runs a little small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B8KIQ7SKQPMR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1JVFG37,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 17, 2024",Size: MediumColor: White,,"I really thought this was going to be see-through when I pulled it out. It's crazy lightweight and soft, but the material is really thin and I thought that would be an issue with the white shirt. I was wrong! It is a fabric that shows the outline of the sports bra I wear underneath, but just the shape of it, not any colors. I wore it with a bright orange bra, and I couldn't see any orange through it at all!  It shows sweat a LITTLE bit, but not bad. It's very, very comfortable. My only real ""gripe"" is the sizing. I got a medium, but I really wish I had sized up. It's pretty tight around my hips and likes to ride up a bit because of it. It's also a little tight on the arms. Besides that, I love this shirt!",
Music I like,Soft and comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSI03G1A5FXZE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1JVFG37,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 15, 2024",,,I love the material this is made from! It's cool and soft and comfortable to wear. A little thin but for the comfort it doesn't bother me. Runs perfectly true to size so easy to pick the right one. I might need to get a few more in different colors.,
Amazon Customer,very comfy and moves well.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QS7QJ199FNGV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1JVFG37,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 12, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Red,,"The fabric for this top is very flowy, and not only works great as a yoga/work out top, but it is also very attractive and will work with jeans or a skirt.  It is true to size, fits very comfortably, and breathes well.  The fabric has a soft feel to it, and it moisture wicks great.  I am happy with it, and I recommend it.",
Jackie-the-Greyhound,"This is a nice, lightweight athletic type of material.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O7HAUFPANZME/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1JVFG37,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 11, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Army Green,,"I have a longer torso so my bum wasn't quite covered, but the drape was super flattering and hid my middle age tummy but still followed the curves that should be followed.  Snug in the sleeves because my arms have actual muscle, but it looks good.  Like another recent vine item, I just bought another one.  Definitely recommended!",
JreaderLee,Easy to move in,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OH1H8YVHJXT5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1JVFG37,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 9, 2024",,,"This workout top is great for the gym.  It is so lightweight and easy to move in.  After working up a sweat, once done with my workout the top dried in minutes.  I even have a cooling cloth I wear around my neck and the water from the cooling cloth didn't make the front of the top wet like other tops I've worn, so that was an added plus.  This is going to become a regular top to wear to the gym or even if outside on hot days to help keep me cool.  The sizing was perfect, not tight or loose.",
