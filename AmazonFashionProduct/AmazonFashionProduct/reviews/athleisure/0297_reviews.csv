They apologized for me not being happy and had some options to correct what I wasn’t satisfied with. I chose to order a different jacket from them. Though I will say the product wasn’t 5 stars the customer service was 10 stars! They seriously went out of their way to make sure I was happy. I order the fleece zip up and the sleeves were a little stretched at the ends it was still a better product than the original. It’s very refreshing to have a company care about my review/satisfaction with product. Very happy with customer service cannot stress that enough. Thank you Hibelle ❤️  The neck part is seriously bigger than the waist. It’s really not worth the price I’d advise to look elsewhere. Cheap fabric and very poorly made does NOT look like the photo.,28

Extremely soft on the inside and has a lot of stretch. I probably could have gotten one size up but I’m happy with it. The way the hood is sewn is a little strange to me and it’s tighter at the hips than it is at the top for some reason. I don’t normally zip it though so that’s not really an issue for me. I just have it as a light jacket for work and for what I paid for it I’m not too disappointed. 🤷🏻‍♀️,
