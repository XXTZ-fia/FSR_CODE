Very cute, I'm happy with my purchase. Perfect for weekends running errands or a comfortable outfit for traveling. Affordable alternative to the Sp@nx A!r Essenti@ls track suit.",4

It was packaged nicely. Nice construction but there were a couple of loose threads.  The material was soft and felt nice. I loved the way the blocks of white lined up from the jacket to the pants.  I ordered a XXL. I am not used to short jackets but this fit perfectly and was very comfortable. It came right to my waist. The pants were more of a 3X-4X. The waist was a little loose but doable, but the wide legs were too too wide and they were about 4 inches too long, I’m 5’7”.  Sadly I had to return the set, I was heart broken. I hope it works for you it was a great deal and a beautiful design.",28

It had just a touch of a smell to it, but my concern was the heavy deep heat press marks that were on it. Thankfully, I was able to wash them out and the outfit looks fine now, but that would cause a problem if I were to gift this. It’s a beautiful outfit and so comfortable on just keep an eye out for that specific issue. If it wasn’t for that, I would give this a perfect review because it feels wonderful on, washes well, can be versatile as you can definitely layer underneath it and the dupe look it has is spot on.

Again, for the price, I’ll deal with it. I do with the jacket had pockets. The color is perfect. It isn’t too warm, I think it will be good year round. I plan to wear it for a couple of trips I have coming up, it will be good for the airports and daytime adventures. Buyer beware though. It really smells when you first open the package. I washed it two times right away to take care of that issue, but still. It was not ideal.",2

I do not like the ankle look on any of my pants, so I ordered a small & med to compare lengths. I'm 5'7"" and 152lbs....while the length on the med was better ( it grazed the floor) it was too big overall. With that said, I will have to wear the small size pants at a low waist ( under bellybutton ) to get the same length affect as the med. But, overall you should love the sweatsuit.",
