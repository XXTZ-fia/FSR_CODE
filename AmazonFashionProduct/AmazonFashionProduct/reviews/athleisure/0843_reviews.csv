I was correct about the material being a bit thin, but since the sizing runs a bit smaller, wearing it over another top makes it bulky looking. I would not call this a sweatshirt, as it is not very thick material or particularly warm, although it would work well enough in Autumn or Spring without a coat. Though the material is soft enough, it has that polyester feel to it that I'm not fond of against my skin, so I will try it out with a thin cotton undershirt and see if I like that better. If you're not particular about the feel of certain fabrics, then this top will be fine for you.",4
