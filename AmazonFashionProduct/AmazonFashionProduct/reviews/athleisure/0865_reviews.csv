To make them even better, they’re flattering especially on shorter frames. My 26” inseam legs look long and long in these babies! I’m way happy with them and am anticipating which color to buy next. A Carhartt brown would be a nice color to make; hint, hint… ;)",2

I hate wearing shorts but I live in FL so getting dressed during the hot months is especially challenging. These shorts are really comfortable. They wash well too - delicate cycle, low heat and didn’t shrink much (if at all). I sized up one size so they were baggy but if you want them to hit closer to your body, I think they run TTS. (For reference, I’m 5’3”, 145lbs, pear shaped size 4/6 curvy in pants and I prefer the Large in these). Overall a great buy! I have at least 4 colors now.",3

To me, they scream lounge:  These feel like something I’d put on at the end of the day in that weird in-between time before bed, or maybe on a lazy Sunday.  You can definitely wear them in a casual athleisure look without looking *too* too sloppy.Shorts are solid quality and the fabric has some weight to it.  These are made of a sweatshirt-type material—a medium-weight cotton-like fabric that I would not want to sweat in. (They aren’t breathable and there is no liner, so I wouldn’t workout in them.  But those aspects make them good for lounge for me.)  A pocket on each side, wide elastic waistband, and volley-style hem.  The inseam is about 2” *but* they do hang longer and cover more than that in the way they comfortably fall on me, which is the waistband at or just below my natural waist.  I could hike them up all the way to my bra if I wanted the actual 2” length…but that’s not comfortable and would look silly.Drawstring works but note—they are not super tight anywhere.  I suppose I could cinch up the drawstring, but then I’d have an unusually long string hanging on the front.  I got my true size (XS, 5’3”, 110lb) and they work…a bit loose, but that works for my lounge purposes.  If you want a tighter fit, size down.Overall good for my purpose!  One star down just for the slightly extra loose fit and slightly odd length/extra fabric around the crotch.",2
