Nadine,Runs large but gives that edgy slouchy look.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2W1GTW14CDD36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CC5J8JFZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 4, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"This waffle sweater is very comfortable, and when I first tried it on  it appeared way too big, so I ordered another style and down a size which arrived today. It had a perfect fit but I wanted slouchy so I put this larger one on; rolled the sleeves up and played with the neckline. Perfect Perfect Perfect. So I will be keeping this one and will return my second choice. Pros is this waffle sweater is very lightweight and comfortable. Dress it down or throw on some fancy jewelry and dress it up!",5

SS,So comfy & cute! Quite oversized…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CDWWA4BCO6TG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CC5J8JFZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 7, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Green 504,Verified Purchase,I am 5’4 and 140 lbs. I ordered the color Green504 in a Small and love how it fits! Sweater is comfy and a little oversized. Can be worn off the shoulder a bit as seen in pictures if wanted but also stays put if you prefer not to. The fabric is what I’d consider medium weight in thickness. Definitely won’t keep you warm if worn alone outside in colder temps but did keep me comfortable (but not hot) inside at work where the halls are freezing and the temperature fluctuates from hot to cold from room to room. (I work in a junior high school) I tend to run hot and never felt overheated while wearing and running around the building with my busy schedule accompanying students with special needs to their classes. It’s currently the beginning of November in Arkansas and about 60 degrees outside during the day. I wore the shirt without a coat or extra layer and was quite comfortable. Very happy with my purchase! I’ve only worn it once but seems as though it will hold up in regard to wear and tear. I hope this helps! :-),16

I did see this in a review from someone else but I wish I would not have bought it. Also the color is not right and has fading in spots all over the shirt. overall I will not buy another one. Do not recommend by putting it in the dryer to make smaller it’s will shrink and be shorter and the fabric is also way too thin. Shirt is very poorly  made . Disappointed!,

It is oversized and comfy. However, the neck is really wide but not wide enough for the off the shoulder look. The real problem is the color! I didn’t realize (since it’s not really shown in the stock photos) that it’s splotchy! It almost looks defective and there was an error being made or even that a bunch of bleach or something got on it in the wash. I looked at reviews and someone else had the same complaint. So just know that’s what you’re getting and it’s not a “washed” look and more of a bleached/defective look. I’ll return it bc I think I would get looks if I wore it out",16
