I'm 5'6"" and 225 lbs, I ordered the 3x and they are long but I wear heals all the time so they are perfect.  I have a bubble butt and it's so hard to find pants other than Yoga pants to dress up with heals and pretty tops. I usually get flare leg with yoga pants but I'm self conscious about my thick knees and they are injured so swollen most the time and these pants hang very soft over my knees and I still feel cool and hip with the bottom being very wide (feels like bell bottoms still)  Love them.  Very soft, still has the yoga sleekness, NOT Cotton so your long shirt sticks on top of my back end shelf... lol  5 Star for sure.  Oh, and the pockets don't bulge even being thick and they are sewn in so they don't bunch up unless you put your hands in and flatten them.  the pockets lay flat real nice.",7

Dan,Almost exactly the lounge pants I've been looking for!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OHUXM1O1A7UJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHS9SZQZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 28, 2020",,Verified Purchase,"I've been searching for a specific pair of lounge pants for the last few months (hello, quarantine!). I want a pair that does not look like pajamas, is comfortable, and not really compressive like workout pants. Joggers are not flattering on me, and I want something lighter than sweatpants. I prefer pockets so I can keep track of my phone while I'm working around the house. I don't want to look sloppy in case I need to run out to get the mail or if someone unexpectedly comes to the door. I'm also 5'2"" so they can't been too long (though I could fix that with a hem). It's quite a tall order, I know. When I saw these pants I read the details and a bunch of reviews, and decided to give them a try since the price is right. Overall, I'm quite pleased! I was worried about the length, since I am short and some reviewers said they were long. However, they are much higher waisted than expected. Wearing them higher waisted the hem is actually exactly where I wanted it! That being said, they are quite high waisted. Probably higher than I would've liked. At first they looked like they were going to be way too small, but since they come up so high they fit fine. They're a little unforgiving (pantylines!), but again, they are mainly for lounging. Size wise, if I order another pair I'll probably get the medium so they are a bit looser in the waist and bum. I'm usually a 2 or 4, or small, depending on the brand. The material is super soft! Its a good weight without being too heavy. And the pockets are good sized, both the front pockets and rear pockets. I wasn't sure if either were fake pockets, which would've been super annoying, but they are all functional. Overall I'm very happy, and would recommend them. Though I would caution about sizing that you might want to size up.",15

Good quality construction with nice size pockets. I like wearing these for lounging or a nicer athleisure style for running errands. Definitely versatile style pant. They’re not see through at all (I got the black),
