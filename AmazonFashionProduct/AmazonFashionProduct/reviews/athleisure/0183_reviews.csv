Alexis Register,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Super Comfy Joggers with Pockets!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NIODR2GLWA0B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJYZXWYL,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 10, 2024",Special Size: StandardSize: X-LargeColor: Set 6,Verified Purchase,"I'm absolutely in love with this three-pack of women's joggers. They are incredibly comfortable, and the fit at the waist is just right. I often struggle with joggers that are too tight or too loose around the waist, but these have an elastic waistband with a drawstring that allows for easy adjustment. They sit comfortably without feeling restrictive.  The fact that they come in a three-pack is fantastic—I have multiple colors to choose from, so there's always a pair that goes with whatever I'm wearing. These joggers also have pockets, which is a huge plus! I can keep my phone, keys, or small essentials with me without having to carry a bag everywhere.  I wear them for just about everything. They're perfect for everyday wear, whether I'm running errands, lounging around the house, or hitting the gym. The fabric is soft and breathable, making them ideal for any activity. They hold up well in the wash, and the colors don't fade, which is great because I've been wearing them almost daily!  Overall, this three-pack of joggers is a fantastic buy. The comfort, fit, and versatility make them a must-have for anyone who wants stylish and functional joggers for multiple occasions. I highly recommend them!",12

The colors are vibrant and do not seem to fade after wash. No shrinkage. I weigh 145lbs, they are form fitting but not super tight, I ordered a medium. They are a little long but not terribly, I'm 5'3. My only issue with these pants is the pink pair came stained from being packaged against the black pair. I think it can be washed out. I won't be returning them because I typically don't. If they remain stained I'll use them around the house. They might want to think of placing tissue between the pants to avoid this.",3
Lex,"Thinner than I'd like, stitching issue with a pair, overall ok, would buy again a size down",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSZU2H4A85I4N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJYZXWYL,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Special Size: StandardSize: XX-LargeColor: Set 7,Verified Purchase,So let me start off by saying I do love these.. I definitely recommend going down a size from the usual wear as these are very thin.. thinner than normal leggings (so they look a little funny with any room) the stitching on one pair is falling apart after wearing them once only for a few hours. The pockets are HUGE which I absolutely love because I can never fit anything in my pockets but could legit fit a Stanley cup in these. They're very comfortable and they look okay.,

GEM,Unmatched Excellence!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9WDVD6Y801HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJYZXWYL,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 5, 2024",Special Size: StandardSize: MediumColor: Set 8,Verified Purchase,"I needed lightweight full length leggings for blocking the sun during hot weather runs.  I also use these for cool weather runs.  They serve both purposes perfectly!  They are lightweight, breathable, and the waistband never budges, which is unprecedented for leggings.  They have a pants vibe but don't balloon out into harem pants like most joggers do. The ankles also never budge. The look is sleek without being tights.  The best quality, however is the length.  I tried jogger after jogger which left a huge gap at the ankle, or the ankles would ride up, causing a gap.  I am 5' 8 1/2"" and these are the perfect length - never too short.  The pockets are nice and flat and don't have that pocket material on the thigh adding bulk.  I have already purchased multiple packs and will never go back to tights!  Incredible value!",

They’re soft and stretchable. Nice variety of colors, it would be nice not to have black in all their bundles of three. We thought they had a draw strap on the waist, but they don’t. She says they don’t need them anyway. She wears them with the legs all the way down or capri style. We ordered true size and they fit good. She says they’re very comfortable. The material is not thick, but it’s not thin either, feels like a good quality fabric. Looks like a good job on the stitching also. Real Essentials always puts out a good product.",
Jonathan E. Kiser,High waistband is Misleading!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XW6T4FD3V834/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJYZXWYL,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 21, 2024",Special Size: StandardSize: X-LargeColor: Set 9,Verified Purchase,"I purchased these for my wife and although they are pictured to have a high, thick waistband, they do not!  The full waistband is high up but the elastic is only actually a small fraction of the full waistband.  She considered sizing up to XXL (and wish she did) as the elastic cuts right into her belly so she wears them mostly around her hips (here at home) in hopes that they eventually stretch out some.  We do love the colors and the fabric is nice & smooth though.Also, the pockets & phone shown are just like hers and it would be nice if the pockets were a bit bigger as she has an iPhone & it sticks out some making it easily droppable.",

Colors are beautiful, material is soft and stretchy and very comfortable. I like a loose fit in joggers, got a standard small and they fit me perfectly - I'm 5'5, 108 lbs. A pack of 3 for $40(ish) puts each pair around $13. DEAL!!! I will say that I'm a bit concerned about how they'll wash because the darker colored pair packed next to the lighter colored pair in shipping actually rubbed off a little, darker onto lighter, see pic... I feel like that will wash off the peach colored pants BUT I'll definitely wash the darker pairs very carefully for a while, to keep them from ruining anything washed with them. I may try to update the review after I've had them for a while, but at this point I'll definitely buy more because the fit and feel and colors and price are all together awesome UPDATE 06/2024: These are still some of the best joggers I've had. I didn't notice any issues washing, they don't attract lint, the waist band is super comfy, no shrinkage anywhere. I love these for real. I'll keep the 4 stars just because of the color transfer onto the peach pair during shipping. That never came out. Hopefully they're packing them better now",27
