Adrienne,Better than expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33A7O57YF7H3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08FT5DLGM,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 3, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Khaki Leopard,Verified Purchase,"I’m 5’3, 135 lbs, 36A cup, I notoriously wear a large in sport bras and anything that has a built in bra. However, I ordered this in a medium (and I never do this so I  immediately tried to change to a large but it was too late lol) after looking at reviews to make it more form fitting and the medium actually did turn out to be  perfect. Like others reviewers mentioned, this khaki leopard color is more like a brown leopard. Still cute, but darker. The quality is made really well, you can see that there are seams that reinforce the fabric so it lasts long. The torso area is comfy because there’s a little bit of room. The fit looks beautiful and I want to buy more. I can tell this won’t shrink. However, it is a little tight in the cup area even for my little A’s lol. larger cups beware…you could maybe feel too squished.",5
Tenaya Welts,perfect tank top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Y5LX2MRTCTVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08FT5DLGM,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 10, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: A Heart Black,Verified Purchase,This is exactly what I have been looking for.

Jea,This bra actually supports the bigger boobs.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VGKP3HMEYSHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08FT5DLGM,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 27, 2022",Size: XX-LargeColor: Navy Blue,Verified Purchase,"I'm 66, small framed but big breasted naturally so they are no longer where they should be.  Getting support without being 'strapped in' is almost non existent.  Over the past couple of years, I've tried every bra out there that isn't an underwire or having a back closure. NONE have worked.  Wearing a bra was the equivalent of wearing a tank under my clothes.  UNTIL I found this bra!!!  It's not only extremely comfortable, feels as if I'm not wearing a bra, but it actually has good support, not perfect but definitely supportive, and is even attractive.  Yes, it can be worn as a tank.  The only flaw I found is that the sides cut in under the arms so there's not full coverage for spillage.  I'll live with it.  And yes as others have said, the fabric is similar to that of a bathing suit. I have a 43"" chest, am 5'3"" and weigh 145 lbs and ordered the 44.  It fits perfectly.  Not tight and not loose and just right with the right amount of support.  The only other flaw is that it doesn't seem to come in enough neutral solid colors, lots of prints that I'm not sure would be seen through tops.  I can't attest to longevity as I just got them. I highly recommend!!",7

tbyg,The band is a big issue.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MCZXBR1GKGGX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08FT5DLGM,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 17, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Heart Floral Leaf White,Verified Purchase,"Literally and figuratively. I first ordered an extra large, which fit beautifully everywhere except for the band of the bra portion. It was so loose my boobs kept falling out the bottom. It was so very loose that I returned it and reordered a medium. Well, the band on this one is tight enough, but everything else is way tighter as well. I couldn't maneuver into it over my head so I had to put it on by stepping into it. That is not a big deal, but the way it gave me a bunch of cleavage I didn't really want and fit tightly enough everywhere that I'm not sure I can do yoga in it, which is what I bought it for, is a fair sized issue. I can't decide whether to keep this one, and the other in a different pattern that I noticed was only available in medium so I got it too, or return them for a large. I'm really doubtful the large would have a tight enough band, because the band on the medium is just barely tight enough. If I wanted to spend the money, I would reorder an extra large and have the band taken in. It's cute enough that I'm actually considering that. Darn that band, though.  Edited to add that the band on the large was more too large than the band on the medium, as I expected. I am in fact keeping the extra large and having my seamstress do something about the bra band, because it is just too cute. But they really need to reconsider their sizing on the bra band. Just the bra band",4
Darla,YOU CAN STOP THE ROLL UP,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R9TEBPYM7KXR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08FT5DLGM,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 30, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black Scoop Neck,Verified Purchase,I love these shelf bra tops. So comfortable lots of stretch too but like others have said..it rolled at the bottom driving me crazy I HATED it doing that but it still was comfy to wear only having to constantly pull it down begin to bother me more. So I thought to myself..self 🤔 hmm you really love this top and you wear it a lot (as a bra) mostly under my shirts. What can be done to STOP the roll up? Then it came to me..ELASTIC IN THE BOTTOM! I was afraid at first of ruining this but happy it didn't stop me from trying because ladies guess what? It WORKED! All you need to do is cut two small slits on the bottom of the top either in front or back . Make sure you don't cut through just on the top level of the material. Like you see how sweat pants with a draw string is? Like that. Measure the amount of elastic you need by wrapping it around your ribs then pull it a little snug and cut the elastic. Get a safety pin and attach it to one end of the elastic and start threading it through. After that sew the two ends together and walla! Your top will not budge! Hope this helps some of you who have the problem with it rolling up. Make sure you cut your elastic as thin as the bottom of the bra so it will go through the slits. Also if you want try a draw string and tie it. I'd think that would work too but if not.. elastic will. Have a Blessed day 💖,8

Going to alter the large instead of returning. I love these tops for working out or just wearing. Bought a medium in this brand and it is smaller then the gym ppl med so that's frustrating.,3

Fitnlovinit,True to size. I’m a true medium. 8-10 in lululemon,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JZUSTVEVFOLP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08FT5DLGM,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 23, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I ordered this in medium because large was sold out. The material I prefer more for workout than the lululemon align tank because the straps don’t fall off my shoulders as easily and it’s more of a workout material. I have like 20 align tanks, so it tells you something if I love this one. I have lat muscles so I often order a 10 in Lulu but I can wear an 8 (the shelf bra is smaller and it isn’t as appealing on the lat fat). This fits in between an 8 and 10 from Lululemon for me because it doesn’t squeeze and fits my 36c comfortably. The band doesn’t ride up and the material is soft. I did order from a few other brands on Amazon and sizing is not comparable between brands. Haha I had to try large and return a few. Medium fits good and I’m curious to see if large would be even better or too big.",11

I was right on the cusp of the sizing but I decided to give it a try.  This is very snug if you are at the larger size of the 2X.  It still fit though and provides nice support on my chest area.  The bottom does not stay put and rides up though.I am not taking off a star for that as it is sizing and not the bra itself.This is like a bathing suit top.  It feels exactly like the material for one and I just do not like that.  It is very stretchy and even has a lining like a suit would have.  I just did not like that when I was working out.Otherwise, this is ok.  I would like to see them carry a little larger size.  I will wear it, but it is not like others I have tried for wearing for my workouts.  I would pass on this if you are close to the end of the sizing as well.",

I even like the fabric that comes down underneath the bra so you can wear it as a cami if you need to throw a dress shirt on and run.  What I don’t like- it may be ME not the bra.  The extra fabric underneath the bra does roll up and so unless you’re wearing it alone you have to constantly adjust it.  I was disappointed that the pads on the bra weren’t sewn in… and have to be readjusted. It isn’t a no buy again problem but it would make it more user friendly, as they do come out in the wash.

Here is why: I'm 5'3 135 lbs and wear a 32DD/34D bra.  According to the chart a 32DD should get size Medium. But a 34D should get size Large. Most women know that 32DD and 34D are 'sister' sizes.  So in theory, they should both be the same size tank.  This is why I say sizing is a littler weird. They had me in two different sizes. So I ordered the Medium, because my true bra size is 32DD and all my other workout tops are medium.  This Medium turned out to be a bit too tight in the chest. So in hindsight I should have gone with the Large. I hope this helps other chesty ladies decide which size to choose.",16

I’ll admit I do have some small spillage on the top (I got a size Large) however, if I got an XL I don’t think I would’ve had as good compression that I do with the size Large. The pads inside are helpful, but I personally remove them. The material of the bra is super comfortable and smooth, it’s my favorite aspect of the bra! I wouldn’t run in this bra necessarily, but as a larger chested woman I have that problem with almost every bra anyways lol.  Overall, it gives good compression and coverage! I think they are really flattering and cute as well! I can update this review once I do a couple of workouts in them too. But from what I feel about them so far, I’ll most likely get more colors!

P,Great for average proportions,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JSBHZVN5NB4H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08FT5DLGM,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 12, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Heart Blue,Verified Purchase,Cyclist. 32H. Post spinning photos. This sports bra is very comfortable and I was able to complete my workout without incident. I had some overflow from the top at first but they settled in well enough. It's very difficult to find a small band large cup sports bra so I have to use a band that doesn't fit properly and therefore I often slip out of the bottom. Overall I'm pleasantly surprised but I will continue my search for a better sports bra for my body.,26
Brittany,So comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R261STN3ICH5KY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08FT5DLGM,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 27, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Heart Black Carbon,Verified Purchase,"I bought 3 of these in my order,  the tie-dye green, the black tie-dye and marble looking one. They all fit the same, they’re comfortable and has good support when I wore them during Zumba. With high waisted leggings there’s only a small showing of the stomach area with these cropped tops. I bought these out of comfort zone, so I often keep pulling it down when it rolls a bit to where it should be sitting but it’s not necessary and doesn’t roll up any higher. Once I get more comfortable wearing these out in public I wouldn’t feel the need to keep pulling it",
