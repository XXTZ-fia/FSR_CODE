It’s not the highest quality, but it’s cute and flattering. I like how its tucked in a bit at the waist so it gives you a nice silhouette. The material is very lightweight, so that’s nice. The only thing I dislike is how the thumb hole is constructed. They put the thumb hole along the seam of the arm, which is placed on the underside of your arm. So it naturally wants to go away from where your thumb is, it’s just a bit odd. Also the thumb hole is kind of huge and the seams there are bulky, so it’s a little irritating, especially since the hole is constantly being pulled down to where the seam is actually supposed to be. I’d prefer the thumb hole to be a bit more comfortable and naturally placed.  If you are between sizes, definitely size down. It runs a little big.",19

I do wish they offered a XXL as I think that would fit a little more comfortable for me. If you tend to Be between an XL and XXL for most tops I would not recommend unless your okay with a tighter fit.,

I am very large busted and I have broad shoulders and bigger upper arms but a very small waist so I am a little odd when it comes to trying to fit shirts. For me being 5 foot eight and 164 pounds with size D chest I would probably tell you to go to a large instead of the medium. But the arms are actually a very nice length because I have long arms and I have no problem putting my thumbs in the little farm holes and not feeling like they’re creeping up my wrists or anything. It’s a nicely constructed shirt if you have normal to narrow shoulders you’re golden.,3

It was very tight. So I'm not sure if the other are normal for a size S or if they were sewn differently than the gray one. The material is super soft and stretchy. Overall I love them.

Works for a gentle yoga but probably would be annoying after awhile in more active or inverted poses.  Good weight for this type of fabric. Color accurate to online  photo.  The thumb holes are a bit “overdone” and not as discreet as I like when I am not using them.  But for sun coverage I think the top will be excellent.  I did not give five stars due to the thumb holes.  Four and a three-quarters is more like it.,
