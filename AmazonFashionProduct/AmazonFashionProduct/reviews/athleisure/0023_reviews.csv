Jerry B,Stylish and Comfortable Lightweight Joggers,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2B5HPCJS3E0JR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C6V2T8H9,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 22, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I purchased the Lightweight Workout Joggers for my daughter as part of her cheer uniform to wear when the team isn’t performing. These joggers have been a fantastic addition to her wardrobe! The fit was exactly as expected, ensuring comfort and ease of movement, which is crucial for an active cheerleader.  The joggers look tremendous and wear wonderfully, maintaining their quality even after multiple uses. The material is lightweight yet durable, offering breathability without compromising on sturdiness. My daughter loves how stylish they are. They seamlessly blend into her cheer attire while providing a practical option for non-performance times.  Overall, these joggers have exceeded our expectations in both function and style. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for comfortable, well-fitting workout pants suitable for various activities.",

I wore them out to a toddler play date, and they are easy to move around in and stretch. I can squat down, and my bottom doesn't fall out. There's an option to tie the waist tighter as well. I think the style is cute for every day errands, and casual settings. The material isn't too thick or too thin, and felt very comfortable under the kansas sun on a 75⁰ day. The material is pretty wrinkle resistant, as I've noticed they only show for a short period of time.",4

I decided to give these a go before spending $100 dollars on the others and I’m glad I did! The fabric is nearly exactly the same. I haven’t washed them yet so cannot comment on how they hold up, but I have leggings from crz yoga that have lasted years. I am 5’6 ~ 145-150 and a true size medium. I purchased the medium and they fit nice but are a slim fit - so if you’re looking for oversized, size up! I purchased in black and they will make for a great casual pant. Will probably order in another color. Highly recommend!",

They look exactly the same as lulu but are HIGH waisted so they fit me correctly and do not give me camel toe. I haven’t washed them or worn them yet so cannot speak to how well they will hold up. But I’d imagine they’d last at least through one winter of wearing every week. They seem to be made very well. For the price you can’t beat it. The only down side is the fabric isn’t as nice as lulu which makes sense. But we are taking very minor differences. You need to buy these. The medium fits like a size 8.,8

This is upsetting because XL is the largest size they carry and I’m not a “fat” person, just muscular with a large back and broad shoulders and hips.  I recommend you buy these based on the size guide not what you wear in other brands. I have a 33” waist and 45” hips and usually wear a large/12/32 in bottoms.  These I would wear casually, for running, or upper body days.

Kirsty,Lovely joggers,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17QGCP0O41X8T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C6V2T8H9,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 20, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Mauve,Verified Purchase,"Just got these in the mail. Fit perfectly. Sizing wise. True to size. I’m 5’4 and 145/150 weight range and small and longer length option is perfect!  However, the packaging was ripped open and they smell like chemical/strong laundry detergent. Suspect they may be a return so will return these and order again in hopes of a fresh pair.  Update - Reorder arrived in perfect condition. Love them! May order another pair in black in XS. They stretch just a little after wearing. Highly recommend. Great lululemon dupe!",2

I do wish I got a small, I am 5’5” and about 138lbs. Medium will be good with I have my winter coat back on. Buy then.",3
