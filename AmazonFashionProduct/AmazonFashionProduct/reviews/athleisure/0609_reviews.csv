Lesley Jackson,Perfect for my trip!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27CLO7ZZFS3V4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CVVT1PW9,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Color: RoyalblueSize: Small,Verified Purchase,This 2 piece outfit was comfortable and fit perfectly. It was perfect for my trip to Brasil! It even matched my Teva sandals pretty closely. Also the material was pretty good quality.,
Sona E.,Love it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHN1918PQIA3H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CVVT1PW9,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 5, 2024",Color: LightgreySize: Small,Verified Purchase,The set is great for summertime. The length of the shorts were perfect as it was neither too short or long. The top came just above the shorts and wasn’t too cropped. The material is thick enough to not be see through but breathable and comfortable for summertime. Good quality material. Did not shrink in the wash. Good value.,

Extra: This outfit I plan on mixing the top with different shorts, but if I wore it as one it would be only at home. Maybe during cleaning the house or outside chores. The waist band looks better folded (as suggested on a video made in the reviews), but then the shorts go from a nice length to booty shorts.",

Vieth,Flattering for a curvier types,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP4GSJ67C9MUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CVVT1PW9,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 21, 2024",Color: CoffeeSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"Love this set, & will be ordering more. Soft waffle knot fabric with a thicker waste line & length of shorts are not bootie length. They are long enough that my thighs don’t rub together. Also love the strong waistband tie & pockets. The top also isn’t too baring & just a peak of skin is exposed. T back bra will work the best but also since the material is waffle print it gives more coverage than just a cotton top",

My only gripe is the tag on the top being an itchy nuisance. I even cut it out thinking that would help but it didn’t. But it’s not something that would deter me from wearing it. I’ve washed and dried on low with no problems of shrinkage, material is not too thick for summer wear, and it’s also not see through. I went up a couple of sizes just based off of other reviews and I enjoyed the extra coverage while not making me look like a whale.

I’m 5’4”, 155 lb, curvy hourglass & typically size 10-12. This was definitely the right size (large), but the shirt gapped at the armpits weirdly.  I also didn’t love that you’d HAVE to wear either a racerback or strapless bra with this.  The shorts were a stretchier fabric with more give than the fabric of the top. The neckline was hard to fit my head through.  I almost kept this set just for the shorts, they’re so comfy.  I hope they update & re-release this with those few changes to the top!",2

I have a more athletic type build and I feel like it accentuated my shoulders in just the right way.
