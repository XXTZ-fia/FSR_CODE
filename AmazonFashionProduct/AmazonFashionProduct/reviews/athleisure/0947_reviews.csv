The added shorts/cloth on the legging is surprisingly comfortable and you really don't notice the shorts immediately - so would be great if someone is a bit self-conscious on their front view in leggings.

It doesn't match the size of the bottoms which surprisingly fit me and I have a large bubble butt. I bought the extra large and the bottoms fit I haven't tried the shorts the bra is very tiny but I can get it on and then both the shirt and the zip up hoodie are also tight. I don't know if I would buy this again because they really need to offer one size larger or redistribute the sizing because it's not consistent between top and bottom. I would say if you have large breasts you probably will not fit into this thing mine are tiny and this is tight. Positives are the bottoms are really nice and the material itself is cozy and the colors are pretty. It seems to be made well as as well,
