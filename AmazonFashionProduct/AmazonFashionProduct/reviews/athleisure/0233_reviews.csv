I’m 5’ 7”, 34DD, and around 165 pounds, so I bought a L.  It gives me an oversized fit so the top covers my bum and I can sort of curl up in it.  The legs are long enough that they touch the ground in bare feet (but not with sneakers), and there’s a drawstring waist to cinch it higher or lower on the waist as you prefer.It’s very light weight/thin but the material lays well.  The 3/4 zip means you can control how much of your neck you want open to the air (and therefore temperature).My only complaint is that the top doesn’t have pockets.  I would have liked side pockets to store my passport as I was moving around the airport but there are pockets in the pants so that’s a minor quibble.",33
