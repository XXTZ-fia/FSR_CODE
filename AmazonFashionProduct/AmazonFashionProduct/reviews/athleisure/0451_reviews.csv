PSW,Comfortable and looks great!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K1MRJBMP8VP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CH82VKDM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Size: X-SmallColor: Fiery Red,Verified Purchase,"Perfect for, comfy, stays put.

Liann,Amazing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PGYWA1P2V56O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CH82VKDM,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 8, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Estate Blue,Verified Purchase,"THESE LEGGINGS ARE AMAZING, I’m very picky with my gym clothes but I gave these a chance and I’m so happy I did!! I’m typically a medium in leggings but went with a small based on reviews and they fit perfectly. They’re super stretchy, so if i gained or lost a bit of weight I’m sure they’d still fit well. The material is thin so if you prefer thicker material then I would maybe consider something else",
Lauren shay,For every positive there is a negative,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ODTMYW0XUORN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CH82VKDM,"3.0 "," the United States "," April 19, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Fiery Red,Verified Purchase,Overall I think I like them. I haven’t actually worn them yet just tried them on upon arrival.  I got the red pair and they came with some kind of black stuff on one side of them. Hopefully that will wash off. The fit is good and the material feels nice and seems to have a good thickness but some how they are still very see through. One of my legs is entirely covered in tattoos as well as my butt cheek on that side and needless to say you can see the whole tattoo through the leggings. I’m only 5’3” and these are very short on me..almost like capris. I’m fine with the capri type length but wasn’t expecting it to be that way. Nice stretch and butt looks good though. So I’m gonna say 3 stars bc there are many unexpected negatives but they are comfortable and still look good o.,5
Meghan,love these leggins,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10LLH3B4P08VN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CH82VKDM,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 22, 2024",Size: X-SmallColor: Fudge Coffee,Verified Purchase,very comfortable and have great stretch. I'm short and I found the length to be perfect. I also love that the scrunch isn't very noticeable. For reference I have 27 inch waist and 40 inch hips and the XS fits perfect. thinking about getting the black as well.,
Kelly Bennett,Love a good scrunch butt on leg day ;),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GQM7RX3VB37R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CH82VKDM,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 9, 2024",Size: X-SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I love these leggings for my workouts!! I wasn’t sure if I’d like how tight they are around the waist but I’ve worn them for a handful of workouts now and I’m a believer now. They are tight, very true to size, I might have been able to get away with a small but I worry that would be a tad too big. I love the scrunch butt and the contour around the booty. I wish they made this version in brighter colors but either way I’m definitely buying more! If you hang dry, they wash just fine without losing shape (washed at least 3-4x now). And they’re just the right amount of thickness (not too much, not too little) to keep everything in place during high intensity workouts or on heavy leg days and also provide a little warmth before I get myself warmed up on these cold Idaho days!",

Theodora A.,Lintproof AND no front seam 😍,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU1JFQDFNY22P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CH82VKDM,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 17, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I’ve tried sooo many pairs of leggings (Lululemon, Athleta, other Amazon brands) but none of them had all the features I wanted. None of them were lintproof and the ones that were had that stupid front seam (how are we still adding that in 2024?!?)  These leggings are thick (not see through), lintproof (especially with fluffy sweaters), make your butt look amazing AND they don’t give you a cameltoe (no front seam). They’re honestly amazing quality for the price. The waistband is also 👌🏻  Get them, I promise you won’t regret it!",
Maya,They roll!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EMH1M95ZFGTH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CH82VKDM,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 10, 2024",,Verified Purchase,These feel so cheap. I mean they are are but i was expecting more. I’ve purchased other leggings from Amazon and I have not felt disappointed like this. The worst part is they roll!,
Amazon Customer,Not as described or pictured (but we all know pics are set up),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BZTDH9O7OL93/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CH82VKDM,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 2, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Bluing,Verified Purchase,"NOT high waisted, I am a trainer and own and buy a lot of workout outfits.  I am a high waisted girl, love the high waisted fit.  These are NOT high waisted, they are considered mid-waisted, hit right below the belly button and no further (maybe if you are a very short torso person, but if you have a longer torso, these wont fit high waisted.  Also, the fabric is a fabric I am not use too, it is a stiffer fabric, with lots of stretch, sort of thick but still see through, the true test is to put your hand inside and stretch the fabric over your finger nails, if you see your finger nails through the pants (and I'm not talking about just an outline, like a pantyline,  the actual color or entire fingernail) then they are see through, for those who say they aren't, not sure you can see your own crack through the pants, if the lighting and angle isn't right.  I've seen A cracks before during hot yoga class, that view is not appealing but someone who can see you at the back angle.  Now I will say, I loved the color and if they were indeed high waisted, although see through, I would have kept them, but not wear to the gym nor do squats, deadlifts or any other workout that required me to bend over in front of people.  I would have worn them out casually, hiking, something of that nature.  I have already processed my return....",

They’re so comfortable, make your butt look good, the waist has great compression, the top doesn’t roll down, and they are the best dupes (BuffBunny) I’ve had!! I do suggest sizing down, as I’m normally a small but they were loose in the front and seems like the fabric could snag easily…. Other than that, great bang for your buck!",

Amazon Customer,Better than aurola leggings- maybe size down,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UUF698CCFW2Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CH82VKDM,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 22, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"These leggings are my new favorite! If you liked aurola leggings, these are even better! The seam for the scrunch is more tight and less stretchy therefore when you pull the leggings up, the seam sits right at the lower and middle part between your glutes making the scrunch seam less noticeable! Super stretchy, usually a medium and the small fit perfect without being too tight!",
