Nikki,My favorite athletic top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGGSYXCKYU2EJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTVHDJTX,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 30, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I am so obsessed with this crop tee!!! I wish I owned 7 of them because I could wear them every single day of the week! Not only does it look amazing, it is perfect for the gym. It has a decent amount of stretch but also really holds you in. You can wear with or without a sports bra underneath. I have worn this out shopping and it looks like just a really cute cropped shirt. I just love it!",
Myca Noelle,fitted but super cute🖤,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WKYB6129ZMUN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTVHDJTX,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 4, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,,i love using this top for casual wear as well as working out. it’s simple and cute so it’s goes with everything my go to when using this top is my jeggings or a skirt. it is fitted but not at all tight you can’t really feel it when wearing. i think if you want a more looser feel size up but if you are fine with it fitted get your regular size. it’s breathable and comfortable to wear. easy to just throw on as well.,
Lily French,Super short,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2M42HQNHLDYYY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTVHDJTX,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 17, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Sky,,"I love the material used for this cropped top. It's sooo soft and very stretchy. Like most things Pavoi, you should consider sizing up. I'm generally a small, but have to size up to a medium in Pavoi. That being said, this crop top is still very very short. My bras are always playing peekaboo when I wear it. It's not the end of the world, but I have to pick and choose when I want to wear it.",
Kenzie,Cropped,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IAJMTS253HSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTVHDJTX,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 10, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Sand,Verified Purchase,It is cropped! A lot shorter than in the picture and I’m a part of the itty bitty titty committee. It is insanely comfortable and works like a dream for layers. True to size but I would’ve liked it to not sit directly under where it shows the band of my bra.,

It looks very sporty. It is soft and comfortable. My daughter is 140 lb. 5 ft 5 and this fit her just like the photo shows. The fabric is breathable and tsoft. The fit is more like a stretchy soft texture.,

XXI,"Love it, but it's suuuuper stretchy, jsyk.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R258WX98X4UIWN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTVHDJTX,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 13, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,,"I have a love-hate relationship with this brand lol. I've had issues with sizing regarding PAVOI's clothes & jewelry, where some shirts have run super small and leggings have been crazily loose despite my use of size charts. I'm a 36DD 135 lbs and typically struggle with choosing a size small vs. an extra small when it comes to PAVOI's active tops. I got this in a small, and it basically fits like a rash guard or an extensive sports bra, and I love it. It's crazily soft and it's not restrictive, even around the ribs. If anything, it's actually too loose and I should've gotten the smallest size available. But, it's still wearable as it is. Not transparent (in black, at least), it's definitely thin though, so it's not exactly a 'braless' top, unless you have a smaller chest - literally zero support. It's also not for arm day, unless you're smaller chested lol. If you lift your arms and you're bigger than a B cup, you're probably gonna see underboob. I only gave four stars though because PAVOI's active tops seem to have a chronic shoulder issue where, no matter what, the shoulders kind of bunch up at the seams and look bulky even when the rest of the shirt fits perfectly. It's weird, nothing life-ruining, but I'm hoping it's maybe an aspect of design that can be improved in the future.",

I usually wear smalls or mediums depending on the style. I ordered medium for this one and it's still quite tiny and short. It's got stretchy material and it might shrink even further after wash. I'd definitely recommend to size up. Maybe two sizes up. It's really pretty and trendy I'm sure, however, since it's so small, I'm not sure if I can pull it off comfortably. I'll try and see this summer!",

I just didn’t like how the sleeves aren’t fitted like I like. The neckline was also kinda tight to put on and the shoulder area fits weird. It’s cropped but doesn’t show your business when working out. But overall, nice and comfortable material.",

This felt really nice on the skin. I did order a size large to accommodate for my chest, but it’s still ended up a little Shorter than I expected I’m usually a medium but wanted a little bit more length.

Pick’s by Cynthia,"Small in size, but good quality material",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WOE07NJE08N2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTVHDJTX,"3.0 "," the United States "," April 18, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,,"I typically wear a large or extra large. I bought this in hopes I could wear it with leggings to the gym. It's a little out of my comfort zone as a crop top, but YOLO.  The material is really nice, it fit in the shoulders, but the crop wasn't cropped enough, it stopped right below my bra. I don't know if it's a true XL, but maybe size up from what you normally wear if you purchase this top. If it had fit properly it would have been the perfect top. Love the style.",

My daughter wears an XS and it is often difficult to find. We were happy that this top came in XS and it fits her well. It runs a bit shorter than most styles, but she likes it. The quality is nice. It is a thicker material, so it doesn't appear to be thin and clingy, which is nice. The blue color is a nice, muted, smokey blue. Overall, very happy with this top.",
