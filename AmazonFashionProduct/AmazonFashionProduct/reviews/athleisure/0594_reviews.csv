Beth Ross,Very Comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AGUD4B51525I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCKP7RS,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Fit Type: RegularSize: MediumColor: Deep Navy,,"These are very well made and high quality for the price. I wear a lot of lululemon leggings, and these are comparable in feel. I got these to wear while walking, so the flared leg is more comfortable for that. Very cute and happy to have them!",
Stacie Martin,Nice!  Run small.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4RQH3T5ACOGE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCKP7RS,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Fit Type: RegularSize: MediumColor: Everpine,,"These are fun flare leggings, and I'd compare the quality to Old Navy or Aerie.  The Everpine color is gorgeous - a fairly neutral dark green, maybe leaning a bit warm.  Sizing wise, I would say they run small, so size up if you are on the line.  I typically wear a size 6 in pants, sometimes an 8, and usually choose Medium in letter sizing since a bit big is better than a bit small.  The Medium in these is quite snug on me.  Not uncomfortable, but they do fit more like a Small than a Medium compared to other brands.  One thing I love is that they're not hot!  I feel like they breathe pretty well so I don't immediately feel sweaty.",

I did have to hem them but I’m only  5’0” tall. They wash well, dry well, and wear great! No pilling and they have a nice weight to them without being too thick or see through. They’re great!",
Pam Deremiah,I have to cut off 4 inches.  Do women have 6’ legs,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RNF36C9VNOVJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCKP7RS,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 30, 2024",Fit Type: RegularSize: X-LargeColor: Everpine,Verified Purchase,I wish they came in petite.

These pants are a good fit. They are snug but stretchy. Good material. Flare legs/bell bottoms. High waist.  Can dress up or down. They are advertised as yoga pants or active pants, but I paired them with a cute pair of boots, black cami and a denim jacket for a night out outfit. Add a blazer for work attire. Versatile.  Good choice. Good price.",
Miss Campbell,Good quality thick fabric,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R248G8W6XFC9SJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCKP7RS,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 27, 2024",Fit Type: RegularSize: X-SmallColor: Iconic Black,,"These pants work great as jazz dance pants. The fit is very tight around the butt area, with a high waist, and then a gentle flare that starts about mid calf to the floor. The fabric is pretty thick and can stretch a ton without being see through. These wash up nicely and hang dry without losing their elasticity.",

The green color is nice, just what I expected. The fit overall is good, but if you’re taller than me (5’8”) they will be quite short on you—they’re only just long enough for me. My only complaint is that the material isn’t very thick. They feel a little thin and flimsy, but not too bad given the price. Overall I like them!",2

The color is such a rich chocolate brown, so easy to style. These leggings are buttery soft, thick but still breathable. Amazing quality! I’m 5’5 and the length is a little long for me but I don’t really mind. Perfect flare, not too much. The stretch is amazing but still snatches you. Super happy with this pair of leggings. I find myself reaching for them often",

They were not as dark brown as the product image shows in the listingand they were thinner fabric than I prefer. I honestly didn’t even bother trying them on because of this so I cannot review how they fit. I did hold them up to me and it appears as though the short length that I ordered would have been perfect for my height of 5’2”.,

They don't flatter the body well like typical yoga pants do either. The color is great, but there are no pockets. Kind of a miss for me.",

The fabric is incredibly soft and supportive without being restrictive. The high-waist is flattering and helps smooth and shape my waist. The waistband stays in place without digging into my skin, and the material is breathable and moisture-wicking. Definitely a 5-star buy!",
ElaineUKTX,"Comfortable, fit not good for me",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YDV5GTZ97JGH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCKP7RS,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2024",Fit Type: RegularSize: LargeColor: Everpine,,Check the color you get carefully - I thought I was ordering was black but received green.

So, I got the ""regular"" length in these and they are WAY too long. Even with sneakers on. They are about 6 inches too long on me. Very disappointed because otherwise, they are super comfy and soft.",3
Review,Not bad for price - but very long,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VATR1UIH3QAN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCKP7RS,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 12, 2024",Fit Type: RegularSize: MediumColor: Iconic Black,,"The reg length would probably be a long, in other brands. I am short, but I'll need to take a couple of inches off the length for me to be able to wear them. Fabric isn't bad for the price. The quality reminds me of other leggings in a similar price range. Decent compression. I got black and they seem to be squat proof.",

Cons: - No pockets. -Even though I ordered the correct size, there's not a lot of stretch through the midsection, and I heard a couple of stitches pop when I put them on the first time. - At 5'3"", the regular inseam is about 4 inches too long (on Vine, ordering the short inseam wasn't an option), and for me, that is the biggest drawback to this pair of leggings.",

The material is extremely comfortable to wear. The length of the L is a bit too long for my height (5’5) but I’m hoping they’ll eventually shrink just a bit. After a few washes these have kept their shape and size perfectly. They hug your thighs and midsection so be prepared to wear no shows to create that seamless look.  The material is quality, with no rips or loose strings. There are no blemishes or unsightly sections.",

But they're perfect! They have a medium amount of compression, which I like. When I'm crampy, it can feel really good to have compression on my midsection so these will be great. Material is soft and comfortable to wear. I do wish they had a pocket or two, but even without that, these are awesome!",
