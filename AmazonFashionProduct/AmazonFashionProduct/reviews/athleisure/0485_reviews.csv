Audrey T.,Love love love these!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30MUS43FLL32E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCVSLN21,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 16, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Borealis Green,Verified Purchase,"I have these shorts in two colors. This teal color and a navy. I bought them in two sizes as well. I prefer the large over the medium, but the medium works fine as well. Super cute to wear with a T-shirt and cute shoes for a more casual day or for a workout or hike. Great quality and value for money. They’re super flowy and I like the wide waistband. It’s not too constricting and is comfortable.",
Pauline Sanderson,I live in these!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HOCQ6STCOUBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCVSLN21,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 10, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Lip Gloss Pink,Verified Purchase,"I’m a new SAHM and these are great for chasing two rowdy boys. They’re so light, comfortable, cute, and flattering. I bought them in 5 colors for each weekday (I’m not crazy). The waistband holds you in but without being too tight and leaving marks if that makes sense and I have some postpartum weight still going on. The length is not too short but also not old mom ish if that makes sense. I have trouble with some shorts in the thigh area (athletic build) and these don’t ride up. If they do the skirt flap hides it well and makes me feel more covered up than just wearing shorts. Feminine and sporty vibes. The colors are so pretty and they wash well. I always get spit up on me and the oil stain from that washes out. If it’s a lot I’ll rub a stain stick on it and it does the trick. My husband might be upset if I order more so unfortunately I’ll wait until Christmas to ask for more haha",
