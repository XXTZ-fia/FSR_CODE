EG,So Comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8B3F2V109JH1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZP7L2X9,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 23, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"These pants have truly impressed me with their versatility, comfort, and style. These athletic leggings are perfect for a variety of activities, from working out to lounging at home. The fabric is incredibly soft and stretchy, providing a snug fit that moves with you during any activity.  One of the standout features is the practical design. The joggers come with well-placed pockets that are deep enough to securely hold my phone, keys, and other essentials while I’m on the go. This feature is a game-changer, especially when I’m out running or in the middle of a workout session, and I need easy access to my belongings. The waistband is wide and elastic, ensuring a comfortable fit that stays in place without digging into my skin.  The tapered leg design adds a modern and stylish touch to these joggers, making them suitable for both active and casual wear. I love that I can transition seamlessly from a yoga class to running errands without feeling underdressed. The material is also moisture-wicking, which keeps me dry and comfortable even during intense workouts. It’s evident that these pants were designed with the active woman in mind.  Another aspect that sets these joggers apart is their durability. I’ve washed them multiple times, and they still look and feel as good as new. The color doesn’t fade, and the fabric maintains its elasticity and softness. This level of quality is rare, especially at such an affordable price point.  I also appreciate the variety of colors and sizes available. There’s something for everyone, and finding the perfect fit is easy. The quality and affordability of these joggers make them a great addition to any wardrobe, whether you're an athlete or just someone who appreciates comfort and style in their everyday wear.  These pants have quickly become my go-to choice for workouts, yoga sessions, and casual outings. They offer the perfect blend of functionality and fashion, making them a must-have for any active woman. Highly recommended!",83
Casey Carville,Perfect,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YGNOACXPOI28/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZP7L2X9,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I’ve been looking for a pair of flattering joggers since I’m kind of tired of the leggings look. I was originally looking for some with jersey material when I came across these. I would describe them as a cross between joggers and leggings and they are fantastic! The material is similar to leggings - stretchy and silky. Like the kind of material dog/cat hair doesn’t stick to (this is super important to me because we have four dogs and three cats). They have slight compression through the lower belly which is great since I’ve had 2 kids. They are PERFECT for going to kids sport events or the gym. They feel super durable, not see through at all despite the leggings-like fabric, and perfect weight material for any season (at least in Texas). For fit reference, I’m about 10 pounds heavier than I usually am right now and I’m fairly bottom-heavy. Right now, I wear medium in leggings, 10-12 in jeans, and medium T-shirts. Since these are joggers, I wanted a looser fit so I got a Large… as you can see by the pics they are NOT loose. I would definitely say they are more snug than expected but I actually love them. I rarely go by the size charts since my measurements always put me in between sizes, but in this case, I think the size chart would probably have been pretty accurate and with my current weight & measurements, and XL would have given me the fit I thought I was looking for. But once I lose this extra 10-15 pounds from the holidays they’ll be perfect. I’m 5’5”, 180 pounds. Measurements are bust: 40” (36 DD), waist 33”, hips 45”.",44

Slick nylon feel yoga pant material (as opposed to Terry, jersey or cotton). Its 80% polyamide, 20% spandex. Has some stretch. Soft comfort feel.  Love pockets, and wide band at waist.

Pros: great for price point, light weight material, wide waist band (comfy) and has pockets  Cons: a bit short for me (I have longer legs for my height), too big in lower stomach/hips and under butt. I bought a S and should have ordered a XS.  These would probably be good for a lean, straight build (the fabric would hang nicely) or curvy build (could nicely fill out the cut). My bigger butt (but no hips) to smaller legs body shape made the fabric buckle in a weird way on my build.",27
