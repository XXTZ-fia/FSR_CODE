I’ve been looking for a nice basic piece like this that I can wear for different occasions and I was so surprised when this came in the mail because it’s really high-quality and it fits so well! It is a body-con fit so it’s going to show off your sexy curves ;) I always feel super sexy and confident in it! The material is very nice and high quality! It is super soft, smooth and buttery, almost like the skims fabric, which I love. The fabric hugs your body so it’s very comfortable! It is almost like a second skin. I love how this item is so versatile too! I could wear it as a sexy dress or tuck it into my jeans and wear it as a tank top. It’s  just so cute, minimal, and easy to style. For your reference, I ordered a size small in black, and I am 125lbs, 5’4”. Overall, I highly recommend this item and I will definitely be getting them in all the colors!!",7

I bend and get up and down a lot and everything stays covered and in place.  It is WAY easier than using a leotard, especially for quick restroom breaks.  They seem durable as my first two have been washed for over a year and have held their shape and compression.  I am 5'7"" and these are long enough to completely cover my backside.  One shirt was a little too tight under the armpits and i gave each a small snip with scissors to release the binding.  It hasn't run or shred in that area at all after many months of use and washes.  It's a great undershirt for these purposes!  I have these in black, grey, and navy and use them multiple times a week.",2

The fabric is really soft, comfy, and stretchy so the small/medium can fit a good range of sizes. I like the color much more than I thought. I already have black and white dresses, so I wanted to give it a shot and I am pleasantly surprised! I am 5'4 and around 115 pounds and the dress is not too long or too short, I really like the length :). Honestly, this dress can be really versatile too, I would definitely wear it on a night out, but if I throw on a cardigan and a tote bag, the dress becomes super casual. I might even consider getting it in some other colors too. Overall I REALLY like this dress and would recommend it to others.",3

First, I bought the taupe which is a great color, classic that isn't muted or bland, but a rich taupe color. Size wise, it fits as expected and there aren't any weird spots where it is too tight or too loose. Because the material is polyester and spandex, it is form fitting, so if you want some room and for it to hang rather than be body hugging, go up a size. The overall, look, feel, and quality makes it worth the purchase.",

I got so many compliments! When you buy clothes online, you can run the risk of it not fitting properly, but this tank was very true to size. I’m 120 lbs and 5’3”, usually wear size small, and this top fit like a glove  The material feels high end and is very smooth and buttery soft on your skin. It is a long tank top, but it’s long enough to wear as a dress for me (but it might not be long enough for taller ladies). I prefer wearing this as a tank top though, as it gives you a more snatched/hugged look like a bodysuit but without the annoying crotch part.",4

You can also wear this under your other dresses or high waisted pants for a slimming effect. But I bought it as a dress itself. It’s form fitting without squeezing the life out of you, (for women if you know you know!) It is technically a long tank, but I also hiked it up a little for my photos, so it is a bit longer than pictured. It’s my new favorite staple item in my closet and I’ve been wearing it every day since I got it! You won’t regret this purchase! 🖤",

It is always difficult to buy clothes online because you just don't know if they will fit right however this shirt was perfect.  I have been looking for a tank top that I can use as an undershirt so it needed to be pretty long in length and fit plus size. This shirt delivered on all accounts. Plenty of length and stretchy.  I wear it all the time.  Only negative about the shirt is that the material began to pill after a while of washing.  For me though I was ok with that because I really like the fit.  I'm willing to deal with that and don't mind ordering more shirts once the old ones get to ragged to wear. I would recommend this product to others.,
