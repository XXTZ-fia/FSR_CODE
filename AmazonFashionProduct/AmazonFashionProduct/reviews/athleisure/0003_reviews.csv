The fit is true to size, so there’s no need to guess or size up/down—it fits perfectly and looks flattering.

The fabric is medium weight, making it ideal for lounging, running errands, or even casual outings. It’s stylish yet effortless, and can easily be dressed up or down.  If you’re looking for a comfortable, well-made, and machine washable set, this outfit is a fantastic choice. Highly recommend!",5

Allison Katrina,Olive is not olive,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R170P7XWNWB4HC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B093GWGLN9,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 21, 2022",Color: Army GreenSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"I have a beautiful hourglass figure.  I liked the elevated style of a jogger-type outfit, something I could where to lounge in, look ok on camera in, maybe even go to the office in on a casual day.  The texture of this outfit along with the matching colors were very appealing. I ordered olive, but it is not a true olive.  Not quite forest green, maybe pine, but it does not feel like a fresh modern color to me.  The texture of the fabric felt a little like long- Johns and I think that is because the fabric is thin. I like that for comfort but it makes it a bit clingy.  Parts of the pants fit so well - the crotch and butt are perfect! The thighs and calves were not even throughout; in places tight, in places loose, so they didn’t hang exactly right.  The top looked in pre-view photos as if it would cover your hips and bottom, but it is not that long.  It is a nice cut and very comfortable.  I do wear this to lounge in, and it works ok for wearing on camera, lighting can be forgiving and there isn’t a focus on the bottom half. I wouldn’t feel very comfortable wearing this to the office…or the gym.",27

The tag is sewn into the seam, so I had to cut the seam open to remove the tag and then sew it back together. Just cutting the tag left a scratchy edge behind.  For reference, I'm 5'5 and 135 lbs (about a size 6) and the medium fit well. The top is very loose, but it fits how it looks in the picture, and the pants fit right.
