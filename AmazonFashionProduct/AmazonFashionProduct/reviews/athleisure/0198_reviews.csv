It is loose enough that one could wear another shirt underneath it.  The sleeves are a bit long.  I had to roll up the cuff so it would fit my arms.  The hemline isn’t tight across one’s body.  It falls past my hip and crotch area.  Overall, it is a decent sweatshirt.  It wouldn’t be on my Top Ten list.  Upon arrival, there were no loose seams or hanging threads when I inspected it.The sweatshirt is way too casual to wear to church or an office-type environment.  It would be perfect for a luncheon with friends, walking the dog, going out at the mall, going to a movie, or simply hanging around the house with your friends and family.  It can be paired with jeans, yoga pants, leggings, sweatpants, or shorts.  Don’t forget your shoes when completing your ensemble:  sandals, sneakers, or even Crocs.To maintain the quality of this sweatshirt, hand or machine wash in cold water.  Dry on a low setting.  Ironing on a low setting is fine.This sweatshirt is just okay for me.  It is made well enough, and the material is on the thinner side so you won’t overheat.  I would recommend it if you want something simple to wear.",4

I always order up in sizes on sweatshirts because I like them loose. This fits like I had ordered my size or even possibly a size down from what I typically wear. Also, the band around the waist is kind of tight for a ""loose"" fit. Everything about the description is misleading. I feel like I should give it one star, but the material is soft enough, the style of the sweatshirt is fine, and it's something I can use, so I opted for a three star rating instead.

Laura,Soft and comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OVVTYSXJOB73/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCNLB7HW,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 16, 2024",Color: D-apricotSize: Medium,,The material of this is more like a lightweight sweater than a sweatshirt in spite of the styling. It isn’t too oversized. I usually order mediums in sweatshirts as I like them a little bigger and this fits as I would have expected. The apricot color is a nice pale pink/peach and will be quite versatile. It washes nicely and is quite comfortable. I will be wearing this a lot this fall!,

Mi815,Love the color,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ALE5X7R5U6MZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCNLB7HW,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 22, 2024",,,"PROS: Made of lightweight 65%Polyester 35%Cotton fabric. It has a zipper that pulls smoothly. The color is like a dusty lavender. It’s more like a heavy t-shirt instead of a sweatshirt.  CONS: The length is shorter than the photos of the models. It hits me at the top of my hips and I was hoping for booty coverage.  Overall I love the color of this shirt. However, I feel as though this shirt is over priced.",
