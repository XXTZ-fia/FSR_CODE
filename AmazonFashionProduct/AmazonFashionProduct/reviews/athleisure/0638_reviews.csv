AM,It’s not the softest thing I own,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12A0V2IBIK1P2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09C2DZBZJ,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 25, 2024",Color: Young Color Block Dark Grey & Light GreySize: X-Small,Verified Purchase,"I’m just under 5’ (4-11-1/2) & the XS was a perfect fit. If this was cotton, I’d give it 5 stars. I like everything about it EXCEPT the texture. It’s definitely not thick like traditional a sweatshirt, but just perfect for a lounge set. Color is great, pockets are nice but, it’s the darn fabric for me. I kept it, I wear it, but I can’t stand it without a tank top under the shirt. It definitely has a plastic feel & I wish so bad it didn’t. If you’re ultra sensitive to things that aren’t super soft, skip it.",
