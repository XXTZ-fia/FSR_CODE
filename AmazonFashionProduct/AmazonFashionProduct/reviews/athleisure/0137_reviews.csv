I am 5' 8"" tall and weigh 145 lbs. Most of the exercise tops in the stores now are geared for younger women(in my opinion) because the length barely goes to the waist. I wanted something a little longer than that so that I could wear it to physical therapy or to exercise in and this top gives much better coverage...approximately to the middle of my hips. A size large was selected but I think I might have been able to wear a medium. I used my sewing machine to take the sides in because it was a little too wide, making it look somewhat sloppy. I had to take the hem apart a little to do that. It was a lot of extra work but I am very happy now with how it looks on me.",9
