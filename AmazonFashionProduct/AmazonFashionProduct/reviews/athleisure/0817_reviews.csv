(Yuck. I don't want to be dressed in plastic.) Because of the low price I was somehow expecting it to be cheap quality, but I was wrong.  The first thing that impressed me was how really super soft the t-shirt is. It feels really nice. It's pretty lightweight, and it's 95% cotton, so it will be nice and comfortable in the warm weather. The color is also very pretty. It fits me well, but it should be noted that I did order a size up from my usual size.  I don't like the bottoms quite as well. Although they are also 95% cotton, which I definitely like, I was hoping for a regular pair of leggings, but these are not fitted enough through the upper legs to really call them that in my book. One might say they're fitted stretch trousers, except the fabric is a bit sheer for that, in fact it's a little sheer in general, although I must say quite comfortable.  Overall a very nice natural fiber no frills combo for a very reasonable price.",
