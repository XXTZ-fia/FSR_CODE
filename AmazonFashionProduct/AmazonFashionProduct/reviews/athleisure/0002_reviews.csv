Kate,Great top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KGDVL90PYRX9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YQL44TQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 15, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Green(brushed Fleece Lined),Verified Purchase,"The fabric is soft, cozy, and warm, but not overly warm.  I am 5'8"" with a 41.5"" bust.  The large size in this top fits me beautifully and is very flattering.  The sleeves are long enough for me and the hemline covers most of my behind.  If I get a little too warm during an active day, I just unzip the zipper.  Perfect!  I like this top so much I ordered a second one in another color.  Great top!",
Shopgirl19,Excellent fleece lined top for real women,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NRH3QDXCI9R4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YQL44TQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 9, 2020",Size: LargeColor: Green(brushed Fleece Lined),Verified Purchase,"I was so happy with this top that I just ordered the blue one also.  I wanted the  “black-2” color but they  were out.  It has a nice fleece on the inside and is perfect for cooler temps.  The color is exactly as shown.  The quality is excellent.  The sleeves are not cut too slim like some sporty tops, but  more comfortable for slightly larger arms.  It also has room over the hips and is not too snug.  Washes excellently.  It is a very attractive fit for curvy women and they will appreciate it.  Straight body types may not like this cut because it has ample hip room.  I also ordered the black with the thinner cloth, but it was a totally different fit and too thin like nylon. Had to return it.  The other three are excellent and I am very happy.",13
