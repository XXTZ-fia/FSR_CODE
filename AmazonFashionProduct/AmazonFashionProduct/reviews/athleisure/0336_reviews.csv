They offer a sleek, form-fitting design with the perfect amount of stretch, making them ideal for anything from high-intensity workouts to relaxed, everyday wear. The material is super soft and feels amazing on the skin! They fit snugly, hugging your body in a flattering way without ever feeling tight or restrictive. Whether you’re hitting the gym, running errands, or just relaxing, they move effortlessly with you.  The color is vibrant and hasn’t faded, and the quality is outstanding. They also keep me warm, which is a huge plus. The only thing to note is a slight smell when first opened, but it completely disappeared after a wash. I’ll definitely be buying another pair!",5

They’re snug but not tight.  They don’t roll down, even though they’re high waisted. That’s a miracle all on its own.  They are ACTUALLY buttery soft smooth, like That One Brand - except the fabric is snappier and tighter, not as loose as That One Brand. This works really well because these are definitely more of a workout style, rather than a cute/fashion style.  The seems feel good quality, and there are pockets! And they’re actually the right size for a phone. The fabric is also good quality - not thin, not thick, not warm, not cool. They’re just right.  The color is also true to the picture, a nice olive green.  I couldn’t be more pleased with these. They weren’t cheap, but they’re worth it as long as they last.",34
