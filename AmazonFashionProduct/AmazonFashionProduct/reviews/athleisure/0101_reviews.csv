Anna,Returned only for a hole in the leg seam.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYXVVDQNSZQV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08LBF6PZZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 27, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black Tie Dye,Verified Purchase,I love these type of pants. You can make them look more dressy or more casual. They fit true to size. They’re stretchy and I have multiple pairs of this brand and the crz something brand that have similar pants. I only returned the last pair because they had a huge hole in the seam on the thigh when I got them. Definitely get a black and navy pair! They go with everything! I’ve worn them with hey dudes and a nice shirt and looked business casual. I’ve also worn them with a sweatshirt and was comfy both ways!,5
mom o'three,Comfortable and perfect fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHXXOTHL1A8VN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08LBF6PZZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 10, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I was expecting these pants to be good, but not this good! So soft, thick waistband doesn’t roll, it at the perfect point on leg, lightweight, but not so much that they crumple, and frankly an absolute bargain compared to other pants out there. They hit just the tiniest bit above my natural waist. So nice to find a pair of pants like this that doesn’t come up to my rib cage!  They are definitely casual, so I might describe with the reviews that say you can dress them up or down, but definitely a less casual alternative to sweatpants. Will probably buy in other colors!",9
Page,Flattering,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R226PBLI7HHMBD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08LBF6PZZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Navy,Verified Purchase,"I am 165 lbs @ 5'3"", measuring 36DD-32-42, and I wear a sz 12 in AE jeans. I bought these pants in a sz XL in Navy. These pants are extremely flattering, fit perfectly around the waist with a real draw string, nice pockets, and a perfect length for me at a half inch from the floor at my heel. The fit even disguises my small belly pooch. The material is soft and cool to the touch, a polyester I'm sure, thin but sturdy, and dark blue. Something that I'm disappointed in is that the hem of my boyshort underwear shows through the pants. I wanted to be able to wear these for quick errands, and not have to worry about vpl. Also, the description says these are sweatpants, but they are not what I would describe as sweats. They are a material similar to track or yoga pants.",4

Large booty. Hard to find workout pants that fit me. Leggings look silly with my thunder thighs lol. These are more fitted on me than other joggers but loose enough to not be leggings. Comfortable and very breathable. Some of the tech fabrics trap moisture or are itchy, these feel cool on the skin and I can feel air movement! I will prob order a few different colors! I think these will not only be great work hot pants, but could just be fun casual pants with the right top!  They’re stretchy and my guess is the xxl would fit a curvy size 14 on up to a size 18 or maybe even 20.  If the company is looking for a plus size person to endorse on social media, I would totally do it!",22

The deep pockets are a game-changer, easily holding essentials like a phone or keys. The lightweight fabric is breathable yet durable, making these pants ideal for any activity. They wash well and retain their shape and softness.  If you’re looking for versatile pants that combine function and style, these are a must-have. Highly recommend!",4
K,Comfy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8JB4K6JUILSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08LBF6PZZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 22, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"**Update 04/2024** I repurchased these in a size XL in the color OLIVE GREEN, just to see if I liked them better in a bigger size. I often prefer to size up now, as due to a surgery I had years ago, my lower tummy has gotten sensitive to things pressing on it. While these are definitely looser in the waist than the L, I think they unfortunately look a little sloppy. They're baggy in the crotch and just overall don't look like they fit as well. I may have not minded that in black, but in this slightly lighter shade, it's pretty obvious. I'm a bit in the fence about if I'll repurchase the large or not, we'll see.  I got these in the color BLACK in a size LARGE. For sizing reference, I'm usually a medium-large or a 8-12/29-31 in bottoms and jeans. If it helps, I wear a size 6 or 8 in Lulu leggings. I'm 5'3"" tall with a short torso, and my measurements are about 44""-33""-44"" (bust-waist-hip) right now, give or take.  I found these to be mostly TTS, though I'd recommend potentially sizing up if you have larger hips/butt. I still had plenty of room but would potentially size up to an XL if I wanted them baggier.  The material is super soft and stretchy, more brushed than athletic, though it has a hint of slickness to it. They are super comfortable.  The style is interesting, as it looks like it would be a jogger but it's cropped instead. I personally hate joggers, so I thought these were a nice change. I have thicker thighs and calves from years of soccer and these were super forgiving in those areas. I'm a little on the shorter side and found the length was a bit longer than I'd prefer, but I can just roll them up twice and they're perfect, or get them hemmed. In my picture, my left leg has the hem rolled and the right leg does not, so you can see the difference. They hit the top of my foot unrolled.  I really like these because they're good for running around, working out, or even for casual workwear. I do wish they didn't have the logo on the leg and instead had them either on the back of the waistband, and/or made it tonal so it wasn't obvious.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend these. I don't know if I'll grab any other colors, as I don't wear this type of thing often, but I still like them.",236

I don’t love to wear leggings outside of the gym, so joggers are a great alternative for those types of activities. The material is a very thin performance material, which means they don’t provide much warmth, but I think this brand sells a fleece-lined version as well. I do like the fit. I’m 5’5” and 148lbs with a typical hourglass shape. Small waist, wider hips/bottom. The medium was a perfect fit for what I wanted.

However I ended up removing the inner elastic from the waist and now they fit perfect. They sit flat on my waist and the draw string allows for a natural waist adjustment. The waist may not be an issue for smaller waisted women, but for apple shapes the elastic waist may be a bit problematic in terms of creating a muffin top with the way it is. However if you're handy with the sewing machine, it's an easy and quick fix. Otherwise, I like the fabric, it's smooth, cool, it doesn't wrinkle, dries super fast, and no changes after multiple wears and washes. The side pockets are also great, they are functional and again create a nice hip line for someone with narrow hips. Definitely reccomend this one.",109
