Gabrielle O'Neill,Love these for everyday wear!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JSEFUG8NQ00C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VQ4SMKB,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 11, 2024",Special Size: Regular SizeSize: MediumColor: Set 6,Verified Purchase,"I recently purchased a few dry fit tops, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. These tops have quickly become a staple in my workout wardrobe, and I am thoroughly impressed with their performance and quality.  First and foremost, the dry fit material used in these tops is exceptional. It is lightweight, breathable, and moisture-wicking, which makes it perfect for intense workout sessions. The fabric quickly absorbs sweat and dries fast, keeping me cool and comfortable throughout my workouts. I no longer have to worry about feeling sticky or weighed down by sweat-soaked clothes.  The fit of these tops is also fantastic. They are designed to be form-fitting without being restrictive, allowing for a full range of motion during exercise. The stretchy fabric and ergonomic seams ensure that the tops move with my body, providing a comfortable and supportive fit. I appreciate how these tops hug my curves without feeling too tight or constricting.  Durability is another standout feature of these dry fit tops. Even after multiple washes, the fabric remains in excellent condition, maintaining its shape and color. The tops have proven to be resistant to pilling and fading, which is a testament to their high-quality construction. I can confidently say that these tops will withstand the test of time and regular use.  I also appreciate the versatility of these tops. They are not only suitable for workouts but also stylish enough to be worn as casual attire. Whether I'm hitting the gym, going for a run, or simply running errands, these tops provide both functionality and fashion. The sleek and modern design adds a touch of style to my activewear collection.  Furthermore, the variety of colors and styles available is impressive. There are numerous options to choose from, allowing me to find tops that suit my personal style and preferences. Whether I want a basic black top or a vibrant colored one, there is a wide range of choices to cater to different tastes.  Lastly, the price point of these dry fit tops is reasonable and well worth the investment. Considering the quality, performance, and versatility they offer, I believe they provide excellent value for money. I have seen other similar tops on the market at higher price points, but these tops have certainly exceeded my expectations without breaking the bank.  In conclusion, I highly recommend these dry fit tops to anyone in need of comfortable and high-performance activewear. The superior moisture-wicking properties, excellent fit, durability, versatility, and reasonable price make them a top choice for workout enthusiasts like myself. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and will definitely be adding more of these tops to my collection.",19
Savannah,Actually plus size!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PPJAI7DF97TC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VQ4SMKB,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 6, 2024",Special Size: Plus SizeSize: 1XColor: Set 12,Verified Purchase,"Ordered the 1X (my regular size) and fits like a loose crop top; if you're looking for oversized, I'd go up at least once. Hits me right at the belly button. It's breathable and great for working out but does tend to ride up a bit during more strenuous workouts. Deducting a star because there were loose threads after the first wash; it's not falling apart and I've washed them several times since, just kind of annoying. I think they're worth the price though considering how many you get.",

Gretchen Macdowall,Nice summer tops,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37VKPIM21HMKK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VQ4SMKB,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 22, 2024",Special Size: Regular SizeSize: MediumColor: Set 12,Verified Purchase,"I got these to replace some worn summer t-shirts.  I like the fabric, which is very light, and the design. They are loose and swingy at the bottom so they are easy to put on and take off. The neck is wide enough to get over a ponytail but not so wide that it shifts to show bra straps. They cold-water wash and  medium dry without shrinking. The only slight negative is that a light color, which is the bright green in my collection, will show a bra underneath.",
Ashley,Cute and comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYZVK89LPQFKY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VQ4SMKB,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 14, 2024",Special Size: Regular SizeSize: SmallColor: Set 6,Verified Purchase,"Super cute and comfy. I like that they’re cropped, but a little longer than some other crop tops. I can wear with mid rise bottoms and not show too much skin. The material is great for hot and humid summers",

I wouldn't wear them out and about.  after 1st washing they were already having hem issues,
Tiffany Blackley,Dri-fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3T0RNJVL8BW9Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09VQ4SMKB,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 27, 2024",Special Size: Regular SizeSize: LargeColor: Set 2,Verified Purchase,"I purchased these shirts for our trip to Costa Rica, and I’m so glad I did! Especially on our rainforest hike where it poured on us. I was able to wring my shirt out and throw it back on. It kept me cool in the humidity, and dried quickly after the down pours.",6

I got them because I was wanting to start my own fitness journey and I think these are a great start. I will say though the the coral looking top with the black, green, dark blue, and light purple pack, is not coral, it is a bright red",2
