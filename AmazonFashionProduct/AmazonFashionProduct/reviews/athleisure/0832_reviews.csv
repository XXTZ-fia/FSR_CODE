elba,Comfortable and Stylish Athletic Dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNDYYB12CMIAN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CR9V4P9Y,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 16, 2024",Color: Rose TaupeSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"This dress is perfect for both athletic activities and casual outings. The square neckline and short sleeves give it a flattering and modern look, while the built-in shorts add functionality and comfort. The fabric is soft, breathable, and stretches just the right amount, making it great for sports like tennis or golf.  The addition of pockets is a thoughtful touch, offering convenience without compromising style. It fits true to size and feels great throughout the day. I highly recommend this dress for anyone looking for a blend of fashion and practicality!",

I have returned and/or disliked almost all the clothing I got on amazon, but I took a chance with this. It looks amazing and the compression makes me feel very secure. Not built in bra but with the compression you can get away without one. It is a bit much for every day as it is short and the square neck is pretty low [for myself, I am sure others can rock it!] so I am using it for when I want to dress up a bit but it is HOT AF out [like going into the city for brunch in 90 degree humid weather!]. Love the built in pocket on the shorts too. Overall I am soo happy I got this it feels like a good staple for a wardrobe hole I had in the summer!",6

Autumn Dunnam,SO comfortable & cute!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6COTZG2DQIJ5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CR9V4P9Y,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 12, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"This is the cutest & most comfortable athletic dress I own. I’m very picky on my materials & the quality of fabric used in athletic styles and this dress is well made. The fabric & stitching is well done. The material itself is not too thick, it’s breathable. I am in between sizes- I’m a M/L depending on stretching of fabrics. I have an athletic build (powerlifter), weigh 170lbs; Hips 45”, Bust 32”, Waist 30”, Thighs 25”. This dress smooths & tightens in all the right places. I probably could’ve sized down for a tighter fit to a medium, but I like to be able to have some room in my outfits so I am happy ordering the L! When going to the bathroom you do have to pull it over your shoulders so if you are more broad there I would consider sizing up as to not wear & tear the stitching on the arm area from taking on/off. This dress does not have padding on the top. I don’t feel like it’s needed since it’s double lined but if you have more going on up top that’s something to consider.  If you’re debating ordering this dress just go ahead and order it. You won’t regret it!!",17

I'm one who has been gaining a bit of weight, so I decided to size up to a medium, when normally I'm a small. I am a 5'7"" tall girl with a bit of curves and wide shoulders. This fit nicely! A bit tighter than I expected, but it was snug. I thought about sizing up to a large for future purchases, but I feel like it would be too big at that point.  NOTE!! The shorts are cozy, a bit shorter than expected, but I guess that is more due to my height. They also ride up a lot when walking! You will be constantly pulling them down so you are not in a wedgie the whole time. Also, if you order the brown for exercising, note that the sweat marks are super noticeable!!! Went to NYC recently with this on and within two minutes of walking, I had boob sweat marking all underneath and had to go purchase a flowy dress to avoid the stares. Although that was on me to wear this on a hot day, it shows that if you are to use it to exercise, expect sweat marks.  Overall, love the dress, have gotten many complements on it, and recommend sizing up!",

If it wasn't for the tight fit around my arms and shoulders, I would have kept it. Even though the XL was tight in the chest, it would have still be doable even with a padded bra. I ordered a darker color and the light blue, and my bra lines were visible through the light blue but not the black.

Got the small. I would get a smaller size if you are 100 pounds, the S is not tight pretty loose. Not too showy in the breast. Can be pulled down or up to make appropriate. Not too short at all. I was scared of that. Super comfy. Nice enough material to wear to a wedding or you can go to this in the gym",4

I bought a cheaper one then ended up being disappointed. Decided to buy this one and it fits perfectly. The shorts inside are also perfect. I have bigger thighs and it didn’t cut off my circulation.,
