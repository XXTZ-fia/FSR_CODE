The first thing I noticed was the charming v-neck design, complemented by a couple of decorative buttons that add just the right amount of flair without being overly flashy. The material is thinner than I expected, which makes it perfect for layering. It’s breathable enough to wear during transitional seasons while still providing that cozy feel we all love. I appreciate that it runs true to size; I opted for my usual size, and it fits perfectly without being too tight or too loose. The versatility of this shirt is impressive. I’ve styled it in various ways – from pairing it with high-waisted jeans for a casual day out to wearing it under a denim jacket for a chic layered look. The hood and drawstrings give it a relaxed vibe, making it ideal for those laid-back days when comfort is key. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enhance their casual collection.",

The design is flattering with a simple straight cut hemline and button front neck.  I love the addition of the hood, though the drawstring came out in the first wash.  It was too much of a hassle to put back in and luckily it looks fine without the strings.  The waffle knit is thin and a bit see through, so i found nudes bra or undershirt worked best with it.  I typically wear a S/M top and ordered this one in a S.  I think the size up would have fit more like the model pictures, but the shirt is cut a little baggier so the smaller size still worked fine.",

That's what you get with this top. It's so pretty and the waffle fabric makes this top look like you have put in extra work to look nice.  Anything that saves me time and looks stunning as well, I'm here for. The material is soft. The buttons are appropriately sized to open the top button or close. That's just a personal preference.  On nights I have to run in and change into a top and jeans for a football game or activity at the school for the kids, this fits the bill. I look great.  If I'm home relaxing on Saturdays watching football with my husband and I'm in sweats or yoga pants for comfort, this shirt fits the bill for that also.  The versatility of this top is what I love most about it. Plus, it's just so pretty and comfortable. You can't go wrong with that. I may have to buy a couple more.",4

On the model it shows a deep V then the buttons. It's not like that in real like. The V ends like at your collar bones.  Now this shirt is a nice fabric, it's actually pretty soft and the way it's made you absolutely could wear it all year round. I got the green color and it's beautiful. It also runs true to size!",
