The fit is very flattering and true to size. The material is soft and comfortable, making it a great choice for lounging or sleeping. I was also pleased that the color matches the picture exactly, which isn’t always the case with online purchases.  However, I did notice a few downsides. After washing, the material seemed to lose its fresh look and appeared a bit worn, which was disappointing. For the price, I expected better durability. While it’s not a dealbreaker, it does make me question the overall value.  Overall, it’s not a bad option if comfort is your priority, but be mindful of the price and how the material holds up over time.",

The way I remedy this is issue is by folding the pants around the waistline...Other than useless waistline straps, this is an awesome PJ set!  I’m 5’ and I weigh about 90lbs (on a “good day”! LOL). Since there was no option to buy this in extra-small (though I usually like my PJ’s a bit loose rather than snug), I purchased this in Small.  The length of the pants is perfect, which surprised me because pants in small adult sizes are usually a bit longer than my legs...sometimes, quite longer, which requires hem adjustments. Well, not these pants!!! YAY!! It almost made me forget about the silly, useless waistline strings...lol...  I’m very trim in my upper body and this top fits me perfectly without being too snug. It’s stretchy so the Small would definitely fit someone a bit taller and a bit larger than me but I think, as far as petite sizes go and if you’re concerned that this will be too large because you’re a “petite small”, this is a bit smaller than many pajamas that I purchased in small (American) adult sizes...so, to except that there’s no adjusting waistline straps, and considering that I don’t like super snug PJ’s, this Small is perfect for my “petite small” size!  I absolutely love 92 to 95% polyester and 5 to 8% spandex fabric blend! It’s THE SOFTEST fabric blend period and therefore, my favorite fabric for PJ’s and “lounge/stay-at-home” comfortable type of clothes.  Colors are extremely vivid and there has been no color fading and I already washed it twice! Note: I washed it in (HE machine) and used cold water on delicate cycle and hung dried it. I took it out of the washer immediately after the cycle was done and there were NO WRINKLES!  If the size is a match for you, I wouldn’t hesitate to buy this PJ set! It’s good quality, beautiful, and super comfy!  Now...if only Polo would get a clue about waistline straps...lol...",12

Joey B’s Reviews & Demos,"Love these (but don’t follow the other reviews, these are true to size..",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34ME4BUJKJ6W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DT2TY8MF,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"I read the reviews on this and ordered a size up (usually I take a small but I ordered a large based on the reviews) the large is large.... Other than that these pjs are awesome and sosososo soft! I’m returning the large for a small, now that I got to see how big the large really is( any reviews saying the large is the same as a small are very wrong, both the top and bottoms were large, way too big. When I get the small I’ll update this review to see how small this small really is and I hope my guestimation is right bc I really love these pjs. (I originally ordered the blue with pink stars but after seeing it, that style is more for a kid and I am a mom (lol) so I’m ordering the small grey stripes, I’m keeping my fingers crossed that this style size small Is true to size. Overall get your real size bc these will be the softest pjs you’ve ever owned!  *UPDATE* I ordered the stripes in size small and they pants fit perfectly and are so soft and comfortable. The top fits, it’s just tight fitting but not too tight because the fabric makes the shirt and pants have some stretch to it which makes this set! If you size up the bottoms will be too big in my opinion, these models must be really small and thin for the pjs to hang a little on them like the do in these pics, I have room in the pants but the shirt fits like a thermal which I like. I’d recommend buying these it’s just seems as though the blue ones run bigger, for some reason? Regardless these are cute .",
