I’ve purchased them multiple times over the years, but recently, the fit has changed drastically. The new version is extremely tight in the waist—even though I usually have extra room there.  I sized up to a 1X, but it was still too tight. The 2X was tight in the waist while being overly baggy and awkward everywhere else. I even tried a 3X, and while the waist fit more like the old XL, the rest of the pants looked ridiculously oversized and unwearable.  Unfortunately, I can no longer recommend these. I wish they would return to the previous manufacturer because the new fit is completely off.",
