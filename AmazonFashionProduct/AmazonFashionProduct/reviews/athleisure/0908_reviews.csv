Kindle Customer,ABSOLUTE FAVORITE SHIRT EVER!!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ3T5L47Q9AHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09NNDY6W7,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 19, 2024",Color: Chive BlossomSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,I would give this 100 stars if I could. I wear this (and the 7 others I bought in various colors) every day to the gym. It is the most comfortable top ever! I am somewhat busty but don’t need an additional sports bra with it as the built in support is more than enough. It has light padding which gives a seamless look and super durable. They have gone through many wash cycles and don’t show any wear. I love the different colors and will definitely be buying more colors to add to my rotation. Absolutely love them!!!,3

I normally wear a large and I’m wearing a large in these photos. I absolutely LOVE these! They are so much of a staple that I have three white ones and one yellow. I’ve washed them multiple times- no discolorations, no shrinkage, no pilling! Soft and hugging stretch, not a firm material so it moves with your body. It doesn’t seem like it would be as secure as it actually is. I do sometime cover my chest when bending over because I feel like there can be a bit of open gap between breast and bra but not by much. Wouldn’t be my first pick for deadlift days. The straps do not slip off even when running. It has a shelf bra and after every wash I never have to adjust the little pads, they just stay in place, so that’s really convenient. I do a lot of running in these and so with all that bouncing I NEVER have to adjust this top during my workout, it’s my #1 top for my big cardio days or back days (to see the muscle). Give it a chance, it might turn out to be your favorite! So comfy.",

It’s going to bunch up while you move and sometimes you can see where the cup pads are. From the back, you can’t really see the twist part. Overall, I’d say it’s okay for weight lifting and moderate cardio. I wouldn’t do a HIIT class or Zumba class since this top may require some adjusting with bigger movements. I like to size down on any kind of sports bra type top. I’m a 34D and the small fits just fine. I gave 4 stars because part of the stitching became loose after a wash.
