K. M. Saunders,So comfy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FY60S10YLFQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BD6QBJC2,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: Pitaya RedSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"I love this Lululemon dupe!  Usually Lululemon tops are made for models who have long arms, but this one fits me perfectly. It is well made and soft. Love the color too. For reference, my chest measurement is 36 inches and I ordered a size small. It's fits slim on me so if you want it to fit looser, order the next size up. It's cropped so the waist sits at my belly button. It's a nice top for the prize and look of a more expensive version.",5
CS,"Nice material, quality seems good",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7989P59D8RKZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BD6QBJC2,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Color: Off-whiteSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I like the thickness of the fabric, the stitching detail looks well done. I haven’t washed it yet. I appreciate the high neck, I think the front lock could be a smidgen larger so your hands can go into the pockets easily when you have thumbs in the cuffs. I do like the cuffs. The color is kind of creamy with grey. It’s seems to fit well, slightly oversized and a bit boxy. I had just taken it out the packaging in the photos.",10
allent365,Cute and comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMLVMXWJFBOL5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BD6QBJC2,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 2, 2024",Color: Off-whiteSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"Super cute and comfy, feels very well made. The fabric doesn’t stretch, however, so if you have long arms the thumb holes might feel tight. However, I’m not sure it’s worth $45. I’m keeping it only because I got it on sale— the zipper and zipper closure are completely different materials. The zipper itself is a nice, shiny rose gold— actually metal. The closure, however, is a dark solid gold colored plastic material. They don’t match super great but from a normal distance it’s not super noticeable. I couldn’t tell from the product photos that they weren’t the same material so I’m not super happy about that, I expected them both to be metal. It’s disappointing. I haven’t washed it yet so I’m not sure how it holds up but the material feels really structured and sturdy. I’d recommend if you can get it on sale for $30 or a little less. I got the medium and it fits very well— I typically like a looser fit. This I would say fits true to size in the chest and waist but the arms lengthwise are a little tight when fully outstretched if I’m using the thumb holes so I’d recommend sizing up.",11
Ryan Hysmith,So flattering and great quality!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29ETAQXTYZ8QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BD6QBJC2,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: PinkSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,I love the fit and quality of this sweatshirt!

Magdog,"Looks nice but no stretch, definitely size up",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VEZEJEFM2W03/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BD6QBJC2,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Color: Off-whiteSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I’m 5’8, 130lbs and got the medium. Definitely cut smaller than I thought it would be, not a lot of shoulder room. I think it might be too small after I wash it so I’ll probably exchange for a size up if I decide to keep it. I also have pretty long arms and when I reach out the sleeves are definitely too short.  The quality is nice and the cut is pretty flattering. I was surprised by the lack of stretch in the fabric, not quite as cozy as I hoped. I definitely like how it looks more than I like how it feels. The fabric is just kind of stiff, but might be better in a bigger size",4

The material is still thick like the scuba material is, neckline is the same. My only complaint is that the length of the arms seems a little short and I don’t have long arms. If I put both arms straight out in front of me the sleeves are about 2 inches or so from my wrists.

It fits me for the most part, particularly in the length and width of the torso part. The only issue I have with the jacket is the length of the arms. The jacket needs to be made where the sleeves are a solid 1""-1.25"" longer! When my arms are down by my side the length of the sleeves is fine. But when I raise my arms up, especially overhead, the sleeves become too short (and its not like I have long arms or something). I can't utilize the thumb holes for that reason.

Let's start with the positives. The style of this sweatshirt is trendy and fashionable. The crop length and stand collar give it a modern look that pairs well with high-waisted bottoms. I appreciate the inclusion of thumb holes, which add a cozy touch and keep the sleeves in place during movement. The pockets are also a handy feature for storing small items.  However, the material of the sweatshirt did not meet my comfort expectations. The fleece used feels rough and lacks the softness I typically associate with fleece fabrics. It falls short in terms of providing the cozy comfort and warmth I was hoping for in a sweatshirt.  The fit of the sweatshirt is generally decent. The crop length and relaxed cut offer a casual and relaxed look. The stand collar can be zipped up for extra warmth, and the overall fit is satisfactory. Functionality-wise, the thumb holes are a nice addition, but I found them to be a bit snug and uncomfortable after prolonged wear. In terms of durability, the sweatshirt has held up well through a few washes without significant fading or shrinking. Following the care instructions is essential to maintain its quality.  The price of the sweatshirt falls within a reasonable range.  The Women's Half Zip Pullover Fleece Stand Collar Crop Sweatshirt has its positive style elements, but there is room for improvement in terms of material comfort and fit. With some enhancements, this sweatshirt has the potential to be a great option for stylish and comfortable loungewear.",57

I bought the pitaya red (my favorite!) and the white to start. The colors are fantastic! Then I purchased the off-white because my 12yo decided she wanted the white. I’m 5’2”, about 150 and the medium fits great! It’s a shorter look, falls about the bottom of my hip bones and not too cropped. I willingly gave up the white because it seemed to be a smidge shorter than the pitaya red and off-white. My take on some of the reviews: The sleeves being too short (I don’t have that problem); the pullover is boxy (roomy sure, but I don’t feel boxed out) and the collar coming up too high when zipped all the way (while it does come up high, you can see that in the pictures and if you live in the northeast like I do, that’s a good thing!) The tag reads 50% cotton/poly blend - for me they seem to get a bit loose (and snuggly) between washes, and go back to original size after washing and drying on medium.  Overall I would totally recommend these - especially if you snag the lightening deals. I ended up getting all 3 on sale, so for $20-$30 they’re a great deal, I think $45 is too much (but I never like to pay full price for stuff).",32

This is a great alternative. Super warm and the cropped length is on trend. Pairing with Athleta  Ribbed Salutation joggers and a CRZ Yoga Pima Cotton Long sleeve shirt with rounded hem for a warm but put together althleisure look. At 5’6” and 118 lbs I sized up because I’m and inverted triangle and wanted to make sure the sweatshirt wasn’t too tight in the shoulders. Size chart reccomended Small and I purchased Medium. Glad I did because the sleeves are barely long enough. I don’t like using thumb holes so it’s ok for my needs but if you plan on using that feature you’d have to go up 2 sizes which makes the sweatshirt super boxy. The fit is why I only gave this item 4 stars. Seems like it is scaled to  shorter, more petite gals. Also, worth noting… the description lists this as a 70/30 cotton poly blend which is why is selected this brand over others, however the clothing tag says 50/50. Washed once and it has not pilled. Will update review if pilling occurs.",11
