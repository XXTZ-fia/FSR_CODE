The white top is ever so slightly see through, you might need to wear pasties underneath. I tried it on with silicone pasties but then the outline of the pasties was visible, so keep that in mind. Might have to rock the nips with this one. They are slightly snug to be 100% true to size imo. I am 5’4 115lbs with B cups and the small fit, but if I had bigger boobs it would be too tight.",

I wear high-waisted leggings most of the time that go to or just above my belly button. The tank top either hits right at my belly button or just above it so they go super well with the leggings. The material is a soft nylon that works great for high intensity workouts as well as low intensity walks. Not sticky when sweaty. It seems like it's double-lined too so it's not a flimsy shirt at all and it flatters because it's not a thin material that shows every curve and fold.
