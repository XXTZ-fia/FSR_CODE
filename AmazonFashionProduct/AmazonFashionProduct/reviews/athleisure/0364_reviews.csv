Kait Rosseter,So comfy!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10LC3O2F3JJP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNJB3XG1,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 19, 2024",Color: Black + Beige + Light BlueSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I love these tops! I wear them all the time to run errands, during light workouts, or just to be cozy around the house. They’re thick enough that I can wear a bra and you don’t see through but honestly I usually feel comfortable & supported enough to not even wear a bra. The colors look exactly like the photo, and fit is right at my belly button (I’m 5’11” with a longer torso so it may fit others a little longer). They’re higher quality than I expected for the price, don’t shrink when I wash & dry them. Highly recommend!",4
Kelsie A.,Perfect for mom bods,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37EDO3KTERIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNJB3XG1,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 26, 2024",Color: Black + Brown + BeigeSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,I love how comfy and cute these tops are.

Jordan D.,SUPER comfy but you need a specific body type,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CD7HY8U7CTLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNJB3XG1,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 8, 2024",Color: Black + Brown + BeigeSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"These tanks are literally SO comfortable and they don’t loosen up or anything after you wash them! I personally don’t put mine through the dryer (because it could cause little lint balls to stick) so they’re always form fitting! My only complaint is that you need a specific shoulder type to wear these for it to look good. My shoulders aren’t perfectly flat nor do they form a 90 degree angle, so the straps almost always fall down my shoulders. They just don’t fit well since my shoulders are curved downwards (which makes sense because of the square neckline). I’d also be careful because the bottom of the tanks have an elastic that helps keep it from looking too loose but mine tend to ride up my stomach under my bra. These are GREAT for sleeping and you don’t have to wear bras (i’m a b cup so take that with a grain of salt…) because they’re so form fitting without being constricting!",2
Ginny Drews,Love these!
