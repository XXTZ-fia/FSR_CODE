I'm 5'4"" and I wanted a less legging-look but still the comfort of the material and fit. I plan to get a few more in the same color. I purchased size M and it worked out great. It's comfortable like leggings yet a bit more dressy like pants. And best of all: the side pockets to fit my phone, wallet and car keys. I like to have my hands free while shopping and not having to wear a purse. Happy customer :). I highly recommend these pants.",8
