Amazon Customer,Again and again!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNJK745S9LV25/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09M8KR73Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 3, 2022",Size: SmallColor: #2-peacock Navy,Verified Purchase,"Amazed by the quality!! The material is buttery soft, stretchy and not see-thru. I order my normal size and they fit me perfect!! Really love the runched design on the butt, it separate the cheeks invisibly and make it pop and the runch just feels like the GYMSHARK WHITNEY leggings!! Best fall fashion in 2022!!",25
Belinda B.,Adorable !!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TQFRRZDL5VY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09M8KR73Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 18, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"Love this set! Comfortable, pretty colors. I do Ashtanga which is pretty vigorous & this works well. Soft, not sheer, and the fit is pretty accurate. I'm 5'2&1/2 & weigh 130 lbs. It's comfortable & I like my fitness clothes fairly snug, or it just gets in the way.  Don't really care about the butt ruching 😂 , but it doesn't bother me. Reasonable price. 💙",2
JordanM,"Great material, but if you’re in between sizes it’s a strange fit",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R113C9QUEH6ZLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09M8KR73Z,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"Fabric is really amazing & buttery soft. On a scale from soft and not buttery (1) at sweatpants level and buttery & soft 10 at LuLu Lemon level, these are between 8-9.  The cut is super cute in the shirt. I bought both these in medium and small to test out and I’m still not 100% happy with the bottoms. For the smalls, the butt scrunch looked great - not baggy and not noticeable - looked real. However the smalls were a little too snug for my liking - like if I wore them too long sitting I might get a belly ache from them. However they fit well everywhere else and the butt looked the best.  For the mediums the fit in the stomach felt great - like there was room to breathe and grow, and it didn’t hurt or feel uncomfortable when sitting. However, the butt scrunch looked like a TOTAL joke 😅 way too baggy, super noticeable, and not something I’d feel comfortable wearing out.  If I could get the waist size in the medium, with the booty of the small, then these would be perfect. Alas, I ended up keeping the small (hoping that as I get more fit in the mid section they feel better) because they were the ones I’d feel most comfortable leaving the house in, look wise.  Hope this helps anyone looking. If you’re in between sizes, buy both and rerun the one you don’t need. It’s too much of a guessing game with the fit of the fabric.",

Weymouth MA,Weird fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JEZ2522I9CLL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09M8KR73Z,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 28, 2022",Size: LargeColor: #2-volcano Ash,Verified Purchase,"I’m 5’9, 130lb. I ordered a large because I don’t like when things are too tight to feel good in, and a lot of the workout sets i order off amazon are more like Chinese sizes than American. Normally when I order workout clothes on amazon the larges surprisingly fit even though I’m not an over weight person. This one though was just way too big. The sleeves on the arms flared out because of how big it was and it was super loose on my torso…which typically I don’t even mind. What really bothered me was how short the actual top was…it fit more like a bra than a shirt. I tried it on with a sports bra underneath and the top was so short that you could visibly see my bra underneath. Sizes/proportions of the top are just really odd. Large bottoms were big too as the crotch was super baggy and gave me bad camel toe but it seemed like it would’ve done that even with the medium for the proportions again are just weirdly made. Honest review.",
Amazon Customer,Well worth it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JJ6CPIFV7L4V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09M8KR73Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 10, 2022",Size: LargeColor: #2-black,Verified Purchase,"I’m really happy with this set for many of reasons. Light weight material that is buttery soft! Form fitting and flattering without being too tight or feeling squished. I have long legs (I’m 5’7) and thicker thighs (around 165 pounds) and Ive always had a problem with biker shorts riding up or just squeezing my thighs where the short ends. I got a LARGE. These don’t do that! The butt scrunch isn’t too much either to where it just feels like a wedgy lol (I’m not a fan of butt scrunch bottoms) Now up top, I’m quite flat so I was worried the large top would look baggy but it doesn’t. But it’s not too tight either. To me it’s perfect, but I believe would be tight on someone who’s more blessed with a bigger chest! Will be ordering in other colors!",5

I ordered the long and short set in the grey because sometimes I like to wear the long pants with the short sleeve shirt. I'm 5'2 126 lbs and I am wearing a small in the pictures. I also ordered the black in a medium because I feel like the small is kind of tight but the medium is too big on me. The medium fits better at first but stretches out during my work out. The top in the medium is also very loose on the bottom band. I posted pics in different lighting so you guys can see what the color really looks like. The locker room pic is the most accurate for the color because I am using ring light for the others. My only complaint is that the arm holes are tight but I have big arms so that might be a personal problem lol.,7

Also, I have very wide hips and a very small waist so they fit that curvy body shape well. The waist on the leggings is very tight, which I like, so the leggings don't fall down. If you have a straighter shape then they may feel too tight at the waist. The color is nice, too. The only thing I don't like is that although they are not see-through, they do show the pantyline really easily, even if you wear super thin synthetic underwear that supposedly never shows a pantyline. The only underwear you can really wear with these is a thong.",
Maria,I’d buy again,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2K3UBM6E7S144/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09M8KR73Z,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 9, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: #1-long Volcano Ash,Verified Purchase,I measured from my navel 40” and 51 “ hips/buttocks my thighs are 31” Good for gym workout outs but if you sweat heavily it does seep through I never sweated through clothes before but this material is thinner than anything  I’ve bought before. Nice soft to touch and and so far not weirdly not  see through. I’ve tested pants with no underwear and everyone said they don’t see anything. Don’t use pants for running it’s slips down better use for  gym and yoga only.  The shirt is nice feels not tight for me but my arms measure at 13.75” .,2

This didn't bother me. What did kind of bother me was that it fits snugger than I thought and I had already sized up. Maybe I'm just bigger than I think I am and that's okay cos I plan to lose weight. I guess the real downside is there's no pockets at all.
