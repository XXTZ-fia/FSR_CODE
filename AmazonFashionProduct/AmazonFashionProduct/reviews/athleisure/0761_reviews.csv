The quality is great as it feels durable but not stiff, and the super soft material makes it so comfortable to wear all day. The fit is true to size, so I didn’t have to deal with annoying returns or exchanges. Whether I’m lounging at home, running errands, or hitting the gym, this is my go to option while feeling relaxed. Honestly, it’s soft and comfortable enough to sleep in too!",

I sometimes wear the shirt without the pants as it's a nice shirt for going out. I wear the pants around the house since I work at home and they're super comfortable for lounging. The XL size fits perfect and true to size. The material appears to be well made and stitching is great. Highly recommend. Very comfortable.,

He throws on his favorite sneakers and he likes the fact that it’s a little warm, especially since it’s getting pretty chilly here.this will make a great gift for your husband or boyfriend or dad and it washes very well.",

The fit is great; it's loose but not baggy, which is great- no one will be staring at your package. The fabric is on the thinner side, so this is not a cold weather set. We ordered it in his usual size 2X, and the fit is great, he has plenty of room for free movement. He wears it when he runs, and now that it's getting colder he's able to wear thermals underneath without it becoming bulky looking.",

The material was not of expected quality and I don’t think that pants that thin are practical for most men. If you are expecting a true tracksuit with a sweater and sweatpants this is not that.,

So, this isn’t exactly what I would call “jogger” material. The material is closer to linen than anything else. I don’t really care for the overall feeling of the material. It’s not itchy or anything. It’s just not very soft. The shirt isn’t too fitting. For my long torso, it’s not quite long enough to fit. The sleeves are long enough for my arms, which I appreciate. The pants are a good length. The outfit, as a whole, works well enough. It’s just not a “jogger.” It’s also not very soft or comfortable.",

The color is pretty much like the picture shows and I like the button up and the collar and the sewing is not bad at all really decently manufactured especially for the price range it would be hard to find a track suit or pj's at this price and quality and I will be using these as pajamas for the most part and just lounging around in comfort but if I need to run to the store or pick up someone then I'll be ready at all times. I only subtract a star but would give it 4.5 if possible, for the thinness.",

These are the perfect solution for him as he can keep something nice and soft on his sensitive skin AND continue to look professional and true to the standard of his employer. The polo style shirt is also nice to wear under his uniform shirt on chilly days- the long sleeves give him just enough protection to spend time in the freezer without causing him to over-heat.",

Great for traveling as it is lightweight, especially if you need pajamas. The thin fabric makes it soft and breathable. However, like many of the modal / microfiber type of fabrics - after steaming and close inspection there is already minor pilling on the fabric and some little balls forming. In my experience this leads inevitably to a short lifespan.",
