Alixie J,"Love these leggings, SO SOFT!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DCOB8NOG2PS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YYSC22N,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"These leggings are so stinking soft! I love them. I’ve had them for years, and bought another pair not too long ago, the quality is the same which I love. My older pairs have developed holes but they are used a lot. These are comfy sweats/joggers, not great for exercise if you’re tryna keep cool. They loosen up a bunch after some washes. I like that they’re long. I’m 5’8” and they actually go down to my ankles! I got them as a Christmas gift, best Christmas pajamas ever!",14
Star Hicks,SUPER SOFT!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25UX8L36I9W9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YYSC22N,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 6, 2024",Color: OliveSize: 2X,Verified Purchase,I ordered 2 different designs of these pants. The green ones are crazy soft and comfy!! The ones with a pattern are not as soft but they are still very comfy. The fit is fantastic too!! I'm a 2x and kinda short and these pants are pretty long in a 2x but they can be scrunched down and not look terrible. I like them a lot and will probably order more in the future if they end up being pretty durable.,11
Amazon Customer,Pilling but Very Comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K5ED3QI2G7HF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YYSC22N,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 4, 2024",Color: BlackSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"After a little less than a year of about once a week use, the thighs ripped since I have thick thighs. They are my favorite pants to wear since they are comfortable and soft. (I consistently wear them to sleep because they are so comfy!) Cat hair sticks to it very well, but it gets out in the wash. The pockets are too small as my phone and other items constantly fall out. There is pilling if you have thighs that rub together. Overall, despite all of the issues, I do love these pants. I just bought three more since they have a great price. They fit well, I am an XL being 5'3"" and 220lbs.  Warning, The Charcoal Grey color turns out to be a bit like a navy blue, but the black is black!",16

Very comfy. Plenty long enough. Likely wont shrink. You know the kind of leggings that are super soft with the sort of “moleskin” feel? That’s what these are made of. These are loose fit super soft leggings with the cut of a woman’s jogging pant. Originally I bought the I’m 5’10.5” & 225lbs. I have a proportionate build. I’m in between (stretch) jeans sizes 16-18 right now. Originally I bought these in XL. It fit like slightly loose leggings. I returned them for the XXL and they’re perfect. If you’re close to being the next size then go with that bigger one.,8
Jillian R,CAREFUL OF SOLIDS IN STRAIGHT-LEG STYLE (if you're not tiny) THEY'RE AMAZING! (not athleisure wear!),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27Q6J4BA47MVH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YYSC22N,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2020",Color: Leopard MuseSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I found this brand RANDOMLY, because someone was selling these pj pants on a resale site.  They looked comfy so I was happy to find them on Amazon for a great price. (I hate spending a ton of money on pj's that I'm only going to wear at home, unless they're ""special sexy pjs"" you know?)I liked the standard straight-leg ones, but I LOVE leopard and they didn't have my size in leopard, so I grabbed the jogger style, never tried joggers before but I took a chance, who cares, they're returnable and I'm wearing them inside my home! I got the leopard joggers and the straight-leg pants in grey camo and burgundy.  I tried on the camo as soon as they came and I was IN LOVE.  They are SO soft and comfortable.. I don't wake up hot in the night, so they're SO soft, almost feel like a SUPER THIN fleece (but I don't want you to misunderstand, they are NOT what we would usually describe a fleece pj pant.) They're DEF Pj pants, not athleisure wear or anything, THESE ARE FOR AT HOME PEOPLE!! lol. Thrilled with my purchase!!.... so far.....A few days later I tried the joggers on, LOVE! It's a different style for me and a little less ""fleece-y"" feeling but easy to wear for anyone considering trying joggers!  I waited a while (assuming I was keeping all these and maybe even buying MORE,) but then I put the burgundy pair on one evening, (same style as the grey camo I bought, if you recall...) They were the same thing, comfy, same material, but OMG THEY WERE HORRIBLY UNFLATTERING!! SO SO UNFLATTERING THAT I WOULD NOT WEAR THEM IN MY HOUSE IN FRONT OF MY FAMILY.  It was AWFUL.  I don't want to offend anyone, but they really just made things look a lot worse on me! I was so sad, but I recently had a similar experience with leggings, the printed ones looked great but the solids showed every single imperfection.  I realized the SOLID COLOR (burgundy vs the grey camo print,) probably because its such a thin soft material, SHOWED EVERY SINGLE LUMP, BUMP, SKIN IMPERFECTION, WHATEVER ...ETC! If you are an xs-s, or you're very very toned and fit, or have no cellulite or dimples or skin imperfections-- you may be completely fine with a solid color! But for many of us that might not be the case, and the prints are 100% a great choice if you fit into that category!  (Don't get me wrong, It's not the company's fault I have recently gained weight or that I am not slimmer or more toned.. it's mine! I just want to encourage others to select the best color for them so they are happy with their purchase too and feel comfortable, not discouraged or bad about themselves because of some silly pj pants!!)---> SO A STRONG RECOMMENDATION TO OTHERS BEFORE SELECTING COLORS TO PURCHASE: if you have ANY skin issues you don't want shown, or (ACTUALLY) ACCENTUATED, (think like--back of your thighs? on your bum? cellulite, anything like that..) I WOULD 100% ORDER THE PRINTS!  THEY HAVE A TON OF OPTIONS FOR THE PRINTS AND THEY'RE SUPER CUTE (I found it so hard to choose initially!) SO YOU'RE NOT MISSING OUT BY NOT GETTING THE SOLID COLORS! The grey camo isn't unflattering on me AT ALL! I love them! They honestly look great!  The joggers are excellent too! The joggers are actually a lot looser on me than the straight legged pants so I'm not sure if the solid joggers would be as much of an issue but I'm not going to take the chance.  I bought XL, could have got away with L, but I wanted a really loose fit for sleeping and comfort, (and even still the burgundy showed everything, so they weren't just too tight on me..) I returned the burgundy and am going to grab another print because I love them so much. Might grab a few to go with my nieces and nephews x-mas presents.  After washing they seem to hold up fine!  It's rare sweatpants or pj pants are long enough on me, not sure why because I'm only 5'6"" but for some reason casual sweat and pj pants  (HELLO OLD NAVY?! WHAT THE HECK?) seem to be SO short, which I hate! These ARE NOT SHORT! They're nice and long. I dried them in the dryer too and they didn't shrink up on me in the length.  Just NOTE: before they go in the dryer, TIE A KNOT ON THE DRAW STRING ON EACH END OF THE STRING WHILE THE STRING IS IN THE PANTS OR DOUBLE KNOT THEM VERY VERY TIGHTLY!  Once they went through the dryer I was searching for the string to pull back through the waist of the pants, I put a knot on each end (like comes standard on many sweats and no more issues with that.All in all they're a great price and a great pant, I think they're my new go to pj pants! Cheaper and better hold-up quality than the pj pants in most of the big box stores...just buy the prints if you're concerned about being self conscious especially with the straight legged style... I promise you'll thank me!!! ;).Sorry for the long review but I hope this gives potential customers as much information as possible to purchase pants you'll be able to enjoy!!!",344

They are soft, and thicker than a lot of joggers, which is great for this cool weather. I’m not normally a camo person, but I do love these in gray camo. One thing I particularly like about these is that the length is longer than a lot of joggers (which just hit my ankle with no room to spare). These have plenty of length.  I am 5’6 1/2” and 200 lbs, and I ordered the 1X, the fit is perfect!  The only reason I took one star off is because the left pocket is not sewn together on the inside, so there’s a 4” gap, so I am unable to use that pocket. I’ll have to remember to put my phone in the right pocket. I’m already wearing them, and I love them so much. I’m not taking them off to return them. So I will deal with the unfinished pocket.",

Lastly, the pockets are pathetically small.  It’s a feat of stretching and pulling to get one’s phone into a pocket and even then, it is not a secure fit.

And I thought Amazon had the same great price a return and a return is easier. So I ordered these and they feel amazing they are so soft it feels like ur naked the fit is great I order a little bigger in women's b/c i find they always fit tighter and I prefer a slightly looser fit. And they were exactly that, I often wish they are looser in the thigh area and not so much the ankle area so I would give them a 4 1/2 stars on that front, so I might even go down a size. Despite that they are absolutely perfect and the colors were a tiny bit deeper which I also liked a lot I am going to get more colors. I wish they had a nice khaki. over all super happy with purchase.",
