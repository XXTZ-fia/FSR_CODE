I love how the back design drapes down diagonally over my hips while exposing a bit of my lower back without being too revealing (e.g., I personally don't like showing my sports bra, and this top is low enough to hide your sports bra). The material is GREAT for intense cardio if you don't mind the sweat darkening the fabric a bit in the spots where you sweat, but (1) it dries quickly (maybe a little gross for some of you) and (2) you certainly don't feel drenched in sweat (I do boxing, and this top is gym/family-friendly and workout-friendly!). Would love this same design in a different fabric, perhaps, but I'm satisfied, nonetheless. I certainly love how I look in it! Thank you so much for crafting such a lovely belonging.",

I purchased a large or one size up in order to have a bit of looseness this summer.  Also nice to have a looser top for summer that would then be slightly longer as to wear with leggings. Sadly this top fit like it was a size to small as it hugged my torso, the sleeves were tight as well as were uncomfortably short, feeling more like a “capped sleeve”  and fitting tight under the arms  Then to be the end all, the body length wasn’t near long enough , though II had ordered one size larger so that I’d feel a little more covered when wearing leggings!!!This top is so well made with a nice fabric if I were to buy it again I’d go up TWO sizes.So I’d you still want  this top  and don’t mind it feeling and looking very fitted, then order top two larger!!!",5

Even when wearing a neutral color, you can see the bra/sports bra. Because it's a crop and open back, you can't wear a tank under it to hide the bra. I use this as a workout top (as it's intended for) but don't wear it out because it's very see through and I'd prefer to look more coordinated (and let's be honest, who ever has time to match their sports bra to their top lol). The plus sides are it's very light weight, soft, and flowy. I never overheat when working out in this top at home. I love the open back because it's breezy and offers ventilation. I would be open to trying another color to see how sheer the fabric is with a darker color (I purchased pink for reference).",

My arms and shoulders are what tend to be my problem area when it comes to clothes. Items may fit everywhere fine, but then it’s tight in my arms and shoulders. But this works great because of how stretchy and soft it is. I was debating between the large and medium and I’m glad I got the medium. I’m obsessed with the back!  The ONLY thing I’m bummed about is the light blue is EVER so slightly more deep than in the picture. It’s def still a light blue, but it’s not quite as baby light pastel blue as the image.

The feel of the shirt is very soft and light, as expected.  It would be comfortable if fitting, but I don't think would really be flattering if rolls of fat or skin pour through.
