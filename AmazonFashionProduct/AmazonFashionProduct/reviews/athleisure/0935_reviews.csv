It fits me perfect and has a little warmth to it it’s not too think or too thick! I’m 5’1 and weigh 150 and I ordered an extra large. You can run errands in it or wear around the house as a lounger!  I ordered the dark gray and I love the color with the white stripes down the leg! I washed it in cold water and hung the top to dry but put the pants in dryer and they washed and dried well and didn’t shrink. Pants have pockets, outfit has a lil stretch to it, not see through and not thin.",6
donna nunamaker,Fun Casual anytime set,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S56I5GX9D0HG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B099K2ZM68,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2024",Color: 2a-blackSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,I like this so much I ordered a solid black without the stripes .. I think it will be fun with cute jewelry The fit was perfect and the fabric very comfortable . I just am a little Leary of drying in case of shrinkage .. I’ll re-evaluate once I wash it. I bought this black with white stripes for a great price and almost didn’t order the solid bc of the increase in price,14
Mandie,"Cute and comfy , I would size up",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPHR2VQQ5OBI3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B099K2ZM68,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 2, 2024",Color: 2a-blackSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"I had this saved for later for a few months, I was unsure based on some reviews. I finally figured I'd just take a chance.  I think it's polyester mostly, I'm not a huge fan of the fabric. I wish it were cotton. But all of that is stated in the description so I was aware! I think after a couple washes it would get softer and the fabric would feel better. That's just personal, I'm not a huge fan of the way polyester feels on the skin.  I've seen people say they wouldn't wear it in public, the fabric quality etc. Maybe they have different patches because mine is very thick, it's not see through whatsoever. I would have no problem wearing this in public.  I average size 18 and I ordered 2x. It fits nicely. It does fit more like a fitted jogger. I think I would have sized up to a 3X just to have a more roomy fit, and to account for if there's any shrinkage in the wash.  Overall I really like this and I think I would order another set again. I live in a climate that doesn't get super cold in the winter, but it can be in the '30s in the mornings. It's nice to have an option that I feel a little more put together to do school drop offs, morning errands etc.",44

It’s very light weight and comfortable. The fabric isn’t as soft as I would like it to be, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I guess on some level you can expect that with a 95% polyester fabric. I’m hoping it will soften with a few washes. I’m 5’6 and about165 lbs I ordered a M and it works well for me. The top is a bit more fitted than the bottoms, so if you are a bigger chested lady, you may want to size up. I’m a 36 DD for reference. I would recommend overall.",2

Initially, I got them to sleep in during the cooler months, but as stated -- a little scratchy. They would be absolutely fine wearing an under layer.  As I am moving from the Deep South (US) to the Frozen North (again) I'm keeping them. They washed well enough; I put them in both washer and dryer and there was slight pilling on the pants but that was there *before* they hit the machines. After only 2 wears.

Let's  start with the pros: the bottoms great fit, the material thickness is thin, has nice deep pockets. Thankfully. It is wrinkle resistance from what I can see the cons: this material is itchy to me, that's a bit annoying.The sleeves are tight around the forearms and that's strange to me. I have big arms but it's only tight in the forearm areas so I can't pull them up. Overall it's  alright. Definitely would not get another pair.
