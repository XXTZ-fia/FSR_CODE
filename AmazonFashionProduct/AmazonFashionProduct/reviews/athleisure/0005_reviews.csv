When I first got it, it was slightly too big. It gapped at my armpits, and hung down too low. I was going to return it, but I really liked the color, and decided to keep it. I gave it four stars because it does shrink. It’s a totally different shirt once you wash it. It will shrink up quite a bit, and the feel of it changes. It feels like a cheap polyester shirt out of the bag, but after you wash and dry it, it feels and lays soft like cotton. It is a thin, slightly clingy material. I cannot see my sports bra color through the material, but I can definitely see the shape. It will show some of your curves if you have any you like to normally hide. I like how it gathers over the butt from the cross over in the back.",3
