Dawn,Comfy and nice color,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CIJILQTZ4ZZD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM7J9RCC,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 19, 2024",Size: 10-12Color: Shadow,Verified Purchase,"These pants are nice and soft. I weigh 60 pounds and I’m 4’6”. They do pill after a few washes, but otherwise they’re nicely made. They aren’t quite silky, but they aren’t fully cotton like a typical yoga pant. I like that these aren’t fitted to my leg. They are slightly long for me (I have a 24” inseam if that helps others).",
