Bought to wear at fitness classes in cold studios, but I find myself wearing it out and about almost every day.

They are toasty warm, which is awesome, and the style is cute.  I don't know why they bothered with the thumb holes, though, because the sleeves are just long enough as regular sleeves.  If I try to use the thumb holes, the sleeves are stretched and it just looks silly.  I might just stitch them up altogether so there's no little slit there (although I mostly just forget they're there).  I would love for them to hang down just a couple of inches longer, but they're still really great with leggings.  I ordered them in 3 colors (purple, blue, charcoal) and love them all.  My mom even ordered some after she saw me in mine.  For sizing reference, I ordered a M (which fit me perfectly) and I'm 5'8"", 138/slender build not busty.",7

I almost 5’11 and about 145. I ordered the small and am sooo happy I did. I normally wear a medium or sometimes large but wanted a slightly fitted look and it’s perfect, I wouldn’t mind if it were a bit smaller even. But as far as length, I am long in the torso and it hits low on my but, and that’s hard to find. The fabric is a lightweight fleece on the inside but so cozy. Just get it, you won’t be sorry",6

At first I had decided before I got it that I better love it for the price and it did not disappoint. Ive had this for a while and I wash and wash it and I have not experienced pilling at all so I'm not really sure why other reviewers have. Mine comes out of the washer/dryer looking new every time. I will most likely get another soon.",6
