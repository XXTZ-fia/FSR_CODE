With the medium, the sleeves came to my wrists but were slightly too short to comfortably use the thumbholes (if you don't plan on using the thumbholes you'll be fine). Ultimately, I'm very happy that I went with the large. It's super comfy and cozy. So far I've washed this twice on the cold cycle, then I laid flat to dry to minimize shrinkage. So far it's holding up well.",4
