Bertis-mae,The pants are really satin and soft,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CB78E2XF1NGT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08T5WC1FC,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 8, 2024",Size: X-SmallColor: Silver,Verified Purchase,"I like that the pants are satin and soft, easily washable in cold water.  I was afraid there would be streaks after washing, but happily, no streaks.  The fit is perfect.  I am slim and purchased size small.  Coloring is almost silver which is what I wanted.  These pants can be worn with heels with nice blouse as dress-up or with sneakers and tee as dress-down.The only problem I had was that the delivery was a day later than originally stated.  I bought these pants for a special occasion and needed right away.  Since they did not arrive until a day later than I was expecting to receive them, I was afraid I would have to wear some pants from my closet.  But luckily they were delivered approximately an hour before I needed to leave for the event.  Thank goodness!  All I needed to do was use a warm iron to get rid of the wrinkles and they looked great.",5
