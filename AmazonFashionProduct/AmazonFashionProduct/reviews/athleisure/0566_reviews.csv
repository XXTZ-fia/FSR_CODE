Didn’t shrink when washed.  Thick material, pretty heavy and warm, not really for warmer weather.  Only downside is that the seams on the arms inside are kind of thick and you can feel them when moving your arms.  I don’t mind, but those with tactile issues may need to avoid or wear a long sleeved t-shirt underneath.",2

I ordered a size large to be able to wear this as a layering piece for an upcoming overseas trip so I wanted it to be large enough to fit over at worst case a light sweater even. This was perfect. It’s baggy enough to do that, be cozy on the plane and it doesn’t swallow me up or look unflattering. It washed well on warm and didn’t shrink. If I were to buy this as my primary shirt or didn’t want it too baggy I’d probably order a medium and who knows maybe it might have been large enough anyway but I’m happy with the size I chose. At this price I’d consider purchasing another color even as this won’t take up much room in the suitcase either.",7

The Dokotoo Womens Oversized Hoodie is the perfect answer. This is a waffle knit hoodie that has draw strings and a pocket. It is a straight cut, and doesn't nip in at the waist. Very comfortable. It washes easily and you can hang it to dry or put it in the dryer on low. It is very soft and snuggly. Would recommend.",

M. Hill,Oversize Hoodie Waffle Weave Fabric,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I9DOK8C5HV7Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6V2WG14,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 30, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Blue,,"The fine waffle weave fabric used for this pull-on hoodie is between a light and medium weight, has a slightly rough feel and adds a distinctive look from the usual sweatshirt material. It is light enough that the material drapes well and moves with the wearer so it doesn’t look bulky. The fabric is 75 percent polyester and 25 percent cotton.  It is definitely over-size so an excellent choice when layering during cooler months or if a looser fit is preferred. The medium size fits as expected and the dark blue is obviously blue not black and it looks good when worn with a number of other colors. The hood has a drawstring and there is a large pouch pocket on the front.  The cuffs are made of ribbed material so they should stay if pushed up on the arm. The garment is 2 inches longer in the back and there are side seam splits to allow ease of movement and they are 6 inches length at the front and 8 at the back. Laundry care is machine wash in warm water, do not bleach or tumble dry so dry flat or dry on a line. A steam iron set on low may be used.",

I ordered the hoodie in a 2 x- which is the size I wear right now and it fit wonderfully. I have been looking for a baggier hoodie and finally- this one was perfect! However know that it is baggy enough to still look good.  I highly recommend this hoodie as it is quality made of thicker material and fits wonderfully.
