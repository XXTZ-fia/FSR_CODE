I washed it in cold water, and hung to dry, and it looked good as new. Overall, I'd recommend this top.",3

Vivian Tran,SIZE UP if you have wide shoulders/back!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2H8HMOXJFP2VW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BD82Z2Z8,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 11, 2023",Color: Dandelion BrownSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I really wanted to love this long sleeve crop top. The top itself is SO flattering and there are so many cute colorways. I'm 117 lbs, 5'1"", 34B and regularly work out so my arms, back and shoulders are a little bit wider than average. I've tried this top in the colors black, mink, and dandelion brown so far. At first, I tried the black in my normal size small which was way too tight in the chest. I felt like my torso and arms could barely breathe, so I returned it for a medium in the same color. The medium fit perfectly in the chest, but the arms were still too tight and since the fabric is thick, it gets very warm very fast. Next, I tried the color mink because I figured that lighter colors might be a little more giving in the fabric (darker dyes tend to be more stiff/tight-fitting). The medium size mink was basically perfect, but the color wasn't flattering on me since I have pale, yellow-toned skin. The fabric of the mink color is way more stretchy, soft, and breathable. Last, I tried my chances again and purchased the dandelion brown in medium, but this basically had the same problem as the black fabric.  EDIT: Since writing this review, I have tried on the black top in a size large and have found this size to be the most comfortable for my wider shoulders and muscular arms. For some reason, the black fabric in a size large also feels a bit thinner, making it more soft and stretchy than the size medium I tried on previously. Even though the chest doesn't give as much of a ""push-up"" effect, I still prefer the size large because I could stack double bra pads in the top if I wanted to to fill out the chest a bit more and its not noticeable at all! Would totally recommend sizing up even 2 sizes if you have a muscular build and can't tolerate tightness in the arms.",27

Going to see if they have one more size up although I’ve never had to order a xxl or 1x/2x before so I would say this runs very small.,3

The material of this workout top is incredibly soft and comfortable, and it feels like a snuggly hug while I'm working out.  As a woman with a smaller chest, I was initially worried about the low v twist design on the front. However, the top provides great coverage and even adds a bit of fullness with the non-excessive padding. I feel confident and stylish wearing it during my workouts.  My only concern is that I wouldn't wear this top on days when I'm doing workouts that require a lot of arm motions. I found that the top rides up a bit, and I need to constantly adjust it after putting both of my arms up. But to be honest, this top is so cute that I would wear it as a casual outfit outside of the gym.  Overall, I highly recommend this top for anyone looking to add some fun and style to their workout wardrobe. It's a risk worth taking for the extra motivation at the gym!",56
