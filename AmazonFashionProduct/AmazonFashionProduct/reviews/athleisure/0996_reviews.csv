These are even a little looser around the waist, but not falling off or anything. I like the high waist/no muffin top and it’s not squeezing my tummy either. I would give these a 4.5/5 honestly though because they are shorter than I would have liked (but I have pretty long legs) but it’s okay, they’re more of an ankle length 7/8 jogger. Not loose around the legs though like a typical jogger. Will use for Zumba and pilates type of classes at the gym, but they also are nice enough to wear out casually.",3

I'm 5'6 and they hit just above the ankle, which I like. They're relaxed in the legs but not the the point of being Hammer pants. They actually have more of a tailored look. The waistband is high and not restrictive. It rolled down a bit when I was sitting, but that was easy to fix-- I'd rather have that than a too-tight waistband that digs in or gives me extra rolls around my midsection. The shiny animal print is SO CUUUUUUTE! Can definitely dress them up or down. This morning I wore them out with a collared shirt and sweater, and this afternoon I'm wearing them around the house with a black half-zip sweatshirt. Both look great. It's below freezing in Chicago today, and with a long coat they're fine for going from your car to a building and back. Would wear for running a few errands, but not for extended time outside (like walking from the train to work). I'm hoping these will be a new staple for Fall/Winter/Spring, and maybe on less hot summer days.",2
