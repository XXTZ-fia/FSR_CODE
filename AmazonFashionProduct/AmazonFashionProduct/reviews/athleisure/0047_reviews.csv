Haley Taylor,I keep coming back for more!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MB4DKAYJGXYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D269J7GH,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 25, 2024",Color: Heather Grey Short-sleeved SetSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"Best set I've found. I want it in every color because of how comfy and flattering it is. I have 3 colors in this set and the material is the best: breathable, stretchy, and the most amazing fit. I wear them separately all the time especially the tops with other bottoms because they're genuinely the most flattering tops I own, they make me feel so beautiful and hug all the right places. More than worth the price in my opinion I love this set so much and I want more!!",7

Im 5'3 and normally weight 170 but now I'm 200 pounds because of belly and bloating. Im 9 months pregnant and ordered these to wear during and after pregnancy. It's true to color. Material is SO stretchy, not baggy, buttery soft, breathable, not see through. I love that it's ever so slightly ribbed so cat/dog hair is easy to get off. Im getting this in every color. I live in this now.",14
Noelle,My favorite lounge pants ever 😩,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PSSKB41316UT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D269J7GH,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 21, 2024",Color: Dark Gray Short-sleeved SetSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,These are so comfortable!! And are now my favorite lounge set ever. It’s also versatile. The shirt and pants each on their own are nice and I’ve worn the shirt as a regular t shirt with jeans. The pants are so comfy and thick enough where they don’t show every imperfection and cellulite but thin enough so they’re not hot. I ordered darker colors so I have not had any issue with being see through. Think Victoria secret pink fold over pants but in a thicker jersey material. They have stretch but haven’t stretched out and have washed super well. I haven’t noticed any pulling except between the thighs. If ya know ya know. I let them line dry because I do not want them to get smaller. For reference I am 5’2” around 145 lb and ordered a medium. I think they’re a good value and I got them on sale. The fit is good. I have mom pooch and it’s flattering.  I loved it so much after I first tried it on I immediately ordered the black set but that material seems a little more rigid to me. And the shirt feels shorter. It’s still a nice set but the gray is my fave. Also I’m a true/cool summer the gray is in line with dark charcoals which is ideal for that color palette.  Overall good value and if you’re looking for a comfy lounge set for fall months you can wear in the house-this is it!,42

You'll be able to see your panty line with just regular underwear. It'll definitely also become see through with enough stretch.

Also not see through like I thought it would be. It’s so cute and simple and very flattering. For reference I’m 5’8 and 216lbs  and ordered a medium for a more form fitting look. However, whatever you do, don’t be like me and dry the pants. They definitely shrink (length wise), but still so worth it.",14

I weigh around 165 and am 5'1'' and ordered a large. It was not too tight, which I really liked because I cannot stand when pants cut into my love handles. I like material that just sits against my skin and that's exactly what these pants did. The shirt was longer than most crop tops, which I also really liked since I have a longer torso, so it did not end up right under my boobs, like most crop tops do. The material is very soft, and the pants have a nice stretch to them.",

I’ve purchased several clothes off Amazon and find stuff to not fit as well as I had hoped. I’m 5’1 and about 115lbs. I ordered my usual size (small) and it fit very well. Definitely true to size. The quality was impressive too, but that could just be because I assumed it’d be super thin. It’s got some thickness to it, but not too much. Shouldn’t tear easy. The only thing I’m slightly bothered by is that the pink set is slightly see through. I’m still going to wear it either way. It’s also a smidge too long, but nothing a chunky sneaker/slipper can’t fix. Haven’t washed it yet though!",

I’m a sweaty girl, and if I were to be sitting in the car with these leggings with the seat heater on… well it would probably look like I peed myself if you know what I mean.

You can’t see the outline of every little line but it’s very..not thin, but revealing. You can’t basically see the outline of the butt lines (even the middle line) and while it’s such a comfy material, I don’t know if I would wear this out. A large may fit different.
