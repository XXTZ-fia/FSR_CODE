I already bought a second one and they arrived just in time for my workout. I will say, it runs small. I’m usually a small or xtra small but I was looking for something that fit comfortably and not super tight so I mega sized up. I ordered a large and found the fit of my dreams. It sits right at my belly button and my sleeves don’t exposed my pits. The fabric is stretchy and thick enough not to show your sports bra color but thin enough that it keeps you warm in winter and cool in summer.",10

The material is good quality and feels great on my skin after I get sweaty from my workout. I ordered another one in grey, which was also cute, but I was horrified to realize after my upper body workout that my sweat stains (armpits and even at the chest) were quite visible… if you order this, I recommend the darker colors or even white and staying away from the gray.
