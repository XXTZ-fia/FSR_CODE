Linda Hibberd,Runs small but larger size is beautiful,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R134H4ID4DYFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081W3R4W3,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 20, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Purple,Verified Purchase,"According too the size chart I needed a size medium (which is my normal size).  It was very form fitting and showed all my lumps and bumps.  It fit snuggly into my arm pits.  The picture shows the model wearing a longer and loose fitting shirt so I returned it for a large.  Fits just as I wanted it to and I love it.  The little peek-a-boo opening on the back is so cute.  You can see on the model that her little opening actually is baggy so she's obviously wearing a larger size than normal.  If you are in great shape and like a snug fit, order your correct size.  If you prefer not to show your imperfections, think about ordering up.  It's comfy, a cool fit and works well when I'm active.",4

Works great for workouts and wicks sweat away.  Does run a tad small, so order one size up if you don't want a snuggly fit. Looser around the middle, which is a plus for me.

Top, fabric and style are great, sizing way off. I am typically the same size across the board from most manufacturers, but this top I could barely get over my head. If you are an XS or SM you might be able to size up abt 3 sizes to get a top that will fit, but if you are a Med or larger then this top probably won't work for you because you need to size up 2-3 sizes and there are not enough size options left in the range to do that. On the plus side, I did order a similar closed back, t-shirt style top from this  same manufacturer in same size, which I'm looking forward to receiving as a different style may fit better. We'll see. Hope this helps.",9

In reality, it’s fuchsia/black, so heads up on that. Even though I’m not fond of this color, I kept it because I needed a workout shirt that day, and I’m ordering a second one. It’s comfy for working out, And the shape is fluttering because it flares a bit at the hips instead of cleaning to my tummy like other shirts. One thing to note is that the crisscross on the back does make a little bump on the upper spine, so if you do Pilates or something where you roll on your upper back, you will feel uncomfortable during that exercise.",9

I may go up to a 2X with my next one just for a little extra room when working out. But… I agree with many of the other reviews. The tag is super scratchy and I carefully cut it out immediately. I was very disappointed with the color. This seems to be consistent throughout other reviews with many of the colors. I ordered purple and it is absolutely not purple but very blue as shown in my picture where I laid the shirt over purple and royal blue t-shirts. That’s not a deal breaker for me though so overall I do like it and will order a few more. I just won’t count on the color until I see it.",6

I think they really are true to size cause the XXL was a bit lose. I think if I had gone with an XL it would have been a nice fitted work out shirt. The lose fit was still comfy too so I think I’ll keep it. I was worried about the fabric due to some review saying it poor or low quality but it’s actually quite nice. I have some dress shirts I use for work that are made from the same fabric and they’ve stood the test of time.
