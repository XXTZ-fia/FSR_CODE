They are well made and have very pretty colors that don't run in the wash or shrink. I did find that they run a bit large. I ordered the purple and magenta type color.  I like my shirts a bit long and these are that, and they are flowy. They are not too flowy for me, but just a little roomier than I expected. I think I could have gone a size down, but I always like the option of wearing another cute close fitting tank underneath, so I didn't try a smaller size. The shoulder area fits as expected and these are comfy tanks.",
sqrld,FAVORITE summer casual top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YN2HZ5BOR5VR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CL9F14M,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 17, 2023",Size: LargeColor: 1# Space Dye Black,Verified Purchase,"I love this item, bought the grey and want to purchase more! I've got a bit of leftover momma fluff around the belly- this tank has just right amount of looseness and length to be comfortable but not look sloppy. If you're like me it's hard to find tanks that fit good around the armpit area, this one's made perfectly- low enough for comfort but doesn't show your bra line. The fabric is lightweight, soft, easy to machine wash/dry. Received quickly and neatly packaged. Looks good with shorts, jeans and capris. Really can't say enough good things about it 🙂 Buy it, you'll be happy you did! Update - bought another one during sale ( green) it's almost a deep heather green. Love these tops! Get one or two or more!",8

Currently at 5'3"" and 145lbs my measurements are about 34DD bra/38.5"" bust - 30.5"" waist - 39"" hips.  I tried on this tank and it was so huge on me at a size large that it cut halfway across my bra so the lowest part hit the skin underneath the part where the cups connect.  The armholes weren't low in a cute way, like to show off a cool sports bra or lacy bralette if I ever happen to find one made with any actual support built-in.  They hit at my wait, and there was so much excess fabric on my body that they formed points from the folds while they were in the packaging still - it reminded me of looking like a flying squirrel.  I didn't mind the length from the waist down, as I had been hoping to wear this tank with legging and covering my butt was a bonus.  The width though wasn't an A-Line shape like the sizing suggests; rather the bottom width they list as the hip measurement, on the size Large tank in the shade of Grey I received was the same width for the entire tank top.  While I didn't take measurements before packaging up for return I know based on my experience with garment measurements and fitting that the bust measurement on mine was at least 10"" larger than my underbust, as a trust bust measurement would have been impossible to get with the straps being so long.  Other people my height or shorter have ordered this without issue so maybe mine just happened to sneak through QC without a proper inspection?

I had hoped that the straps and shape of the back of the top near the shoulders would be flattering- they weren't. In fact, it went in the opposite direction and just made me look very big. There are other tops somewhat similar to this on Amazon that were a real winner.

HIGHLY recommend this product!",
