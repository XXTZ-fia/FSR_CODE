I ordered it in a size S and it fits perfectly. The design is cute and modern and I love the way it looks. It is very comfortable to wear, thanks to its 4-way stretch, allowing me to move freely. The thumb holes are a great detail that adds functionality and style, keeping the sleeves in place during my activities. I would definitely recommend this jacket to anyone looking for a versatile piece for everyday or working out. It is a great addition to my wardrobe.",
Nicole M,Great fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1L5EDRD8B66AX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJDQDNMP,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 3, 2024",,,"I ordered this YITTY Active Women's UltraLuxe Cropped Full Zip Jacketwirh 4-Way-Stretch and Thumbholes specifically, because it said cropped and other jackets that I have of this style are much too long for me. When this jacket came, I was very impressed with the Size, as I felt that it ran very true to what it stated. The material feels strong and sturdy, but is quite lightweight. This is not an extremely warm, zip up jacket, but absolutely perfect for me to throw my gym clothes in the morning. The style of this jacket is an A+ for me and it even includes a zipper panel on the back of the jacket where you can place a key or credit card, etc. Wow, this jacket fits me everywhere for the most part. It is slightly long in the arms, but I have very short arms and most items Are long so this is not a deterrent for me. I also have a larger chest and do find that the zipper slides down left over my breasts and not zipped over them completely or completely under them. With everything said, I actually love this jacket and even though the zipper is not quite as strong as I would prefer, I do I think the style and fit are amazing. Really my only reason for deducting a star is how long the shipping took. I waited so long for this Jacket that I had actually forgotten that I had ordered it. If shipping would’ve been faster it would have been a no-brainer five star product for me.",3

It fits so so so well, feels nice, is flattering.. but yall get a different color than the dark gray because the SWEAT STAINS are wild!! Hahaha. I sweated a little after drinking my preworkout and felt stupid wearing this into the gym because of how obvious they were.. I couldn't risk working out in it when the stains were as crazy as they were before I even exercised hahaha but!! I still really love this. Just need a different color!",

It is not a flattering cut, however the material is very soft and nice. The zipper is high quality and runs very smoothly without any snagging. It might be for someone with a different body shape than mine.",

UE,Normally wear an XS but got an XL,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35W7Q7RF8S6UL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJDQDNMP,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 22, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Iconic Black,,Based on the sizing guide I got an XL although I normally wear an XS or S. Fors more like an S or M I’m not totally sure how this is sized.  It’s long sleeve yet can be form fitting. Once I run it through the wash I’ll update the review if anything changes.  The shape is nice and it has a really nice zipper too.,
Destiny Freeman,Great Lightweight Cropped Jacket,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPFYN9GGHDCOT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJDQDNMP,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 22, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Iconic Black,,"This jacket is so comfy yet so light. I'm not a runner, but I can see how useful it would be for runners due to the medium sized pocket in the lower back. The pocket isn't big enough for most phones, but it could hold ID, CC's &/or keys. The material feels the same as high quality leggings & it's the same color as black leggings (though my photo makes it appear lighter/more Grey but it's not). I also love the thumb holes so that it can partially cover your hands. Overall, it fits well & is a good quality jacket. It will definitely be one of my winter staples!",2
Thee W's,"Comfortable, Stretchy and Cute!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RB0JTSDW5YFVH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJDQDNMP,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 19, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Burgundy,,"Great brand! I absolutely love this cropped jacket! The burgundy color looks so much better in person. The front zipper is the same color as the jacket and the fabric is very stretchy, feels good on the skin, and the sweat wicks right off! It looks so good for working out and casual wear. The overall stitching is done very well, the pocket and seamless zipper on the back blend well into the jacket without adding bulk. My measurements are between two sizes and I went with the smaller size and it fits well! It is so comfortable to wear and the jacket has a light compression and smooths you out too! The crop length isn't too short either, it hits right at my navel. I love it!",
Ella,"Absolutely the best, 5-star is not enough",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BB15NA69MPV5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJDQDNMP,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 16, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Burgundy,,"This is absolutely the best. It fits true to size. The fabric is soft and super stretchy and feels amazing against the skin. It's perfect for workouts and all-day wear. The sleeves are long enough, which I love, and the thumbholes are flexible and comfortable during exercise. The burgundy color is gorgeous, and exactly as pictured. While it’s slightly longer than I expected for a cropped jacket, it still fits beautifully and flatters my figure. The full zip glides smoothly and isn’t tight or constrictive around the neck. The back pocket with a hidden zipper is a great feature for carrying small essentials. The overall quality is outstanding. I highly recommend it.",
Brittany,Fits beautifully,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EGLJQRST78D3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJDQDNMP,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 22, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Deep Navy,,Oh my this fit is fantastic. The arms are long enough so the thumb holes are not pulling in between your fingers. It fits snug but not tight. It has a small pocket in the back that can easily fit a standard iPhone and a key. The zipper is smooth. Definitely worth the 25$  This is true to size depending on how you like the fit of your running jacket. I am a 34D 28W 34H.,

Ruby rose,So nice and fitted,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1K7NFLH2H3WSC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJDQDNMP,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Heated Red,,"I’m usually a size medium but I ordered a small because I wanted a more fitted look and after looking at the size chart it seemed a small would be the right choice. Their medium is listed as a size 8 and a small is listed as a size 6. Anyways it fits perfect, exactly how I wanted I might’ve even been able to get away with x small but the small is perfect over a sports bra. Might be able to fit a tight shirt under but I haven’t tried. The material is so nice and the small gives me a fitted snatched look that wraps around my waist. I love the color as well, it’s as pictured",
