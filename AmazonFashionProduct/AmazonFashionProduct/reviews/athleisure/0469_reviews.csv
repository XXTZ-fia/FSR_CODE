Chamomile,"Very comfortable, very lightweight",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27XUW2Z44Z7G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08B59JT6F,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 18, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"These pants are cloud soft.  I am 5'3"" 125# and small fit perfectly.  I usually wear size 4-6, mostly 6.  These are lightweight (think summer), reasonably flattering (lots of drape -- see photo), and great for pajamas, light workouts, or lounging around the house or neighborhood.  Please note there are 2 styles represented here -- one with a waistband and drawstring, the other with no drawstring.  I bought the no-drawstring style.  Sadly, I only found three colors for this style -- blue, black, and gray.  I may still buy one more pair.  Edited to add:  Went back to buy more and they were out of stock.  Checked back on a regular basis -- no luck until today.  I immediately ordered 3 pairs.  These are so comfy, wash well in my front loading washer, and I hang dry them.  My first pair was black, and are not see through at all; I will update you on whether blue or gray are see-through (always a risk) but if so, I plan to make them PJs.  Edit:  I do not find blue or gray to be see-through but please note the material is thin.",13

At 5'2"" and 160lbs, the size large was WAY too long, with the waist right under my chest. They looked absolutely goofy on me; not at all flattering. While I know I'm overweight, I'm not terribly so, keeping myself pretty active, but because of my little belly these made me look pregnant. Not cute and not made for anyone who doesn't have a perfect body. No thanks.",40

JustMe&Dee,*Comparison of 3 pairs of these*,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18RVXEZXBZ7UR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08B59JT6F,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2022",,Verified Purchase,"I LIVE in comfy pants. So I was excited about these BUT I was so confused about what the actual material would be between each of the colors?! So I purchased 3 pairs of these pants to compare, and I’m hoping this helps someone else in deciding!!  I am 5’3” and 135lbs with thicker legs and booty. Pants I bought were: C Leopard Brown (small) C Leopard 1 (small) C Leopard (white, medium)  C Leopard 1: a brownish-gray color, cargo pockets on the outsides of both thighs AND pockets at both hips, elastic bunched at ankle ends and *100% VISCOUS* material! The advertised info is wrong for these as they are NOT the polyester/spandex blend. These pants are more starchy-feeling instead of being silky soft (though it might be softer after a wash) but I won’t keep these as comfy lounge pants. They would be super cute for wearing out in the spring/summertime. In general, viscous fabrics are breathable, but they are susceptible to shrinking with each wash and deteriorating more quickly. FIT: (SMALL) felt a little tight around my hips and butt at first but was comfy once I pulled the waist up. I’d keep these if I was looking for business casual style pants, but I’m on the search for cute and comfortable.  C Leopard: White, tag says 95% polyester 5% spandex. These were the softest of the 3 pairs but were definitely not that “buttery soft” smooth material like LuLaRoe and other brand leggings are. Got a Medium in these and the length is about 2 inches longer than the Small, and 1.5 inches wider in the waist. These have a sewn on flat cuff around the ankle. Pockets at hips. White pants are NOT see though! FIT: (Medium) baggy, bunched at my ankles, all around loose around my entire legs. Technically could stay on me just fine, but too big for my liking.  C Leopard Brown: 95% polyester 5% spandex, similar to the white pair but not quite as soft. I was surprised the material felt different from the white pair, but I’m wondering if that’s because of the coloring process to make these brown. These also have a sewn flat ankle cuff and pockets at hips. FIT: (SMALL) they felt great! Since I’m only 5’3” they bunched at my ankles but not as bad at the medium. Were the perfect tightness around my legs, plenty of stretch throughout.  I was searching for a review with these details when I was deciding on which ones to buy, so I really hope this helps you in your online shopping! :)",682

BookGirl,"Fabric unknown, color is off, odd smell & too big.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DHC4F3R13QNM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08B59JT6F,"2.0 "," the United States "," July 7, 2023",Size: MediumColor: C1 Leopard Black,Verified Purchase,"I’m not going to say not to get these joggers because they are comfy but I ordered a medium and they are quiet large. I ordered the black leopard print and they are also much darker than the images. I’m only 5’2” so I always expect pants to be longer on me. If it goes to the ankle on the 5’7”model, it’s probably going to touch the ground or scrunch up at the bottom which is what these did. Fine but the rest of the fit is also larger than a normal medium. The material is ok, it’s a bit thick for summer but it does have this weird glue like smell, maybe from the factory. No tags on it so can’t really tell what fabric it is as I find what they say on the description doesn’t always match the actual product. Overall these are ok for house lounging, wouldn’t really wear them out. I was expecting, from the pictures to have a cute pair of pants to wear out and about but sadly they fit and look more like pajama bottoms. I think I’m going to give up buying random pants on Amazon as I’ve never truly been satisfied with what I receive. Much better to go to a store, try it on, and spend a little more but buy fewer items that end up in the junk or “lounge” pile.",

I’m 5’3’’ and 250 pounds and carry extra weight in my belly. I ordered a 2X since that’s what I normally do when I order clothes from SHEIN and stuff like that.

It’s a nice color, but it isn’t khaki; it has a pink cast to it. The fabric is 100% polyester, and feels sort of like the material athletic jackets and joggers are made of. It feels very soft on the outside but rougher on the inside, against my skin. The elastic at the ankle doesn’t cinch much. The ankle is almost as wide as the rest of the pant leg, which is not what I want in a jogger. I bought these on sale for about $24, but that’s about the same price I paid for a great pair of joggers elsewhere. These are cheap, overpriced pants.",21

At 5""6 and XXL the length is not to baggy nor too short. The fits gives plenty of room for moment. The fabric is not see threw, however I found them to be a little heavy for 90 degree weather and maybe to light for the cold winter but they do have enough room for tights or thermals underneath. I don't like that the fabric is scratchy on the inside and the pockets are not deep enough to hold my cell phone infact I don't trust anything in my pockets they are that swallow. I may have to iron them but I hope not. I did order 12 pairs and return most of them because the colors was off: The red was more like burgundy The black was more like a deep grayish brown The khaki was not dark enough more like cream The greens look like army green and another lighter than evergreen The white was on point as well as the pink and royal blue. One brown was like a deep orange actually very pretty but not what I was expecting I feel that these joggers are definitely overpriced even at the sale price,poop o poobut they good on me!",

Just not something I could wear out of the house.",5
