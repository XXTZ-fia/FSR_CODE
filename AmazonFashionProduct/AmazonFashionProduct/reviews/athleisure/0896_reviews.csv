Melisa Sanhueza,The Perfect Lightweight Jacket for Everyday!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UOMB7KUBVQLJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08LGQ4721,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 31, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"This jacket has become my absolute go-to! It’s super lightweight, comfortable, and versatile enough to pair with anything. The material feels great, and I love the thumb holes—they add a stylish touch while keeping the sleeves in place during workouts. It’s breathable yet keeps me warm on cooler days, making it perfect for layering. Plus, the fit is flattering, and I get compliments whenever I wear it. Highly recommend if you're looking for a stylish, functional, and comfortable jacket!",3
Twinpossible,"Love this top! Perfect fit, perfect price 💲!

I went against any typical sizing I’d usually go with due to my bust size (34DD), any strayed away from the size chart provided, and I took a chance on an XS. Fits perfectly 👍! There’s a great amount of stretch & it’s not a really constricting fabric, so my girls aren’t getting squished & squashed, so if in any doubt.. size down, but definitely don’t go passed your regular shirt size! My gamble paid off PERFECTLY!  It’s a nice BBL dupe, since it’s fitted and styled in a certain way at the lower waist, that gives you a more curvy, snatched look. I’m happy since I can’t afford a true BBL until next winter 😢. My kids stole my hourglass bod, and I want it back, but I digress, lol. I got two of these here on sale, and I’m very happy to have gotten two tops for under $30. THAT is a deal. If it wasn’t almost springtime I’d buy more.  Overall, I’m happy & the thumb holes help hide my older looking hands that I hate. A worthy buy!  5 stars!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  ** I hope my review has been helpful to you 😊. **",27

It's sleek and modern, with a full zip and a high collar that provides extra warmth and protection from the elements. The thumb holes are a great addition, keeping the sleeves securely in place while allowing for maximum mobility during workouts or other activities.  The fabric is lightweight and breathable, making it perfect for a variety of activities, from running and hiking to yoga and weightlifting. It's also moisture-wicking, which is a must for any workout gear, ensuring that sweat doesn't build up and cause discomfort.  In terms of sizing, I found this jacket to be true to size. I usually wear a xL, and the xxL fit me perfectly. The length is just right, hitting at the hip, and the sleeves are the perfect length as well. I went up a size because I am tall and my arms are long  One thing to note is that this jacket is not very thick, so if you're looking for something to keep you warm in extremely cold temperatures, you may want to layer it with something else. However, for mild to moderate temperatures, it's a great option.  Overall, I highly recommend the jacket. It's a versatile and stylish piece of workout gear that is sure to become a staple in your athletic wardrobe.",46
