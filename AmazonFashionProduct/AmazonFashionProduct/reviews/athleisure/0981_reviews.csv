Too flimsy and lightweight for the front door….looks cute but wind blows it away.

The padding is a nice touch but not too much. I don't wear it as often now because I live in a place where exposing your middle is somewhat frowned upon (if you have high waist leggings it will cover you fully, but if you raise your arms above your head you'll probably show some skin). Will wear it more often again at home in the summer and when I move back to a less conservative area.",
Jules,Go-to sports top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DFF7OOM0KDS3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9SK5G5Q,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,These are my go-to tanks.

In white you can totally see the pads, though. Looks like Balogna Barb from Pitch Perfect lol so I just took those out because nipping looked better than that.

The bottom rides up on me so I find myself pulling it down a lot, but that could be because I have a smaller waist and big hips so it’s kind of “story of my life.”",
