This set was better quality than I expected. The shorts felt like they were going to be too small but as soon as I put them on they fit like a glove. They don’t ride up in the legs and don’t fall down in the band.  The straps on the top were a little wider than I’m used to, but I love the look and everything stayed in place during my HIIT workout.I’m not one to wear a matching set when working out, so I’m having fun mixing and matching this set with my other workout clothes, but could definitely see myself wearing this set together on vacation!  Overall very pleased with this purchase. The brown was an awesome choice- it has a little more of a maroon tint to it and it looks great!",6

Loved the color, loved the fit of the leggings. The legs fit me well. The only issue was the top. The straps were too long and can not be adjusted.

I’m usually a size small in most things, but I’ve found that when Amazon clothes shopping sizes vary greatly and often run smaller than anticipated.

No pattern changes, no stupid round darker colored “circle” shapes on the butt either! I’m 5 ft, 4 in, fluctuate from 125-134 lbs due to Endometriosis that when fired up -gives me a little more tummy than usual & makes me very self conscious on my petite frame. The high-waisted band naturally sat above my belly button & snatched me in lovely, BUT I adjusted it lower to suck me in where I wanted to be & it did, plus it stayed there AND didn’t change how the bottoms looked OR bunch them up as MANY others do! Didn’t lose elasticity after10 hours & would’ve lasted longer, so def squat proof & Bonus = My Husband LOVED them & didn’t let me alone the whole night ❤️❤️ The top is padded & has the same thick band as the waist. My 36C’s fit with room but not loose either. I will say that though band doesn’t ride up - I did have to pull it down to makeup for a SMIDGE of slack on the straps, but still isn’t what I’d consider worthy of sewing.

It is made of a relatively thick, ribbed material which is flattering on all bodies. I am approximately 160 lbs and usually wear a medium top and size 8-10 bottoms. I purchased this set in a size medium - which was right for the top. I do wish I could have purchased the bottoms separately as a large would fit me better. The waist band of the shorts rolls down ever so slightly and the bottom of the shorts ride up on my thighs some after movement. But, as a woman with thicker thighs, I find the riding up happens with virtually all shorts. I will say I still find this set to be comfortable, compressive/holds in the tummy, flattering, and is not see through. I intend to buy additional sets in more colors!",9

However the straps are kind of long and when you're working out it definitely will not stay up on your shoulders. The pants are a bit tight but they are thick enough to really hold you in. I recommend this set for people are into the athleisure look that are not really going to work out at all. The color is cute too.,

Katherine Marcan,Awkward fit for an athletic body type,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RLV5YZ9EBDG9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08ZYLY4C2,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 26, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"I was really excited to get this set, but found it pretty awkward fitting. The top runs a bit small and the pads sat oddly on my breasts (luckily they are removable). The shoulder straps are also too far apart. I have broad shoulders and the straps still lie too far out, making it feel like they are constantly slipping off my shoulders. The bottoms fit a bit better, but still awkward. I have strong, but lean legs and the pants are tight around my thighs, but too loose around my waist. I feel like I have to constantly pull them up as they slouch off my hips. Te fabric is nice and a good thickness. They are very soft and it’s a good lounge set, but not ideal for the gym.",6

However, after an hour of wearing this set, I noticed a few nuisances. First, the straps to the top were too baggy and kept sliding off my shoulders.

I don't know if I should return the set for it a large because I like the fit on the top but not the bottom.",
