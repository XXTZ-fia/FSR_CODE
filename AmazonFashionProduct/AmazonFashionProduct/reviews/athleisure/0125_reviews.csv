Lee Ann Countryman,Top is a little short in front,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QXVX4LLXVST3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8FSJ66F,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 13, 2024",,,Love the material.

Deb Mericle,I like the pants…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ATT82Y9GEFUV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8FSJ66F,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 29, 2024",,,"This is a sweatsuit made out of a knit kind of fabric.  It is stretchy, breathable and warm.  There are some things I like and some things…not so much.  I like the style of the pants.  They are a home run.  Stretchy, cut and designed well, slimming - super flattering.  However, the top is the not so much thing.  The top has these big slits up the sides.  But, they are so split that it actually shows my stomach when I move.  And it is very cropped, so it sort of tents out over my chest area…hmmm…not so flattering.  The fit is true to size in my case.  Even the length of the pants is awesome - I’m average height 5’5”.  The outfit is easy care, but seems to attract every white thread and tiny lint available.  It collected all sorts of “lint enhancement” after washing it once.  The price is affordable and it is going to be used as PJs for me.  I hope it works out even better for you.",3
Amazon Customer,Comfy and cropped,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WDSHQ8JXT1IF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8FSJ66F,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 1, 2024",,,"I'm 5'9"", so the cropped top isn't great with my post-menopausal midsection. The set is comfortable, though, so I can see wearing this when I'm home for the night and want to wear something that can double as pajamas.  One thing that's wrong with the product photos is visible in the images posted by other reviewers. The drawstring of the pants does not match the set's color; instead, it is a plain canvas color.",
@toosexyformyshelf,Decent,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VFY6MV1NSDBK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8FSJ66F,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 17, 2024",,,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this. It met my expectations and I would recommend it to others!,
CJ West,Comfy but Confusing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29G0NZ3PVD7BW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8FSJ66F,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 26, 2024",,,"Ok, so this set is wonderfully soft and comfy to wear. Love the roominess in the pants and the pockets. V-neck hoodie is perfect as an outer piece.  The confusing part is the crop-top front of the hoodie, since the back is a normal length. Yea, that's why this works as an outer piece and not just a top. If you want to hid the midriff, then you'll need an under-piece that covers.  So, TLDR; great for home and lounging but maybe needs an undershirt if going out.",
Syed,comfy lounge set,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33HA2CZL9FKV4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8FSJ66F,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 30, 2024",,,"This 2 piece lounge set is so comfortable. The material is stretchy, soft and well made. The long length pants with crop top hoodie looks stylish. I really like the roominess in pants with pockets. It's a perfect set for home and outside. But for those who don't wear crop top outside need to wear a shirt underneath. Overall, it's a perfect lounge wear set.",
Sara M.,So comfy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JAMI28L66FKK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8FSJ66F,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 13, 2024",Color: BlueSize: Large,,"This set is very comfortable.  The fabric is soft and not itchy, the bottoms have pockets and a drawstring.  The top has a hood.  Now to what I don't like.  The bottoms are pleated, which I find is weird.  The pleats go down about a quarter of the way down my thigh, so you can't hide them.  At least not with this shirt.  The top is cropped much higher than the pictures show.  Way above your belly button.  So, if you have a mom pouch, this isn't the set for you.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the set is comfortable.  Just be sure to wear a shirt or tank under the top.",2

Mauricio J. Solorzano,Makes you look fat,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R42P0HMCVSKK8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8FSJ66F,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 12, 2024",Color: BlueSize: Large,,"I recently tried out the NORACORA 2-piece lounge set, and while the fabric is undeniably soft and breathable, this style didn’t quite work for me. The high-quality, stretchy knitted material feels gentle on the skin and is perfect for lounging around or casual outings. The hoodie has a cozy feel, and the pants come with an adjustable drawstring waistband and practical side pockets, which are nice touches.  However, I found that the particular cut and fit of this set didn't do much for my figure. The wide-leg pants and loose sweatshirt created a bulkier look than I anticipated, making me feel larger than I am. It’s a comfortable set, no doubt, but if you’re looking for something that provides a more flattering silhouette, this might not be the best choice. It’s great for relaxed days at home or travel, but it didn’t quite hit the mark for a stylish look on me.",
Hermione G.,SO CLOSE yet so far away,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39F0M655RCYI6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8FSJ66F,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 11, 2024",,,"This set is really odd. It is within a short toss of EXCELLENT, but it's just... not. The top is very short in the front - and I'm a short person. That would be no problem in the grand scheme, but in context of all the other odd things, it's not helping. The pants have pleats VERY low down on the belly. Like bizarrely, incredibly unflatteringly low. I'm the first to say that we don't have to wear things that flatter us, but at the same time this is just an incredibly odd choice. I'm no fan of pleats but if we have to have them can they at least be where they belong on the garment? Also the drawstring is BRIGHT WHITE, not red as pictured, and looks like shoestrings. It's not the same material, but it's the same vibe. The fabric is reasonably soft and it would be very comfortable if better designed.",

I was a little hesitant about the top because it's a little short, but the pants are high enough that it works.  The pants are elastic waist with a drawstring and the waistline is comfortable; the pants legs are slightly flared at the bottom, but not too much...large pockets make these lounge pants ideal.  The hood on the shirt is a little big but it fits the design of the set.  Overall, it's my new favorite for relaxing after work on a chilly evening.",

But I also wanted it to do some more duty at my destination. This is the kind of outfit you can wear for lounging as well as touring. The pants have pleats in the front which make the legs extra roomy and add style. The top is shorter in the front than the back, keeping it roomy without looking like a tunic. The fabric is a soft and thin jersey rib-knit with plenty of stretch. There's room for layering under the top, making it multi-seasonal. I am 5'3"" and the pants are long on me.  Other than that, the medium fits my 35""-30""-39"" measurements pretty well. The combination of elastic and drawstring waist will be  forgiving if I put a couple extra pounds on, (or even manage to take a few off) Very versatile!",2

Which is fine, but you want it to fit a bit loose unless you have perfect curves. My wife says it shows every cellulite pucker, but she got it big enough so that she feels like it isn't putting that on display. She likes the high/low top, but says the front is more like a crop top - but she's very high waisted, so everything feels a little short on her. The pants are long enough on her 5'10"" frame which is really nice. The fabric is super soft and comfortable.",
