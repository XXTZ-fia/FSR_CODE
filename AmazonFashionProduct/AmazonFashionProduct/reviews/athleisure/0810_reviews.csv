The carbon grey color is very neutral and versatile if you decide to separate the two pieces and match them with other items from your closet.  The V neck top is very comfortable as opposed to a crewneck that I feel pulls back too much on your neck, and is bulky and uncomfortable.  The lining of both the pants and the top is a silky extra layer of a smooth netted material.  I feel this creates a coolness, and moisture wicking action to the fabric to help you from overheating, and aids the breathability.  The cargo pants have side pockets for your hands and then 2 more secure pockets, (for a total of 4), a bit lower on the leg that are perfect for my small wallet car keys, and phone when I go out to run errands, and don't want to take my whole purse.  The arm cuffs are stretchy and not tight.  Also the elastic both on the waist of the pants, and the bottom leg cuffs is non-binding and very stretchy to provide a nice ""cling"" to your body without cutting into you, if that makes sense?  -I've had lounge pants that have a thin and very tight elastic in the top that is very harsh and cuts into your stomach- not very relaxing!  These pants are not like that at all! The elastic is exactly the thickness and stretch that I like!The company really designed both pieces of this set really well, and paid attention to maintaining a high comfort level as well as being a very flattering style.  I got the size medium so I could have a lot of extra room to be extremely comfortable.  My normal size is small and that would have fit me completely true to size.  So if you want a good fit, stick with your normal size, but if you want room like I did, go up one size- not as cute on, but the trade off is a lounge set that is super comfortable!  For reference my measurements are; 5'6"", 36"" hips, 28.5"" waist, 34B with an athletic build (no curves), and I weigh 126 pounds.  Highly recommended.",5
Anastasia Ivanova,High quality and very nice,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DIR6MSZTXRT8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8J85S8K,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 6, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Beige,,"I absolutely loved this set! It looks great (better than on the pictures, plus it needs to be ironed). The material is very soft and smooth and very gentle on your skin. At the same time it’s pretty warm and made really great! Great quality. And very comfortable. The size is right (it’s S, I’m 5’5” tall). I like this apricot color. It can be worn together or will look great with different clothes too. I definitely remember, goo price for a great quality set! It was delivered very fast, no any damages, I’m absolutely happy with this order!",
