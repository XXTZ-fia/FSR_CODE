I wear a large and my brother also wears a large but its tight for him. When we tried them on he couldnt even get his on and mine was so tight it was as if I was plastic wrapped and heat shrinked around my body. So I thought OK i'll reorder one size large. I give my cousin the large since he wears a medium and as soon as he put it on it fit perfectly. He was happy. Then he washed it that night, threw it in the dryer, and now he cant fit it.  Order 2 sizes too large, and if its a tad big just keep shrinking it on high in the dryer 30min sessions until its the right size and then air dry from then on or low heat dry only.",

It's quite a bit thinner than the other one too. My son tried it on and thinks it will be fine, but he hasn't had the chance to find out if it will keep him warmer or not.
