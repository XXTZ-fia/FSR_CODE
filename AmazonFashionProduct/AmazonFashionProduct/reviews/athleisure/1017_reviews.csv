I frequently travel for work and wanted a comfortable but polished look. This set delivered! I waited to review it because I wanted to get a wear and wash in. One drawback is that it is line dry. I washed it by itself on the delicate cycle, thre it in the dryer for 10 minutes and then hung it to dry. It kept it's shape and didn't shrink and washed well (no loose seams, fuzzballs, or material creasing/wrinkling). I stopped by the SPANX store on my way to my gate and compared the zippers, fabric, and drawstring and it is 90% identical. Also, the thicker fabric helps to camouflage any bumps, dimples, or imperfections :-) I was surprised at the high quality of this set and it definitely filled the need for a comfy casual trip outfit.",

It is quality clothing at a reasonable price. This two-piece set is no exception. I'm 5-4, 140 lbs, with a curvy figure. The size small fit perfectly, although the waistband was a bit tight when pulling it on over my hips. However, once it was on, the waistband was comfortable. The sleeve length is a bit long, with the sleeve hitting above just where my thumb meets my palm, but I like that, especially when it's cold out. The inseam length is perfect -- no need to hem the pants. The pants also feature side pockets, and the top has a half zip that you can unzip all the way and show off a tanktop underneath, or zip all the way up for added warmth. I got it in Navy, but have now ordered a Medium in Black, just to compare. Perfect for running errands or a remote work day.",34
