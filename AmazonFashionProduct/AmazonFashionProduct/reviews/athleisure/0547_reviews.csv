Alex G.,Very comfortable but waist is inconsistent,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMD90ZT4LYNXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCJ4BJ2G,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 26, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Brown,Verified Purchase,I have a few pairs of these pants and I really love to wear them to workout and to the airport. They do not slide down but the sizing is very off. The legs fit but the elastic in the same size with different pairs does vary. Some are made larger and smaller than others (I guess this is amazon fashion?)  They wash well and are not too oversized for when I take barre/pilates classes. They are especially great for the certain days out of the month that I do not want to wear very tight pants to workout.,5
K.

I'm 5'6 and they hit just above the ankle, which I like. They're relaxed in the legs but not the the point of being Hammer pants. They actually have more of a tailored look. The waistband is high and not restrictive. It rolled down a bit when I was sitting, but that was easy to fix-- I'd rather have that than a too-tight waistband that digs in or gives me extra rolls around my midsection. The shiny animal print is SO CUUUUUUTE! Can definitely dress them up or down. This morning I wore them out with a collared shirt and sweater, and this afternoon I'm wearing them around the house with a black half-zip sweatshirt. Both look great. It's below freezing in Chicago today, and with a long coat they're fine for going from your car to a building and back. Would wear for running a few errands, but not for extended time outside (like walking from the train to work). I'm hoping these will be a new staple for Fall/Winter/Spring, and maybe on less hot summer days.",

The high waist offers great support and stays put during workouts, while the loose leggings give a relaxed fit without being too baggy.  These joggers are versatile and stylish, making them a great addition to any wardrobe. Whether I'm hitting the gym, running errands, or just chilling at home, these pants are my new favorite. Highly recommend the G Gradual Women's Joggers for their comfort, practicality, and style!  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because after wearing them.for a while they seem to stretch out a little around the waist. Maybe ordering a size down would do the trick.",17

I had to send these back because I measure 44” in my hips and according to the size guide I even needed to order bigger. Well I got an XL and while super soft and super comfy they were a bit bigger than I’m comfortable with in the waist and my waist measures around 37”, and slightly baggy in thigh bum area. YOU GUYS, the waist sizing doesn’t even go up that high on the inches chart. Seriously what’s the point if they aren’t even going to remotely be somewhat accurate. I have worked from home for the last 4.5 years and have gained a lot of weight, it’s bad enough not having cloths that fit but attempting to order based on the size charts acting like you’re much bigger than you are is down right insulting. My other main measurements just for anyone a similar size that I pray will read this, I stand right about 5’7” and I’m 165lbs. Please do not size up unless you really want super loose fitting. I do think I could have made the XL work provided I wasn’t intending on putting my phone in the pocket when taking my dogs out, however, since that is my intention and there’s no draw string I don’t think it would have been safe not for me, not for my neighbors! Lol to add insult to injury I have to wait to reorder a size large until I get back from an overnight trip with my mom, unfortunately my refund was processed too late in the day for me to get next day processing, I’m bummed! I was really hoping to take a new pair of cozy pants to the hot springs. Alas I shall have to wait, but please ladies I beg you don’t “follow” the chart like I did. I’ll try to add an update once I get the appropriate size.",8

I am 5'5"", 125lbs; I am more of a ""ruler"" than an ""hourglass"". I wanted to replace some lyocell joggers that have faded and lose their shape after a few minutes of wear. I ordered Small from G Gradual and 4 other top jogger brands sold on Amazon. What sold me on this brand was the comfortable fit... after trying on all 5 brands several times, I started to appreciate that these G Gradual joggers *don't* have a thin elastic band inside at the top of the waist. The waistband is wide and smooth and stretchy like a yoga pant and it makes them so much more comfortable than those with elastic inside- I am often bloated thanks to colitis. The fit on the backside is more flattering with these. Note- they don't have a gathered, drawstring waist either, so it seems like a smoother, leaner fit- and No strings to loop in the front. I'm sending the other 4 back and ordering more G Gradual joggers in other colors. I hope they wash/wear well (fingers crossed)",8

I have trouble buying bottoms because my hips are bigger than the rest of me which can make pants really tight or draw attention to my hips.  I noticed right away that the pockets are placed perfectly and do not draw attention to my hips nor do they make my hips look bigger so right away I love that!  The material is nice but it does make noise when you walk. I like that the waistband is flat and doesn't have a string or anything but the waist band rolls down a bit which doesn't really show but I did not notice. Another thing because of the material, I noticed these joggers move a bit. If they were just a tad heavier in weight, they might not move but I am having to tug at them to put them back in place.  Good to have one pair but not ones I would buy multiples of. I am 5'2"", 145 lbs, pearshape figure and the medium fits me pretty well.",

Only thing I’ll say, is to order whatever size leggings you would typically order for these pants. I typically order a medium, but like my joggers to fit a bit bigger, so I ordered up to a large. I do like the way they fit, however, I will be ordering mediums next. I happen to love the loose waistband, but a medium will fit me a little bit better.  Super soft, breathable, not see through, still gives good shape, and great quality for a really great price point!!",18

A small is definitely a small. I am 5’ 0” tall 144lbs. The pants fit perfect around the waist.  Wish it had more leg room and that they were a little longer. I bought this pair because they resembled an Ideology brand that I purchased through Macy’s, they were close but the material was not as silky and smooth as I would have liked. The pants were delivered in a zippered plastic bag. No other wrapping.",3

Murderess Marbie,TTS. Bought a large thinking because of my size 8 big butt I'd need bigger.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QI3OKZDLXSY8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCJ4BJ2G,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 15, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"First these aren't tights or joggers. It's in between. So I made the mistake of getting a size large instead of medium thinking I'd get a comfy style -like some comments suggested. I'm age 40. size 8. 29 waist. 5'6"" at 178 lbs, 41"" hips, but I carry muscle and a ton of extra butt and wide latina hips. So I can have major sizing issues. These fit perfectly on my mom who is size 10. 5'4"" 162lbs. 31 in jeans. Menopausal belly although she is a fit body type everywhere else. So I think go with your pants size rather than the baggy look. TTS if you're an hourglass figure. It does show cellulite but we both don't care about that. Because it's not much at all. She loved them. Soft smooth fabric, excellent quality, holds in the belly a bit and great stretch. Mom wants more colors now. I will see how the medium is on me and review those later. Loved how high the large went up, super high on the waist, so I hope it's the same, but, because I am an hourglass figure the waist width was a bit looser so it caused extra fabric to slide and bunch at the crotch & knees. Otherwise awesome. The color is boss. I LOVE muted lavenders and this is on the lighter side but perfect tone. Will definitely get a few of these for hiking in summer and for around the house. Also great stitching on seams. Strong hold and not tight or bulky at all. Only gripe is that it could be a bit longer on the ankles. And the camel toe seems to not be an issue unless you wear these really tight. But perfect nonetheless. If you're taller than me then these might get short on you but that's not a bad thing really.",38
