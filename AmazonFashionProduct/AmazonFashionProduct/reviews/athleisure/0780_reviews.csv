Happycamper88,"Amazing, So Warm and Soft",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MEBJNI0ZG9EM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CZL9WP59,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Color: White HeatherSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"My measurements are 42.5"" bust, 35.9"" waist and 47.8"" hips, and I wear 34"" inseam jeans (the long sizes for most brands). I purchased the XL and this set fit PERFECTLY. My arms are usually too long for most long-sleeved shirts, but these sleeves are long enough that I can comfortably slip my thumbs in the thumb holes and it doesn't feel like I'm pulling them. The top is relaxed fit (not tight at all, fits like a sweatshirt should) and cropped and stops right at the waist of the pants, so no midriff shows unless I reach up or over my head, and even then, it doesn't come up high enough to see my bra. The neck isn't tight. The pants come up just over my belly button at my natural waist and are super flattering. The waist band is wide and not tight, so there's no muffin top. It's really slimming, actually. The legs come all the way down to the bottom of my ankle bone, where the pants cinch, which is AMAZING because I have long legs and was concerned about them not being long enough. I have very large hips (see above), butt, legs (28.2"" thigh circumference) and ankles (10.1"" ankle circumference) and these are not tight. They fit perfectly. So perfectly that I am a little afraid to dry them. I will probably wash on cold and dry on gentle/not hot to prevent shrinking. I plan to wear these as warm-up sweats over my leggings to run outdoors in the winter before my indoor boxing sessions.",
Ray,THE MOST COZY SWEATSUIT EVER!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VVQG0K2LGUV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CZL9WP59,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Color: CoffeeSize: Large,Verified Purchase,I was so surprised by this sweatsuit outfit because my husband actually picked it out for it. It is so cute! It is so soft and fuzzy. The little detailing of the slightly cropped but still long enough hoodie hits at the perfect line. The pants are scrunched at the bottom and they have a little baggy fit so you can lay back and be chill the whole day. No one likes super tight sweats anyways. This suit is a must buy and you will NOT be disappointed!,

The set is good quality and comfortable. However, it runs pretty small. I’m a true medium (5’8, 135 lbs) and this fit like a tight small in the waistband. It stretches a lot, but then squeezes you back in. The top is cropped so keep that in mind. I got the bean green color and it was a little lighter / more vibrant than I was expecting. It was pretty, but I ended up not liking the color (because of personal taste, not the seller). I’m 5’8 and the pants hit perfectly at my ankles. They’re also high wasted and your mid section should be covered with the cropped hoodie if you wear them where they are intended. Ultimately, I am returning, but it’s a good choice if you get the sizing right.",14
