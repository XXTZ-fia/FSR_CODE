Ali Rae Tokarski,Adorable!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KJIC4DYFL9N1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB5KDBL6,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 31, 2024",Special Size: Crop LengthSize: X-Large-XX-LargeColor: Neon Pink+green+orange,Verified Purchase,I want these in every color! These are great for basically everything from working out to sleeping to just lounging around. They are also cute if you want to wear with a pair of jeans. The fabric is soft and stretchy so it fits my curves perfectly! Not see through so that’s a plus.  Buying more asap!!,
Natalie M Tejeda,Amazing Staple! Buying more!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2430KITCFLSFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB5KDBL6,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Special Size: Waist LengthSize: Medium-LargeColor: White+gray+black,Verified Purchase,"(My info: 5’8, 130, 36DDD, 37-29-37) I ordered a Medium and they fit perfect! I needed a longer tank to be able to tuck into my jeans at work because cropped tanks are not allowed. And these fit the bill even though I wear high-rise jeans. They stay tucked in, don’t pop out, and are super comfortable and keep their shape all day long. I don’t find myself having to readjust the tank. I.e. pull it down tuck it back in adjust the girls, etc. it stays in place for a full 8 to 12 hours that I’m mixing drinks and running around behind the bar.  I’m a huge fan of ribbed tanks because they tend to hold up and keep their shape better, longevity wise, than traditional cotton for long-term abuse and workwear. I wear the black one multiple times a week for work and it always looks great. It shows just enough of the girls to encourage tips, but not be obscene.  Note I also ordered these tanks in the traditional square next style in medium, but they were too big so I will be ordering those ones in a small so just be aware that your sizing may vary style by style.",2

I’m about a B cup right now and you can see my mom nips from afar!!! But hey my husband is OK with it 😂.  The shirt is very supportive, like a bra but not as tight. I’ve always struggled with finding comfy bras cause I’m more of a 38B or 38 A, which is hard to find. But these are supportive enough and comfy. I’d have to wear a shirt or sweater over in public though cause my mama nips are showing and ones going north while the other is headed east 😂🤣!!!  10/10!!!!",

They are pretty enough to be worn alone as a workout crop top.  I tried both the waist length and the crop length and liked the crop better on me and that length worked better under my tees as they are a bit cooler and I live in a very hot and humid climate.  Amazon made it easy to return and reorder.  In any case, these are very comfortable and do not add too much compression.  Since they have the wide straps, I can wear a racer back bra underneath them and it looks great.  The quality is great.  I would not hesitate to order more.  In fact, I have!  A lot of people evidently use these as a dupe for a more expensive, mainstream brand.  Having tops from both companies, I actually prefer these as they have less compression and are softer plus they are less expensive!  These come in lots of colors.  I am very pleased with this purchase.",2

I bartend and we are allowed to bring in our own shirts to get embroidered with our restaurants logo. When I found these I fell in love and kept ordering them…the amount of trips my boss had to make to the embroidery store is ridiculous hahaha  They are true to size and they fit perfectly! I didn’t want to throw them in the dryer because I was afraid of the little balls forming on the tank tops..but I always forget and just throw them in there anyways. I’ve had these for almost a year now and they are still holding up even after being put in the dryer with no balls of material forming!

I had to wear pasties to make sure the girls weren't showing. But loved the fit and the mid-body waist line. It did roll up a few times and I had to pull it down but not too bad. I'm just really self conscious about my midriff. Having 3 kids it's not my 20 year old body anymore. But with a high waist Jean or shorts I love these tops. I haven't washed them yet so I'm not sure if they will shrink. Also I am smaller chested (34B) and these would not support bigger chests. It's not like a sports bra. But I love that it was tight enough where I didn't have to wear a bra. Life saver when it comes to new mexico heat.,

Super soft, comfy, stretchy and flattering! I weigh 180 (5’7”) and the M/L is great. I personally hand wash these because I noticed they do not like being washed in the wash machine!
