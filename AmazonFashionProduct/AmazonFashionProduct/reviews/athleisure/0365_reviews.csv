It's hard to know for sure since I had sunscreen on, but I can say that putting this on after an hour or so of just using sunscreen, I did not get any sunburns. It's comfortable but having long-sleeved anything on in tropic sunshine & humidity is going to get a bit warm including this shirt. Better than a burn, though. The style is casual. It went well with ""athleisure"" wear like sports capris, tee shirts, and tank tops. It didn't go well with a sleeveless casual sundress.

So finally decided I needed to get one before heading to Jekyll Island, GA, while still at the edge of ""these mosquitoes are going to carry us OFF the island"" season. It was PERFECT and has been perfect for every trip since! I'm usually an XL and I prefer things to not be fitted or clingy in any way so I was really worried this shirt would be one of those that are made for only those with tiny shoulders and waists like so many other shirts marketed for women. I'm not a small person and I usually prefer men's shirts because they just have more room but this shirt was exactly right for my frame. It was big enough to layer as well as comfortably button and wear by itself without being tight in the chest area (or belly!!). I love the fabric which was great for cooler nights and warmer days - very breathable. Lots of pockets but not so much that you look like you have a cargo vest on so again, points for style AND function! Going to get at least one more for longer trips because this can get funky after a couple of nights by the campfire!! (photo doesn't show the real length but I'm 5'6"" and it hits me comfortably at mid hip and just does cover the backside without looking like an oversized shirt.)",14

The chaotic creases are epic, and remain, no matter what anti-wrinkle product I try, and despite steaming and whichever of several washing/drying methods I've tried. The major creases that are way beyond wrinkles, persist. Some others I have ordered over the past few years came and remained less or mostly unwrinkled. One shirt smoothed out after hoy-cycle drying, but that only worked that once. So this is now a 1-star review, just to provide a warning to others - I wear these anyway, creased and wrinkly because of the pockets and SPF 50 material - I just pretend it's a new style (lol). But buyers need to know about this permanent creases likelihood, I've come to feel. It could be a deal-breaker or a challenge.",6

The zippered side pockets are big enough to fit my iPhone although the phone’s weight pulls the shirt down so much that the hem then looks crooked.

It was too big for me.  I think just an XL or perhaps even a L would have fit better.  So I gave this to my husband and it looks nice on him.  There s a zipper pocket on the front by the chest and 2 additional zippered pockets on the front near the waist.  On the back, the “cape” part has open mesh ventilation underneath.  The fabric is soft, went through the washer/dryer without shrinkage or fading and all the zippers worked easily.  The sleeves were too long on both of us.  (My husband usually wears a 34/35 arm length dress shirt and these sleeves were too long.) I would also like if inside the zipper pockets were sewn down more The top and bottom are sewn down, but the sides are not.",2

What I especially love are the zippered pockets to keep contents safe from falling out or being knocked by savvy pickpockets. I am planning to take this with me on a tropical vacation. I love that the long sleeves will provide ample protection from the sun, but can also be rolled up and secured by straps/buttons. I hope the vented meshed backing will keep me cool in the heat. I went with white so it can match everything but I'm a bit worried the smog/pollution will get this dirty in no time. I'm hoping to be able to get multiple uses out of it before washing. At any rate, for $25 at the time of this review, you get a lot of bang for your buck with this shirt. It can compete with more expensive name brand tops for so much less.",2

I'll probably wear it over a t-shirt and then just leave it open/unbuttoned.  Care instructions - the tag on this shirt says - No Bleach, Low Iron, Hang Dry and (machine) wash below 40 degrees C.

I especially like the Front Pocket with the Zipper, where you can store away ID, Money, etc. I also like the Mesh-lined Vented Back of the Shirt, which allows Airflow. Overall, I really like this Shirt because it’s very comfortable to wear and because it’s very practical. The only Thing I noticed is that it was a Bit larger than my usual Size Small. The included Photos show how much longer the Sleeves are. But that’s not a Problem; I’ll just fold them up. Other than that, I am happy with this Order.",
