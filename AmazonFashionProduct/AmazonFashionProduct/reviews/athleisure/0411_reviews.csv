When I first got it, it was slightly too big. It gapped at my armpits, and hung down too low. I was going to return it, but I really liked the color, and decided to keep it. I gave it four stars because it does shrink. It’s a totally different shirt once you wash it. It will shrink up quite a bit, and the feel of it changes. It feels like a cheap polyester shirt out of the bag, but after you wash and dry it, it feels and lays soft like cotton. It is a thin, slightly clingy material. I cannot see my sports bra color through the material, but I can definitely see the shape. It will show some of your curves if you have any you like to normally hide. I like how it gathers over the butt from the cross over in the back.",3

The fabric itself is soft but it starts weighing down. I was just drenched and for the 1st time, needed to change my shirt before leaving the courts.

I ordered it because the reviews said it was long and at 6’, there aren’t a lot of affordable options. The care tag suggested hand wash but I did run it through the wash with similar items and hung dry and it seems to be in good condition. The top is very thin which is good and cool but it’s definitely not a forgiving material if you have anything squeezing out the top of your shorts/pants. It’s also very wrinkly.
