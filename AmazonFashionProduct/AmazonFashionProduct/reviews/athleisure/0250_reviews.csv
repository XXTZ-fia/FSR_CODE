Loshad,Super Soft and Comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RURR7RBEZGFFX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07JFYNYBG,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 8, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"LOVE these tops. Not only are they very soft and comfortable, the cut out in the back makes it super stylish. Originally I ordered two. Not sure how I would like them. I have now ordered this top in five different colors. Sizing is very accurate. They wash very well, no bleeding. I dry them slightly and take them out while they’re damp and lay them flat to dry. Wrinkling does not seem to be a problem either. Very pleased with this top. I highly recommend, especially for the price. I have some from Athleta that were much more expensive but these are my favorites.",6
Rachel,"Nice quality, just wasn't into the style",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C8VBSSGNG5FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07JFYNYBG,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Fuchsia,Verified Purchase,"Granted, this is a nice shirt. The fabric is soft and comfortable, and the cut is flattering. However, I can personally vouch that it's not a great yoga shirt, as opposed to what the product description states--it was constantly falling down into my face whenever I did a downward dog in yoga class. And for someone who is a little self-conscious about their belly, this was less than ideal.  The other little gripe I had is that the sleeves are snug and trap in heat, while the back is very open and breezy. So it's hard to find that perfect temperature range where this shirt is comfortable to wear.  The shirt did fit me well, but I ended up giving it away, because of the reasons I've mentioned, after owning it for a few months. (For reference, I bought a size large, I'm 5'8'', my weight is 170 lbs., and my bust/waist/hip measurements are 38"", 33"", and 43"", respectively.)",

This fabric loosely clings which is important if you have athletic shoulders or a fuller bust but generally have a lean body.  Without the drape, some tops can be so boxy and unflattering.  I also love the softness of this material. It washes beautifully as well. I liked it so well I bought a few.The material also moves nicely with you through your Yoga practice...the only really silly drawback for me is when in ""down-dog"", it falls so fully to the front that with my head between my arms I cannot see my toes...which is not that big of a deal. 😆🙏🏻One more thing. The open back is not too open. It has just enough of an opening to have your cute athletic bra peek through the most flattering part of your back between your shoulder blades.",14
