JMo.,Stylish and Versatile Coordinate Outfit Perfect for Any Occasion,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QSGJBXSD98VO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNCQ1XR2,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 20, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"I recently bought this outfit, which includes a tank top and pants, and I'm thoroughly impressed. This coordinate outfit features a sleek, modern and sophisticated look. I purchased black.  Design and Style: The outfit has a trendy design. It is a relaxed fit with a high neckline while the pants are wider legged with a slightly baggy appearance. Both pieces complement each other beautifully and can also be styled separately.  Material and Comfort: The fabric is both stylish and breathable. The fabric drapes well and doesn’t cling, making it comfortable to wear throughout the day. I appreciate the soft feel and the fact that it doesn't wrinkle easily.  Versatility and Functionality: This coordinate set is incredibly versatile. I’ve worn it to work and on the weekend. This pairs well with a jean coat, long sweater and either sneakers or casual dress shoes.  Durability and Performance: After several wears and washes, the outfit still looks great. The color hasn’t faded, and the fabric hasn’t lost its shape or pilled.  Price and Value: I purchased it with a coupon code, but even without the coupon code it’s a good value considering the quality and versatility.  Conclusion: This is a great addition to my wardrobe. It offers a stylish, comfortable, and versatile option that can seamlessly transition for different occasions. I highly recommend.",15

The top fit just right, and the bottom a good fit too, though they sit slightly above the ankle.

Kathleen,Perfect 2 piece outfit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LZF4I77WGVDJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNCQ1XR2,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 15, 2024",Color: BlackSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"I was hesitant to buy this outfit due to the price being so good...but an influencer I follow who chooses only high quality stuff insisted it was great.  Well it is!!!  So comfortable - great length for my 5'3"" height.  Only issues, because I am 170-175lbs and 36DD/38DD I  needed the XXL.. The armholes will need to be slightly altered as well as the neck if that can be done - it fits too loose.  But for the price and comfort any minor alterations will be worth it!  Will report back if it doesn't hold up well after washing.",28
