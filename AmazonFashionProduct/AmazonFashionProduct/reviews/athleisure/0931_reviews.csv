Nicole V,Better Than My Lululemon Top!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCMWN3IZIBG1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B088M5YWPZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Color: Off-whiteSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"I own a similar style crop tank from Lululemon, and honestly, I like this one even better! The material is super soft, breathable, and has just the right amount of stretch. I’m usually a small, and the sizing was spot on—fits perfectly without feeling too tight or restrictive.  Compared to my Lululemon top, this one is slightly less compressive, which makes it more comfortable for all-day wear. While Lululemon offers more support for intense workouts, it also squeezes my lats a bit too much, causing some unflattering bulging. This top, however, provides great coverage and support without that issue. The U-back design is both stylish and functional, keeping everything in place while still looking flattering.  Overall, this is an amazing dupe at a fraction of the price! Perfect for workouts, lounging, or even dressing up with jeans. I love it so much that I’m already planning to buy more colors! Highly recommend!",8
Sarah S,I will live in these all summer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JLZCY45JX6JB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B088M5YWPZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 28, 2023",Color: Jasmine GreenSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"Detailed review ahead (girl, be ready for a novel)….I have to say first that I am a die hard lululemon fan, but I work as a choreographer every summer for a well respected theatre camp. Last year, all my lululemon running shorts and most of my tanks were on their last leg. I had heard about these online and wanted to give them a try as an alternative for summer camp, as I could spend less and buy more colors to mix and match. WOW! For the money you can’t go wrong.  I purchased the white, black, denim blue, and jade green tanks and the matching mesh lined high waist running shorts. I am 5’7 and your typical smedium 32dd. I ordered medium across the board. I rapidly lose weight over the summer due to the heat and the exercise. I feel these will fit me if I fluctuate as low as about 15 pounds lighter.  Tanks- These are fantastic. They are not for super high impact, but for lower/ medium impact dance they are great. I can also see myself wearing these all summer as loungewear or with shorts. If I sized down it would’ve given me more cleavage than I wanted. I may try taking in the liner a bit for more security near the end of summer when I’ve dropped weight. Great lululemon dupe. Comfortable and flattering. The ONLY con I have is that the size varied slightly by color. The black and white fit more snug (which I preferred). The denim blue and Jade green fit a little looser as you can see in the side profile picture of the denim blue set.  Shorts- these are great dupes as well! The back pocket completely fits my iPhone XR. The side pocket is super secure and deep. The shorts are slightly longer in the back. The high waist is pretty small and includes about an inch of tighter elastic. I personally like this for camp so my walkie doesn’t pull them down, but if you have more of a square figure it may pay to size up. The tank meets right where these shorts start. My only complaint on these is sometimes the way they lay can look a bit funky in the crotch area, but nothing too major. The colors all looked great. I wore the white with red underwear and it didn’t show through where the mesh liner was.  As a set- Black is perfect and what you’d expect. The white is a CRISP white. Like, it made me pull out my teeth whitener white. It’s beautiful, but literally my Snow White OPI nail polish even looked a tad dingy in comparison. The Jade green shorts were a slightly different shade than the tank. It was not enough for my husband to notice without telling him. For some reason it looks a lot different in the photo but they’re more similar in person. The blue is a pretty darn close match. If anything, the band is slightly different due to the different material. It’s not a dealbreaker for me, as I plan to mix and match a lot  Final thoughts- I love them. I sent both my sisters the links to them, I will live in them all summer, and I will be buying more sets in a variety of colors. Lululemon who?",1 080

Cheyanna,These are some of my favorite workout tank tops from Amazon!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2P8J90JU0J104/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B088M5YWPZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Color: WhiteSize: Small,Verified Purchase,I have a few of these tank tops in different colors and I enjoy them very much.

Chelle,Super comfy & cuter than heck!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWM0YW1RFH6A3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B088M5YWPZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 24, 2024",Color: Soft PinkSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"LOVE these tanks! I got one in 3 different colors. That was the first thing I noticed when they arrived - the colors ARE beautiful. Next, weight/feel of the fabric and construction. The fabric is moisture wicking so some weight is necessary to support that feature. There's a built-in bra for support, and removable pads. The pads seem kinda weirdly shaped - almost flat. I ordered the medium size despite the size guide recommendation because I got reprimanded(??!) by the AI that quite literally INSISTED I order the medium! It wouldn't even LET me add the size large to my cart 😅 resorting to what appeared to be a pop-up blockade!! I've said for some time that if there are any internet entities that know me well, Amazon is most assuredly near or at the top of that list.  Anyhow, I'm 5'1"", 124lbs, a 36D, and I've been a gym rat since I was old enough to get into one - to give you an idea on physique. The medium really IS the best size choice for me, so thank you, Amazon AI! Back to the pads... Straight line on the bottom, dome shaped?? and flat-front. They made the armholes pucker because the fabric didn't want to accommodate my chest in this top with those pads. I took them out and replaced them with some I had from other sport bras that were much rounder in overall shape. Being able to swap the padding made a huge difference. I gotta say the ones that came with were more befitting a barely-A cup size. I couldn't take a star away for those crazy pads just because MY cup size isn't a standard medium. However, it seemed worth discussing.  Construction of these tanks are solid. I imagine these lasting a long time. They held up perfectly after washing. I washed them in cold water on the delicate cycle with low spin speed. I hung them to dry and ran them through my dryer for 5 minutes on air only, just to get the air-dry stiffness out of them.  Stitching is flawless - not a single loose thread anywhere - even after washing. And ZERO color fade, but I confess I wash nearly everything in Woolite as my base detergent.  If you're looking for a quality sports bra that easily doubles as a somewhat upscale tank, these are it! I do have to add that someone who is tall may find these short. I suspect the models they use are short-waisted. They are a perfect length on me at 5'1"".  (This review is copy/pasted for the other two colors I ordered.)",62

They had a great sale, so I decided I would just go for it, and try the fit for myself. My only regret is that I didn’t get this sooner because it ended up being absolutely perfect!!! I am very short, but on the more muscular side, and I have a pretty small chest. Despite my small cup size, I still wanted something with decent support without a push-up effect. I like that it fits in a way to enhance my figure without emphasizing it. Because of my shorter torso, finding a work out tank can be difficult because I want it to sit right at my waistband. Other brands are very generous with their cropping, but this brand really nails the long crop!!! This would definitely sit above someone else’s belly button, but on me, it is only a touch above. Because of this, it makes a great tank top for not just taller people with a belly button ring, but shorter people as well who have one too!! Also there is not a whole lot of side tissue or underarm fat being pronounced, which is rare with other snug fitting sport bras. I don’t have a lot to work with in the cup, but I usually have a bit of spillage that I don’t have here. The picture shows it exactly as I put it on, with minimal adjustments just for symmetry. For someone who is looking for more cleavage, you can definitely fluff it up by hoisting the side tissue towards the middle of the tank. I vary between a 32C, 34C, and a 34B bra and am 10 years post breastfeeding. I would feel enough support and security for a light jog, or otherwise pretty moderate activity working out. Someone else with a similar proportioned body, or slightly bigger cup size would probably feel the same way too, but anything bigger might want to save these only for a lower activity level. All in all a great top, and will definitely be coming back periodically for more colors!!!",45

I originally purchased two in large since I hate workout tops cutting into my back, but I later purchased 3 in medium for a tighter fit for high-impact classes. The top is flattering and the pads are of good quality. I appreciate the white is not see-through but the newer one in rose seems to be of thinner material. The material is more like swimwear or shiny workout wear which does not really match the flat fabric of Vuori or some Lululemon align but who is really looking that close? There is some variance in the sheen and weight of the fabric by colors. Black was very shiny.  In large the straps seem a bit longer with straps looser on the shoulders so I pull them up and the length falls lower below the waist. Medium the top in the lighter colors shows everything and they are shorter just above waist level so I am pulling down to cover my stomach sometimes. I just purchased 2 more in large to have some looser options this summer. I would not recommend this top for running or HIIT as they are best for low impact or smaller chest sizes.  They wash and dry very well in the dryer. I put them in garment bags during the wash to keep the tops and pads together. The pads are pretty indestructible but a few separated the foam and liners after a while. Photo is a large. The medium runs like a size 6-8 of other workout brands if that helps.",4

The medium sizing I slightly spilled out of the top and bottom of the cami and the top just rode up on my waist while moving around. I think you could get away with medium if you are okay with a slightly tighter top. But you will get spillage. I was worried about the straps coming of my shoulder but the medium was fine, didn't need any adjusting. Comes with cups you can remove and a built in cami.  Comparison to other products:  Lululemon align tanks is made of 89% nylon 11% elastane for a whopping $68.  This Amazon top is $18-22 and is 80% polyamide and 20% spandex. Polyamide and nylon are almost the same. Nylon is a type of polyamide.  Target makes a dupe and it's $22 and it's 69% recycled polyester and 31% spandex.

I was worried about sizing since I’ve kind of been all over the place. I’ve been a small for a long time but now I’m more of a medium. First, to help others on sizing- I am 5’2” and probably around 140ish lbs, I carry most of my weight in my hips and thighs, but also a little in my stomach lately. My chest measurement is about 36b and waist is around 29” right now give or take an inch. The medium in the black was PERFECT for me. It fit my waist without being to tight or too loose (probably closer to being almost loose, but the way it draped I was not bothered by it at all and found it flattering) Bought this for mostly hiking/backpacking/camping/dance classes, not so much high impact workouts. It worked perfect for those needs. My ONLY gripe is I think this would actually be better for someone with either a smaller chest than me OR a bit larger. Let me explain. The pads included were pretty intense and seemed to squish my boobs quite a bit since they seemed to take up the internal room of the top. Once I took it out I was MUCH more comfortable. But in general the top kind of flattens and pancakes my boobs a bit? Sometimes I wear a long sleeve over too depending on the temperature I’ll be in, and it makes my boobs look weirdly flat. It’s more ok with just the top on itself. But it does give me a little bit of squished cleavage, I’m not sure how that’s happening. I think if you are smaller chested you’ll get nice cleavage with the pads, and if you are LARGER chested I actually think it will work ok because it seems to force the fabric more outward. So I think it would work out for you in that way. But if you’re in the middle it’s… tolerable if you’re not too worried about squashing the chest. I personally am getting to an age where I am starting to worry about creating a big permanent wrinkle from the line of my cleavage. So I will probably go for the big brand next time. But I think it’s decent. It is starting to pill a little after a couple washes and hang dry, but it doesn’t look that bad and I can get a depilling shaver if needed or use a dull used razor. 3.5/5",95

As someone who values both an active lifestyle and high-quality athletic wear, I can confidently say that this sports bra exceeded my expectations in every way.  The first thing that caught my attention was the longline design, which not only adds a trendy touch but also provides additional coverage and support. The extended band beneath the bust ensures that the bra stays securely in place, eliminating any worries of constant readjustment during workouts. Whether I'm hitting the gym for a high-intensity session or engaging in outdoor activities, the longline design keeps everything in place, allowing me to move freely without any discomfort.  One of the standout features of this sports bra is its wire-free construction. This design choice is a game-changer for individuals who prioritize comfort without sacrificing support. The absence of wires eliminates any potential chafing or discomfort that traditional bras might cause, making it an excellent choice for long workout sessions. The gentle yet effective medium support offered by the GYM PEOPLE sports bra keeps everything secure without feeling overly restrictive.  The padded cups further enhance the comfort factor. The padding strikes the right balance between providing modesty and maintaining a natural shape. I appreciated that the padding is removable, giving me the flexibility to customize the bra's feel based on my preference for each activity.  In terms of style, the GYM PEOPLE sports bra doesn't disappoint. The sleek and modern design, coupled with a variety of color options, allows me to effortlessly pair it with my activewear collection. Whether I'm layering it under a tank top or wearing it as a standalone piece, I feel confident and stylish.  Durability is another noteworthy aspect. Despite frequent use and washes, the sports bra has retained its shape, elasticity, and color vibrancy, indicating its high-quality construction and materials.  This product does run big so size down !!",77
SageMadi,Measurements can be tricky,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6CCAE9X5CN6S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B088M5YWPZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 15, 2023",Color: Denim BlueSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"First of all, I did the bust and seam measurement and mine came out to Bust-33”, Seam- 30”. I am typically either a 34B or 32C. No bra seems to fit me absolutely perfectly. In looking at the dimensions and sizing chart, it seems my best option was to go for a medium size, though I typically wear a small. As we can see in the photos, it is not a perfect fit (these sports bras rarely are for me) and there are some gaps to be considered. The photos were taking from a try-on after opening package, so it’s a bit wrinkled and not flattering in that way, but that can be remedied by a wash cycle.  Onto the gap at the base. On one hand, I consider this a pro, because I deeply dislike that band on certain tops that digs into the skin. When I have a top on, I don’t want to feel constricted anywhere, otherwise it is extremely uncomfortable. In this case, as seen in photos, it actually curves outward in the back, which is not necessarily flattering, but for my purposes of wearing around the house or running errands with a cardigan, it’ll work.  Another pro is the cups and band, which fit comfortably without causing too much compression or pain. Now, if you’re a 34B/32C like me, and in the market for cleavage and don’t care about the side flat boob look and mainly care about the front look, going smaller would be your best bet for that.  When I am seated, there is an obvious gap in the side boob area, and the shoulder bands lift up a little. Again, not a complete deal breaker, but not an obvious fit.  Consensus is that it is a comfortable top for lounging in and providing support if you are going out and don’t want the nips exposed. If you size up and want it to look better, I recommend a cardigan as it will address all of the issues that I mentioned. If you are using for gym purposes, sizing down may be preferable, for compression sake. Ultimately, it is a great top and I can appreciate the comfort at sizing up provided. I, for one value comfort and quality material over look. I work from home and wear this to lounge around, with, and without a cardigan.",192
Horse mom,Did not expect to love these so much!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP0FK3UNJ3N0W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B088M5YWPZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 15, 2024",Color: BlackSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"I have had zero luck ever buying bras online, whether from Amazon or from high end stores - I guess I'm super hard to fit. Let's just say I have a lot of volume and getting that full coverage & comfy fit seems to be impossible. I am also at the age where I have decided underwires can take a hike - I'm going for comfort first and foremost. That said, I don't want to look like I'm overstuffed and popping out of the top, but also don't want the opposite problem of gaping on the sides. I took a whim on these not expecting them to fit. And I was worried that even a XXL would be too small given where these are made. I was shocked that they are PERFECT. I also thought for sure the padding would not suit me, and I'd need to remove and toss those inserts. Nope - not even close. These are amazing and so comfortable. I'm wearing them for working out (at home), and also wearing them as bras underneath my normal clothes. For a little extra support while working out, I did take a hair tie and have my husband gather the two straps in the back and ""tie"" them together. That gave me just enough of extra add'l support. For the price, I don't mind taking this extra step. I've already ordered 5 more. Love these so much.",8

I am a 1X in tops, 2X/18 in pants and weigh about 220 lbs at 5'7"". I carry most of my weight in my belly. Purchased the XXLarge and it fits perfectly with lots of breathing room. The size chart doesn't cover all the sizes offered so I hope the measurements i provided help. I also purchased the 3XL but I didn't even try it on because the XXLarge fits so comfortably. It was really easy to put on and to remove. No struggles at all. It has decent support and a built in shelf bra. It doesn't roll up which is usually a problem with these types of long shirt styled bras. I can see why this bra is a best seller! Sadly, the XXL size only comes in white and black which is BORING. Please expand the colors options so I can buy several of them and replace all my sport bras. This brand has been impressing me with every item buy from them so I hope they continue with quality products.",21

It just has one major flaw. The band on the bra under the top layer of fabric has this weird seam that can be seen through. I don’t know if it is more visible because I have a smaller chest, but it is a major buzz kill. After noticing it, you can’t unsee it. I ordered the denim blue and jasmine green. The green one has the exact same design flaw. It’s just a weird bump pattern showing through.  I love the amount of colors to choose from. The denim blue does show up a little more gray and dark than pictured.  UPDATE: I’ve washed the top 4 times now and although the weird bump pattern is still there, it is MUCH less noticeable now that the fabric has softened up. I am very pleased with the purchase.
