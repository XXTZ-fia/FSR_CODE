I bought this set on sale as my “coming home” outfit after I had my baby girl. I wore this set & sweater a ton while in my last couple months of pregnancy- pants are comfy, stretchy, and versatile even on my big belly. They were long enough to hike up my belly so they wouldn’t fall off (I’m 5’7” & ordered a small). I wore the sweater with maternity jeans a lot & feel like even though it has been washed 3xs as much as the pants, the color still matches really well. Both pieces are thick & kept me warm. I plan on wearing this all winter now that I’m not pregnant too!",4

The top was NOT as oversized as I thought it would.  Fits like a comfortable sweatshit.  The dropped shoulder seams actually pull a bit when laying down and wanting to move your arms when in bed.The biggest negative, is that the red knit of the trim on the top DOES NOT match the red of the pants.  Much oranger.  For a set, I expected that they would match perfectly.  Looks like I bought the top and pants separatelyand from different manufacturers",

If you’re looking for a tracksuit that’s equal parts cozy and stylish, this set totally delivers. Plus, it’s perfect for those days when you just want to feel put together without putting in too much effort (we’ve all been there, LOL).

So imagine my happiness upon finding that it’s ALSO true to size! I was actually giddy. It came just in time for the cold weather. And though the bottoms are white (despite that dumb white/Labor Day rule, white is just a risky color to wear through the wet and muddy months of winter), the top being multicolored makes me feel it’s okay to wear in the cold months. Inside the house where it’s safer, at least (and where no one can fashion-police me). 🤪 And the outfit is super cozy and warm. Super soft inside the top. They did a great job on this outfit, all around.",

The pants fit well though.  There is a stitch/seam down the front of the legs that made me think it was a wrinkle of some sort.  In the end, I ended up returning the set.",

The length of the pants are perfect for me as I have long legs so if you have shorter legs, the pants may be too long. There was no loose threads and the color was beautiful. The sizing appears to run true to size. The pockets on the pants are pretty deep and I like the pleads in the front. This is the perfect outfit to either dress up or dress down and will work well for traveling. I highly recommend.",3
