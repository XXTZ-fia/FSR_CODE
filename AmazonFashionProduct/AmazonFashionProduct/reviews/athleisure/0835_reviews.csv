Nicole V. A.,These pants are fantastic!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X6FT3M99GOAV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BNVHG7W1,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Arrived overnight, and I wore it same day - so comfortable, not tight, cozy/warm AND flattering. I loved the zippered pockets, and I plan on getting another pair. Great jogger style pants!!!!",
fay,Upgrade your sweats,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R70NI3YFJMO1N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BNVHG7W1,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 2, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"These are an upgrade to sweat pants and I really like them. Size is as expected. I’m 5’5”, 160 lbs. I wear 12 to 14 size jeans. I’m usually between a large and an XL. I ordered an XL and they are comfortably loose. Pros: warm, perfect for a walk at 45-50 degrees, wind blocking, very soft and comfortable, dog hair does not stick, (that’s a big deal), didn’t shrink when washed and dried on low. No wrinkles. Look good with a sweatshirt or a nice sweater. Cons: might be too warm for temps above 55 or 60. We keep our thermostat at 66 and I’ve been ok lounging, I got too warm while cooking dinner. While zipper pockets are nice for keeping stuff from falling out, they’re not comfortable to put your hands in and they create some bulk at the hips which I surely don’t need. So, more Pros than Cons for sure. If you spend time outside in cooler weather, you’ll enjoy the softness and warmth of these nice joggers. Worth what I paid for them.",23
Amazon Customer,Unbelievably comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21EZNRHQSQ8CV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BNVHG7W1,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I haven’t worn these in snow or wet weather yet, but I did test the legs under the shower head and they are definitely water proof. That said, they are THE MOST COMFORTABLE snow/waterproof pants I have ever worn. They’re like warm yoga pants, but better. I sat crisscross applesauce for 30 minutes to test the elasticity and no saggy pants bottom. They’re flattering to my shape, are not bulky at all, stretchy enough to wear thermals underneath in snowy conditions, waterproof against a shower head, and they don’t make that zippy sound that regular snow pants make when you walk. They also have deep pockets with zippers so the pockets don’t make the weird flappy bulges that most pant pockets make after you actually use the pockets. I’ll update this post in a couple of weeks after I wear them in Boston winter conditions and wash them, but so far - I need them in all the colors.",11

Quality materials, comfortable, durable, true size fit, not heavy, wash well in cold water, did not shrink when dried on medium heat inside-out, waist ties are bonded at the end and did not come out, elastic around ankle to keep paint down and warmth inside, soft to touch, waistline stays in place when bending-no butt showing, no material odor, and colors still look new after several washes.  This is such a great value for the money. I anticipate these lasting a very long time. I have gotten several compliments on the various colors I've purchased. Easily dressed up or dressed down. Great with sneakers or booties.  One of my best random Amazon buys!!",13

Darlene,Ordering another pair!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FZONIDN24FQD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BNVHG7W1,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,"When I first got this product. It didn’t feel like I thought it might from the description. But they are very comfortable. Especially as the weather is extra cold now. I went for a brisk walk outside and I had to move quick, I did not see an obstacle in front of me and went down on my knee . And went on with my 4 mile walk. I later noticed that I had a large tear in my skin, but not an ounce of damage to these pants except some blood on the inside!  I can’t think of anything else that is a better description of durability and quality of pants. I decided I was ordering another pair in a different color to carry on with my outdoor winter activities.",2
Marjorie Kay,"Comfortable, true to size, warm",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16WQIK4Z5AB8D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BNVHG7W1,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I was looking for something that I could pull on for winter over thermals and leggings.  I didn't want bulky - so far these have really done the jo. They are not as windproof as I hoped, but right now I have 7 degree weather with wind chill. I think these will be great for hiking/walking in 30 degree and up weather.  There is a soft lining on the inside of the fabric for warmth, but I have only worn them layered so far. I really like the outer material is not collecting dog hair like other fabrics. The waist is high, but the drawstring makes it easy to adjust. Overall I am really pleased with the weight, fit and feel of these.  The only thing I don't care for is the vertical front pockets with zipper. I have grown accustomed to more of a side pocket, like on yoga pants, but it's not a deal breaker at all.",5

I like the weight of the material and they’re not baggy or sloppy looking. They’re more of a slim fit which was what I was looking for.  I like that they have nice size pockets and the joggers are lined.  I’m 5’3” and weigh 135 - 140 lbs. and a Medium was a nice fit.  I normally wear a Large but because of other reviews, I took a chance of getting a Medium, and I’m glad I did.  I have bought and returned other joggers and was a little leery about getting these, but glad I did.  They might be a little snug in the waist, but I feel that a Large would be too baggy for my liking.  I ordered a Navy pair and a Black pair and thinking about getting a dark grey because they’re a good value for your money.  I have not washed them, so I cannot comment on shrinkage if any.  I don’t think you will be disappointed if you try a pair yourself.",8

Lucygoosey,Flattering fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NRXV3YRGIG7K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BNVHG7W1,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 2, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Grey Camo,Verified Purchase,"I am 5'8"" 135 lb and I wasn't sure whether to order medium (my waist measurement) or small (hip). I ordered small, and that was the right decision. They are a little shorter than I'd like (an inch or so above ankle), but otherwise they fit well. The waist is not too tight. I particularly like the zippered pockets, well placed so as not to stick out and deep enough for my cell phone. I've worn them dog walking for about half an hour in heavy rain, and raindrops kind of slid off. I do not think they would be waterproof with longer wearing, though. They are comfortable and well priced but not thick enough for extremely cold conditions.",
GigiinFrance85,Too High Waisted,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OS0YKP46M2CH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BNVHG7W1,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Dark Grey,Verified Purchase,I know that these are listed as high waisted joggers. However they are almost too high waisted for me. They feel good (the fleece inside) but they feel a bit odd in the way they fit. They are too big around the butt/hip area which is fine because they are joggers but since they are so high waisted they feel like the waist band is right at my rib cage. I need them to walk my dogs so I’m going to keep them.,
cheryl b,Love these,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3471LR2KKGYKL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BNVHG7W1,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Dark Grey,Verified Purchase,The size is just right. When I opened the package at first glance they looked to small but once I tried them on they fit perfect the material thickness is great. There is no shrinkage when they are washed I feel these pants a very good value for the money. I have since bought a second pair. I especially like the pockets on each side to put my cell phone and mother small items such as my keys in. These pockets are deep and you don’t have to be concerned with anything working its way out of them,
Kels,Good Fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25V1CZB6R2YZX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BNVHG7W1,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,I am about 140 lbs 5’4 in height with an athletic build. I usually wear a medium/large and I ordered a size medium. The medium fits me well. It’s stretchy so it doesn’t dig into my waist or hips. I like the fleece on the inside. They are a tight-ish fit though so I will probably order another pair that is a size Large when I want to layer some fleece tights underneath. I am very happy with this product and I will be purchasing more of these pants.,

Sleek. You can probably get away wearing them to the office on a Friday. I am from Florida and brought three of these for a trip to Banff in January but decided to test them out on a weekend trip I took to Indiana this November. These say they can withstand 20 degree weather but I think that’s a stretch. I wore them in mid 40-50 degree weather and I could feel the cold as if I were wearing jeans or non fleece lined pants. They are on the pricey side for how they are advertised and I don’t feel like they are as warm as they advertise. They fit high waisted. I’m 5’1 and bought an xs. They are good if you wear an additional layer but I don’t think they are warm alone in weather under 50 degrees. I do think they will be nice for a FL “winter” or casual Friday or hanging out pants.,7
