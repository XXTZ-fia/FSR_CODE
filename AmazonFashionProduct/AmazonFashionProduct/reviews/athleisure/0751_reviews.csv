The height of the skirt is ideal (not too long not too short) bra stays in place with light walking, and if you run, it is a medium support bra and still holds everything together. The shorts has 2 pockets and holds an S22 (most of it) it is good if you keep it for a short period of time or if you are shopping or at a night club. But I will not work while running. The material of the short is slippery, very short and no grip around the leg so if you have wider hips, it will go up.
