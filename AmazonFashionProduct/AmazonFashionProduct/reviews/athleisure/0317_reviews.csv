When I open the package there was a large tag that said must be washed before worn so I decided to go ahead and follow the instructions being a tall girl I always wash all of my clothes on cold never warm or hot so I proceeded to wash this sweatshirt with a couple of other sweatshirts and leggings of mine on Cold. I never dry my clothes in the dryer. I always hang them up because I’m always afraid of them shrinking I took the shirt out of the washer, stretched it a little bit and hung it up with a fan on it to dry overnight. In the morning, I tried it on And it had shrunk about 3 inches in the length and about 2 inches in the sleeves. It now comes to the top of my butt. It cannot be worn with leggings.
