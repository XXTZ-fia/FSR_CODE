Just Okay,Absolutely wonderful,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3T79ADZXC5AT7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJBKXPJJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Dark Grey,Verified Purchase,"Love the fabric; soft, stretchy, smooth. Feels great on the skin. Color is as posted. Very luscious dark gray. With the amount of stretch doubtful of shrinkage. True to size. Had I gone up a size, as I usually do, the pants would have been saggy and top sleeves and shoulders would be way off my measurements. Will most likely order in another color. Cost was very acceptable.",
Barbara Quinn,Very comfortable Super soft and lightweight,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BEV5EBUXVHEF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJBKXPJJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Navy Blue,Verified Purchase,"I love this and may order another one!  Very comfortable! I live in Florida so having a lightweight, track suit absolutely works for me.  It runs true to size but it is  stretchy. I ordered a 2XL and the pants are very long. I am 5 ft 9 inches so if you are shorter, you may have to hem them.",
Kjkbean,Really cute !,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKG85X3Y8UHX9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJBKXPJJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 7, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I buy clothes on occasion from Amazon and 75% of the time I end up returning because they aren’t what they were marketed to be. But not this set! I was so pleasantly surprised, the material is soft and comfortable, the collar of the shirt stands up as pictured, and the length is just right (ordered size M, I am 5’4”). Only drawback is the waist, its pretty tight although I like that the waistband is flat in front (not ruched). So basically have to wear the waistband at your true waist to be comfortable. But I otherwise love it and can deal with the waistband issue. Will be great for travel. Got it on black Friday sale which was a great deal for this product.",6
Bettina Boles,Cute and comfy but definitely not worth $50,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LHIVTNUQOSNT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJBKXPJJ,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Pea Green,Verified Purchase,"This suit is very cute and comfortable.

YDWright,Maybe next time/ update review,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R268FRXPYMG0EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJBKXPJJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 26, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Green,Verified Purchase,"This is an update to my review. The seller was very kind and responded. I sent pictures and they told me to request a refund. While waiting, I ordered the burgundy set which is beautiful and both legs are the same length. I feel that the green was a manufactured mess up. The seller made the green unavailable so I’m not returning mine, I’ll just get the legs altered. When I tell you that the green color is sooooo rich and beautiful that I can not send it back without a replacement. Maybe they will get it right and start selling the green again. I give this set a 10.  This is a beautiful lounging set, however one pants leg is longer than the other. I would return it but I wore it trying to make it work. If it was the same I would give it a 10. I pray that the owners will see this and make it right. I would love to purchase every color because it is beautiful material and the color is very rich. Hopefully this was a mishap and they will make good on this purchase hard. If they do I will give an update and change my review.",

I loved the material!  It's super soft!  It isn't thick so I don't think this would be suitable if you're looking for something to provide warmth.  My biggest disappointment however, was that the pants are too short.  I'm 5'3 1/2"" and the pants with the medium size suit were too short. Very disappointed.  Returned.",

When I did, however, I noticed that the pants are about an inch too short. It doesn’t look terrible, but it’s not quite my personal taste. When I went back and looked at the reviews. I noticed that everyone that said that the length was perfect was 5’2” and I’m 5’3” (whomp whomp) I’ve decided to keep it however because I really think it’s so comfortable and it’s fine to WFH, carpool, etc. but the Tyler folks may want a size up. I am going to get a second set, but I will be getting a medium and not a small..",4

That’s what I wanted though. Perfect for plane rides. Some mentioned that the pants were short but I’m 5’6 and ordered a small. Good length for wearing sneakers. Not dragging but not too short either.,

(I sew and I am a fussy clothes washer).  Great fit, well made, superior fabric. Zipper and details in the design and workmanship are quality. I washed it on gentle, cold water with a little clear detergent. Hung to dry and popped in the dryer just to fluff. WILL BE BUYING THIS ONE AGAIN!",

The only caution I would give you is that it is not super warm.  It's perfect for me here in Florida but if I was in a cooler climate I'd want to have some long johns on underneath.  Great for in between seasons or milder winters though.  I want it in a dozen colors I love it so much!,
Addicted to AMZN :),Almost a LULU scuba dupe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GLED9YXKLK63/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJBKXPJJ,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 23, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Let’s start with a good. This fabric feels absolutely phenomenal. Exterior is just silky and you never wanna stop hugging it just like you do the Lululemon scuba. It mimics the exterior feel of the Lululemon scuba extremely well. What kind of fails? There’s not much material. Although it does cover a great deal of the body, the material is actually pretty darn thin. I would not actually trust this to keep me warm on an airplane if I wear just a tank top underneath. Lounge wear really is not my style, but I was interested in seeing if there was a chic way of staying warm on an airplane since I travel quite a bit... I would give this 3.5 stars if I could, still debating whether or not I will send back.. on other points, love the pockets, love the zipper, and of course, the thumb holes..",4
