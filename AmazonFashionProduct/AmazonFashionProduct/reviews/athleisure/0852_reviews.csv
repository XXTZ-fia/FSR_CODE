My girlfriend tried them on and the fit was perfect. The material is every bit as nice as the more expensive pair she had that we laid side by side.,54
Jatia,"Comfortable, breathable, and cute!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1U1O4VANH58HE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BX3S8CMM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 2, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I had been looking for some Avia bootcut yoga pants, that's my favorite brand of athletic clothing. I had one pair and wanted more, but I couldn't find that brand in the bootcut style. So, I took a chance on these, and ended up coming back and ordering another pair because I liked them so much! And I'm planning to buy a third pair. The pants themselves are very well made, breathable, lightweight and have just enough stretch to keep me comfortable while working out in them. The look very nice on and fit really well in the waist and legs (I have a smaller waist, but bigger thighs). For reference my waist is 32in, and my hips are 41in. I normally wear a large in clothes (tops and bottoms). They also have pockets!!! The pockets are decent size and I can put my phone, keys, and cards in them when out on a run, or just running errands and not have to worry about carrying a purse. I've washed both pairs I have and they have not shrank at all. They have held up really well. Also, we have pets in the home and it's not too difficult to just brush the pet hair off with your hands. Literally, the only thing I can think to ""complain"" about is they are too long for me, I'm 5ft. 2in, so, I'm not a tall person. But seriously...for the price and the quality that is really a non-issue. If you're debating, just get one pair and see how you like then. I'm really glad I took the risk and bought them, I might just have a new favorite athletic clothing brand for bottoms!",

Definitely recommend these. No shrinkage in the drier. Not super thick or super thin. Pretty much perfect! I wear them to work and I spend half the evening outside. It got down to 21° a few nights ago and I stayed warm. They are breathable, as well. I will most definitely  order several more pairs.  I ordered an XL (I’m 5’8 180  lbs.)",8

I like that they are super soft, the length, and the pocket for my sell phone.  I also like the colors - I got black, navy, green and gray.  Keep in mind the fabric is thin and although stretchy, doesn't do tummy control.  I have not noticed any see-through.  It's winter now and I think I'll be happier wearing them in the spring/summer/fall than on these cold days.  But I do really like them and am glad I ordered them.",

Lucy,"It is stretchy, I'll give it that.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1I2U1Z4LF9LIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BX3S8CMM,"3.0 "," the United States "," February 4, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Edit: Now that I've had this for a few months, I'll give an update.  The pros: The pants fit better after losing 10 lbs. Although the material is absolutely stretchy enough to pull up comfortably when I first got it, the waistband stopped rolling down after I lost about 2 inches off my waist. Keep this in mind if you're naturally wide-waisted even when the other measurements fit the size chart. It's made from a slick material that wipes clean fairly easily, which is essential as a mom to a messy toddler. It doesn't have a musty or sweaty smell even after leaving it in a gym bag for a week. The merchant was very kind and offered a refund on these pants after my original review. They're very easy to work with.  The cons: The material has pilled quickly at the seat and I anticipate that the material will thin out quicker than other options. I'm still not a fan of the V in front, I've come to learn that a straight-across waistband fits my body much better, but that's subjective.  Original review below. I was looking for a second pair of black comfy pants and this one was half the price of my first pair. You get what you pay for, I guess. I have a mom tummy and was hoping the criss-cross waistband would comfortably contain the extra skin. It doesn't - the waistband just rolls down and highlights my tummy. The pockets are large enough for my phone, but they're a narrow triangular shape, so anything large and not triangle-shaped will slowly work its way up out of the pocket over time with movement. The material is very stretchy, but it feels quite thin and synthetic. It feels like Halloween spandex, kind of ""shiny"" and not very breathable. Apart from this, it's relatively comfy.",7

Kenzie Branim,Consider your skin tone!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MC4Y78HFVVY9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BX3S8CMM,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Khaki,Verified Purchase,"First of all, I am 5 ft, and knew that the XXL would probably be a little too tall. I will have to hem about 3 inches of fabric. When they arrived I was impressed by the quality (they kinda smell a little bit, but nothing the washing machine can't fix). They are not see through even when I bend all the way over, and the material is nice and soft. I will definitely be wearing 3/4 pairs I bought to Disney World. The only reason I won't be wearing one if the pairs is because of the color.  I thought the Khaki color was super cute, but forgot to take into account that I am WHITE. I am pretty pale, and nowhere near the skin tone of the model in the picture. Luckily I tried that pair on in front of my mom and sister. They told me to NEVER wear that pair in public because it looked like I was NAKED. Granted, they are not leggings, and have that flare on the bottoms, but my sister said that if you couldn't see my feet, you would think I wasn't wearing pants. They would be SUPER CUTE on someone who has darker skin, but they are gonna have to be a pair of PJ pants for me!",

I love how they look but there’s a lot of extra space(?) in the crotch area. Behind fits fine, but the fabric definitely pools around my hips in front. That being said, I guess you could consider them reversible because the front part is the same size as the back LOL  Great for the price, however. And I’m just using them to lounge in, so cosmetic things are a non-issue.

Okay, so get these. The crossover waistband is comfortable and sits right where it should. It's not Erkel high and it isn't so long that you're constantly tugging at them like they've slid down. I had a c-section and have a bit of a pooch as a result - these are comfortable and don't roll down or anything.  The side pockets will accommodate your phone AND sit right at the point where you can stick your hands in them if you do that (I sometimes do and they're right at the perfect height to do so).  The wide leg bottoms aren't obnoxiously wide and I actually had compliments and one of the attorneys I work with super excited to see wide leg yoga pants. The length is great - long enough for longer legs like mind but not so long that you're tripping over them. They work with everything from flip flops and ballet flats to high heels and heeled boots.  I wish they were a cotton spandex blend, though. These are an athletic fabric. Not a bad thing - I just bought them for work thinking they'd be thicker and keep my legs warm when the office gets a little drafty. I would absolutely get another pair, though, and just wear heavier socks under them to keep my feet and legs warm!",11

Also note that these leggings WILL pick up other fibers like dog hair or random lint. A lint roller would help if you use them. I don’t know how they wash yet.

Pros- They’re a pretty good dupe for the aerie flare cross cross leggings. From what I could tell, they weren’t very see through. (Passed the squat test!) Very comfy! Cons -They were too long for me. I’m 5’4, and I was wearing one inch platform shoes (pic 2). They just barely missed the ground. They would fall down just enough that I was stepping on the end with my heels. (granted i might’ve got the wrong size) - I don’t know if this is the fault of the leggings really, but they do have a small rip in them(pic 1)I think I got a tiny chunk of something stuck to my knee(it felt like a piece of a skittle) and tried to pick it off, but that tore a hole through. It’s a small hole, so i can definitely just patch it up with some thread. This is just something I noticed. The other thing is, I wore them today for the first time and some of the stitching is coming undone (pic 3). It’s in the pocket. I don’t really mind, but again something I noticed. -last con is the way they sit in the crotch area. When pull up all the way, they wrinkle along the sides of the groin. Picture of like this |v|. The crotch is outlined. It’s not a camel toe, but it sort of is? It looks a little better if the legs are pulled down but then the pants are too long.  Tl/dr: I think they’re def worth a purchase if you’re on a budget. The pockets are a decent size and they are very comfy. I would probably buy them again. However, if the aerie cross waist flares are on sale for 30$, I’d spend the difference and just get those. If they aren’t on sale, buy these!",30
