I was so pleasantly surprised. The fabric was very soft, not like that shiny polyester material. It even has pockets on the sides which I didn't realize it had. Its super cute and not tight; almost too big actually. I could wear a layer beneath it.",10

Bergin,Great top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OLPNHONKIEMJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081XBSKTL,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 22, 2021",Size: LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,"I have several other athletic tops by this brand (Zengjo) and expected this one to be a similar material -- kind of a silky-feeling polyester. It isn't. At first that disappointed me, but I've gotten over it and I really like the cotton-feel of this top. It's very light weight but soft and cozy. I don't see myself using the hood, honestly, but I dig the high neckline; it offers a bit more sun protection for my chest area. The blue color is great (midway between a navy and a royal). For less than $20, this shirt is great and I immediately bought another in pink.  I'm 5'4"", 157 lbs, wear a 40D bra; bust 42, waist 35, hips 43, typically wear between a 12 and a 14 in numbered tops. In this shirt, I bought the large. Fits well -- not too clingy, not baggy. NOTE: I am also short-torsoed and usually buy petite tops (which wasn't an option here), and this shirt hit right at crotch level or slightly above. If you have a normal-length torso, I think it will hit a little higher on the hips.",29

Maybe because it causes a clingy look or seems to get dirty quickly and picks up lint easily.  The fit is NOT flattering. I like a trim cut shirt that emphasizes the right areas. This shirt doesn’t do that. The sleeves are too long, and the neck has way too much excess material. Think it’s probably suppose to help keep you warm but it makes you look like a turtle with its head stuck in the shell. Read about the pockets and thought they would be a nice feature but they make it fit and look bulky in the mid section. Again not flattering, at least not for me, but if you like your shirts loose in the middle and like front pockets to put your hands or keys, etc. this will work for you.  I do like that it’s pretty plain with no visible annoying logo or brand on it. Not the worst shirt I ever bought but definitely not the best. It’s also a bit heavier than I like. Was looking for a lightweight, wicking, tech type of material this is more…idk. It is comfortable enough so might wear it around the house or underneath a light jacket when I know I won’t take my jacket off but it won’t be in my gym shirt rotation.",

The fabric is a little clingy but very stretchy. The neck felt a little constricting but I'm not use to working out in tops with hoods. That's probably something I can get used to.  The sleeves are a little long but not a deal breaker. If you are between sizes I would size up just for the fact that if you have any back fat rolls from your sports bra the fabric will cling to it.,13
