I docked a star only because the size was just a bit off. I wear a size 16 and had taken the advice of others that it would be best to size up so I choose the XXL it fits perfect! It is thicker than I thought it would be and the pockets are right on the sides but aren't unflattering. I do recommend this top!",2
