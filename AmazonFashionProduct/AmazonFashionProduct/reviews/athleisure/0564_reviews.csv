I knew I'd be really tired & wanted a comfy, trendy, nice looking set. This set did not disappoint! It's cozy and warm for a fall morning but comfy enough to wear all day as weather in NY started heating up a bit throughout the day. (I usually get hot and change clothes as weather changes) This set took me through the entire day! I was totally impressed. I have not washed it yet so fingers crossed that it washes well as this is one of my top faves! The top isn't crazy over sized (like most my stuff) and the pants were a bit long on my 5 ft 3"" frame. But that's always the case for me. I have to get used to elastic at ankle which isn't my fav but trendy now. I usually just roll pants up at the waste. Once you wash them, they usually shorten a bit. No weird smell at all. I Highly recommend this set! Buying in more colors!",15

This is NOT see through. This is definitely well made. It is warm & so comfy. I'm fairly lucky because I will be able to wear this to work. So much cuter that the normal suit that is more like hanes or fruit of the loom. Don't get me wrong I still love those because their color wheel has definitely changed and I wear the Men's suits from those brands. But this baddie is definitely something that I won't feel like Rocky Balboas sister in. I want the khaki color really bad. For reference I'm 5'3"" 205lbs. It is a little long.

They don’t taper in, either, so you just end up having this wide blouson effect around your ankles because you can’t see the cuff at the ankles, seeing as how they’re covered up by all the extra material. That was redundant on purpose because it’s worth stressing lol. And I’m 5’7”, so it’s not like I’m super short. While the material is soft enough, it’s not super soft and snuggly.
