I myself am not usually a crop top kind of person,but It always depends on the appearance in the advertised photos. In the pictures it showed even though a crop top they looked long enough that it would be something I would wear.however they got here and after trying the 2 on I found them to be too short for my liking.  Then the pants which are super soft,I wore a pair the first night and they were also too short for my legs and they were bothering my calfskin because they had been too tight.",

I got a size medium and they fit her perfectly. Shes 5’3 and 120 pounds. They are a soft material. They can be work as pajamas, but they can be worn outside as well. I think the price point and this coming as a set of 2 is definitely a bargain They’re comfortable and soft to the touch. I like the colors and they’re easy to wash. They’re light weight so even during the summer months they don’t feel harsh or heavy to wear. The elastic waistband is perfect for her as she grows like a weed and is a preteen , so currently her weight is fluctuating a bit. I do think they feel like a good quality set. I’d wear them myself.",

Surprisingly it fit well. I am 5' 2"" and the length of the pants was perfect. The shirt want really a crop top on me though. The fabric is pretty comfortable, very light and elastic. The waistband of the pants is stretchy as well and the drawstring on the pants does effectively tighten and loosen the waistband. The color of the green set is more blueish than it looks like on Amazon. The white set matches exactly. Cute outfit and pajama set. Nice",

However, I cannot wear them because they have an strong, awful smell to them, even after washing and drying and washing again and air drying and then air drying some more and then washing again and air drying. It smells like someone doused them in gasoline. I am disappointed that they are unwearable. Another thing I wanted to point out is that the material is thin and the stitching is okay and has held up to the washings but I am not sure how long the hems will hold up.",2
