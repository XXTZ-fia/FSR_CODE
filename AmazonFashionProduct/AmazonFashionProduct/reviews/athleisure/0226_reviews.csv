Allison,The Perfect Blend of Comfort and Style,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37IUZMRHT1442/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B083NWZ85L,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"These pants are an absolute wardrobe staple! The lack of a cuff at the bottom gives them a polished look, making them easy to dress up for work or a night out, but they’re just as perfect for lounging or running errands. Fits true to size.  The stretchy, soft material makes them incredibly comfortable—I could wear them all day without any fuss. I love them so much that I now have them in multiple colors, and every pair fits like a dream.  If you’re looking for versatile pants that combine style and comfort, these are a must-have. Highly recommend grabbing more than one!",
T210,Extremely comfortable and well fitting (update 3/2024),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROHRF59GW3HCP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B083NWZ85L,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 8, 2024",Color: BlackSize: X-Small Petite,Verified Purchase,"I have been searching for a replacement of pants like this forever.  I own a pair from a much more expensive brand - that brand was hard to get off and on and not stretchy.  I took a shot and ordered these in XS Petite.  For reference, I'm 5'2"" and 102 - most of that 102 is in the bottom half, legs and rear :).  They are super comfortable and stretchy.  I can wear these to the office with a cute sweater and loafers and still feel like I'm in PJs all day but look like I'm not!  They would be great for travel too.  They fit my hips perfectly.  The one thing I'd change, which won't apply to a lot of you, is that I'd make the length about an inch shorter for the petite size XS.  I have short legs so the length doesn't look like the picture of the model.  They hit maybe a 1/2' above my shoes which looks off.  If I roll them up once it's the perfect length but looks weird because it isn't a full cuff.  If I roll them up twice to make a real cuff then they are too short.  There's no way I'm sending these back!  I plan to go down to the tailor and have her take an inch off.  I looked in to ordering in the XS regular but the hip and waist are larger so the fit wouldn't be as nice for me.  I'll keep these and fix the length for me.update 3/23/2024 - I kept thinking I should give the regular (non petite) XS a shot so I ordered a pair in dark blue.  I have to say, I can't tell a difference in the width of the hips which is good.  I thought, based on the size chart, that they would be much bigger.  But they look just as good and the length allows me to wear them as long pants (slightly cover the back of my shoes) or roll them twice to create a full cuff for the perfect cropped length.  I have short legs and a long torso so the regular length looks nothing like the model on me. They fit like full on regular length pants. The petite comes much closer but still not exactly like the picture.  Over all, I really like them both.  I'm keeping both.",33

The material is soft and spectacular-sturdy and very expensive feeling. Because they are the correct size they are very flattering.  I'm not the type of person that buys pants in multiple colours because I take very good care of my clothes and already have a pair of pants in blue so I don't see myself buying other colours but I do love these.

The quality is comparable to other gym clothes. (My second choice)  The YYV brand has a unique style with a fake zipper flap, a small cut at the bottom of the legs, giving it a smart-casual look, and no elastic waistband. The fit around the waist is great and doesn’t restrict breathing, and the sizing is accurate. Petite friendly. (My first choice)  The CRZY Yoga brand has a tie-waist style like Ajisai. it’s not ideal for petite people as the length is too long and the waistband is too high. (My third choice)  Overall, all the pants are made of similar, stretchable material and can be styled as lounge wear, airport wear, or smart-casual outfits. Good pants for all seasons.",31

The cut and quality are actually quite good for the price, especially if you're not into labels.

I am 5 feet tall and my hips measure 34.5"" on a ""big"" day.  I purchased XS and they are just a tad loose except for the waist, which hits me above my belly-button, just under my ribs.  It's very uncomfortable and seems unnecessary given the drawstring.  I would cut the elastic however it appears to be sewn to the waistband - another detail I didn't expect for the price - and I don't want to rip the waistband.  If I go up a size, the pants would be huge on me.  I cannot wear high-waist pants if the rise is too high and these are too high for me.  Petite is more than adjusting the hem, the rise should be adjusted too because my legs are ""long"" for my height.",7

RE not like travel pants, there are only two deep front pockets. Good for change or a key but you would not want to put bulkier items in there.  The one thing I don't like is that the elastic waist is very tight. It's difficult to pull them past my hips. Once they're up, they fit my waist perfectly. But if there isn't much difference between your waist and your hips, the elastic might be too tight.  And a quibble: I found choosing the size, color and ankle style pretty confusing. I was hoping for the tulip hem, got straight instead. Not a big deal.",21

They’re comfortable, the fabric is flattering and doesn’t show off my cellulite and how out of shape I am. It’s thick and definitely not sheer. It’s stretchy, but hard to describe. I don’t think I have anything else like what these pants are made out of. I like that I can wear them with sneakers and a tee shirt, or put on a nice top to be a little more dressed up. I guess on me they kinda look a bit more like frumpy old lady pants, but honestly I don’t care. I’m 43 and I guess I am kinda frumpy, lol. The length on me is obviously not like it is in the listing photos. I’m 5’ 1” and have a longer torso and shorter legs, so everything is long on me. They’re still just barely cropped pants, and I think they look cute with my clogs. I’m not sure how much I’ll wear them in the winter, but we’ll see. I really love that they’ve got deep pockets. Like, I can fit my entire iPhone XS Max in there with room to spare. If only all women’s pants had pockets like these. I liked these so much I went ahead and ordered a different style of Ajisai joggers that aren’t offered in this shorter length. I’m hoping they’ll work out, but I suppose I can always have them tailored if they’re too long, but I really love them otherwise. I’d absolutely buy these in more colors if they offered them in the petite length. I’m just not interested in navy, although I may buy a second pair in black when they’re restocked. Finding cute pants when you’re short is so difficult. Especially when you don’t like to actually go out shopping and try things on. I’ve worn them several times now, and I’ve washed them and put them in the dryer on low, and they look perfect. They don’t collect lint and they don’t wrinkle easily. I’d definitely recommend them. Just be aware that if you’re short and not as skinny as you could be, (like me, I’m a size 10, creeping towards an 8) then you too are likely to look a bit frumpy in them rather than looking cool and statuesque like the model wearing them in the photos for the listing.",50

After taking the measurements into consideration, I purchased 2 pairs of the black joggers in a petite medium and petite small. I am 5'1"" and weigh 131 pounds so I wasn't 100% sure where I would land between these sizes.  The pants arrived quickly with Amazon Prime shipping and had no issues. The joggers feel silky to the touch and are extremely comfortable. Most importantly, they fit beautifully! Though both the medium and small petite sizes could work on me, I opted to keep the small size because it looks a bit more tailored/less oversized. Despite the fact that these are joggers, they actually look very sharp and I would feel comfortable wearing these in a casual office setting without feeling sloppy. If you're a petite girl who has struggled to find joggers that fit properly, I definitely recommend these!",18

OK if slouchy is what I was looking for.  I also bought them in another color, same size small, and that pair is a little tight.  I'd say that there is at least a full size difference between the two pairs, both marked ""small.""  So sizing is a crap shoot.  If you need these pants in a hurry, buy two sizes and keep the one that fits best.  It's wasteful, but the seller should really have better quality control.",2

Very comfortable, that new light, silky, parachute-y kind of fabric, good weight for travel or working out or casual shopping with a light blouse and jean jacket. No real wrinkling. I am taking them on my trip to Europe to wear sightseeing and on the plane. I figure I can rinse them out, although I don't think I will have to, they aren't prone to wrinkling because of the fabric. However, watch the fit. I am an 8 in most pants and jeans, but bought the large in these based on other reviews. They fit perfectly. Medium would have been too small.
