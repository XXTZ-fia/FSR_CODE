David,Very Comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WPH8YMFIK98X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS1Q9SVF,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Color: Haze BlueSize: Large,,"What I like: The fabric is extremely soft. Haze blue is a fantastic color. The pants have deep pockets which is great for me. I always struggle with finding pants to carry around my phone and chapstick. With these, no worries. The fit is very loose and comfortable.  What I don't like: I run a little cold, so I am not a fan of the sleeveless top. No biggie as I will just add a long shirt underneath. I am sure it is fine for others but if you have the same issue just be aware.  Overall, I am very happy with this outfit and will wear it often. It is definitely worth the price!",
N. Schultz,Not really sweats but really nice,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYHH4P4RMH84A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS1Q9SVF,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Color: BlackSize: XX-Large,,"I was assuming this would be a thick weave and heavy, given that they refer to it as sweats, but it isn't. It's about twice the weight of a T Shirt and extremely smooth and soft. I really like it, but I don't see calling it sweats. It's stretchy and smooth and not too hot for spring and fall without particular sweating. If you want these to keep you toasty in the winter, well, you'll need to layer up with this.  The shirt is a basic sleeveless thing which works very well as an undershirt or over, as preferred. The fit is not tight but also isn't what I'd describe as loose, either. It's right about exactly where things are expected to fit.  The pants are looser, making them less appropriate as an under layer, but making them top notch for PJs. They can work as activewear, too, of course. If layering, their stretch & the general looseness let these work well as the outer layer. The elastic is moderate and there's a lace to cinch it up and secure it. The only questionable choice is the exposed seams, which is a fashion choice, but not a manufacturing defect.  They are made quite well. The lace end caps are metal, even. Didn't see any issues in the seams and such. It's not what I was expecting, but the set is nice.",
GMJ,"So soft, and love the color",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AOXMKAEIQTN3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS1Q9SVF,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: Haze BlueSize: Large,,"This is a really nice two-piece set, love the color! Both the shirt and pants are well constructed; cut and fit are true to size. It's really cold here now, but this set will be perfect for an upcoming vacay where it's supposed to be mid-70s, and of course will be wearing them this spring and summer here. Love that the pants have pockets, and that they are a generous size...won't be worried about the cell phone slipping out. Haven't washed it yet, but similar fabric blends wash and dry well, so would be surprised if these don't do the same. If that isn't the case, will come back and amend this review.",
KC,Fabric is soft and have a good weight to it.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EHPHAFI0X6PH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS1Q9SVF,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Color: Army GreenSize: Medium,,"Got this for my wife. First it is true to size. We have the olive green color and it matches the photos on the listing. The cutting is good, it looks really on her body.  The fabric is soft yet have have good thickness (so it doesn't print everything under it, it's still will show if you have something thick on under) This is more like a summer fabric. The fabric is very stretchy, no restrictions of movement.  Very flattering. She said this will be in her frequent rotation for coming spring.  Came vacuum packed and no odd smell.",
Beth/CarlinWashington,"Not for me, but OK....",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R294BL9XH4LB7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS1Q9SVF,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Color: BlackSize: XX-Large,,"This set was made well and with a nice soft feel, however it is not for me.  What is hard for many women is if the pants fit the top won't and the other way around.  The top was too big for me and the pants I felt were a little too small.  That being said, it is a nice set, you just need to be sure that the size you choose will fit both top and bottom.",
Don C,Great for lunging,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL3SQRHHWIDD5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS1Q9SVF,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: Dark BlueSize: Medium,,"The top fit a little smaller than my wife hoped for so definitely size up for a looser fit. The material is awesome and very soft to the touch, the navy blue color is beautiful in person, and the pants are true to size.  The material thickness is great from spring to fall due to how light it is, unless you live in a warmer climate where you can wear it year round. The only real complaint is regarding the sleeves, they are not as pictured and much shorter on the actual garment. It gives a weird fit to the top.",
Amazon Customer,VERY NICE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16QQ5546MQ8KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS1Q9SVF,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Color: GreySize: Large,,This is a very nice (2) piece lounge set.  The material is super soft and comfortable which is always a big plus for me.  The top is sleeveless so it’s going to be great for the warmer months.  It is made of a lighter weight sweatsuit material that I really like and the inside is lined with a silky type material that even makes it more comfortable.  It hangs well and this could be worn to travel in as well as for lounging.  I am 5’6”/150 and ordered a size LARGE.  It fits well and is in my opinion worth the higher price.  This is indeed a nice set.,

The fabric is excellent - soft and comfy.  They're stylish and cool with the sleeveless tops and wide-leg pants, plus they have pockets, YAY!  The only reason I took 1 start it’s because the sizing runs a bit small, so you might want to order a size up.",
pvf741,COMFORTABLE AND CASUAL,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IMSCMBEOY6A1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS1Q9SVF,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Color: BlackSize: XX-Large,,I am enjoying this set as I can wear it at home or on the go.

It was a good price and I happily recommend this item.,

Let me tell you what my wife thought about this:  Loved ✅ - Super comfy to wear 🛋️ - Perfect seams - Nice material - True to size fit - Love the pockets! - Great for lazy days at home  Not so great 👎 - Wouldn't wear it outside - Just for indoor use really  I'm 5'2"" and 158lb - fits me just right.  Bottom line: Perfect for chilling at home but not fancy enough for going out. Worth the money if you want something comfy! 🏠💆‍♀️",

Brandon R,"Decent Lounge Outfit, But Runs Small",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AZA30TEH6MI9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS1Q9SVF,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Color: KhakiSize: Medium,,"My wife was excited to try this lounge outfit, and there's a couple feature that really stands out: the pockets and the softness. It's material is soft and the pockets are super convenient and a great addition to the design.  However, unfortunately, that's where the positives end for me. The outfit top is quite short and tight-fitting, which isn't ideal for lounging around. I think it runs small, so if you're considering purchasing, you might want to size up.  Overall, the fit and length of the outfit fall short. Maybe others will have a better experience, but for now, it's an average 3 stars from me.",

Very soft and well made stretch material that’s forgiving and flattering. These are advertised as for lounging but with the quality of material, you could easily dress up with a shawl and flats/heels. I didn’t find any flaws or defects in this set. I will definitely be packing for an upcoming trip.",
