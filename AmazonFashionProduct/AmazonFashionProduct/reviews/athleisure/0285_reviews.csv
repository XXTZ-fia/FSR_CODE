The neckline had a notch, which I didn't see in any of the photos.  And the bottom elastic is a bit more snug, which makes it sort of bubble.  I'm tall and slender, but this made me look kind of fat and had an odd puffy fit.  I like the thickness of the fleece, though.  I think this would be really cute if it just had a straight fit, without an elastic at the bottom.  And no notch on the collar.  I ordered 3 sweaters, and really thought I would love this one.  But kept the other and am returning this one.  Looks like other people had better luck with this, though.  With easy returns, it's worth trying if you think you'll like it.",6
Amazon Customer,"TBH, I’m a fan",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R232MRDQN4V9U3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C5RDHPVQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 4, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Coffeegrey,Verified Purchase,"I’m 5’4’’ and 120lbs; I’m a true small and I got a size small. Fits great. Originally, I got the tan one, and I liked it so much that I went back and bought another one in purple. This is NOT one of those deals where you think you are ordering a sweatshirt and end up with a thin, cheap t-shirt material donation bin addition. The material is thick and super soft on both sides. The neck is cozy too—it’s loose enough that it doesn’t feel constricting like a turtle neck. It’s still in the 70-80s where I live so I haven’t had a chance to wear them in public yet, but my yankee husband keeps our house in arctic temperatures so I HAVE worn them around the house, couch rotted, and slept in both of them and have zero complaints. Both have been washed twice on normal cycle in a mixed bag of color clothes with a splash of fabric softener and have not shrunk, worn, raveled or faded. I’m pretty happy with these. It’s difficult to justify buying more of them since I have a million hoodies and sweatshirts, but the green one IS currently sitting in my cart just waiting for my next hormonal online shopping spree 😉",69
EVictoria,The color washes off after spot treatment!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13GATYM8QP9GQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C5RDHPVQ,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 6, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Greygreen,Verified Purchase,"The material is fine, although the overall look of the sweatshirt looks cheap, nothing special. My biggest issue was that after wearing it a few times I got a few small stains that did not wash off after doing laundry. I tried to treat the stains again with the ""Missy Mouth"" spot treatment which always works like a charm (even on my 100% silk skirts), but after rewashing the sweatshirt with the pre-treatment it left these horrible discolorations! That has never happened to my other clothes before, so it seems the material or the dye they use is terrible.",3
