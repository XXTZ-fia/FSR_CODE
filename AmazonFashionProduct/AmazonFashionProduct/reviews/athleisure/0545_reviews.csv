The pants are an adjustable drawstring closure. I ordered this in the size S and it is true to size. However, it runs short in the pants. I'm 5'6"" for reference and these hit me above my ankles - not the look I go for with sneakers, ugh!! The lower mid-section to the waistline on the pants is too short and creates bunching.
