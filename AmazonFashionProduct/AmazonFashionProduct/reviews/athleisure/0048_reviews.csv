I’m not a fan of synthetic fabrics and cotton seems to be getting harder to find so I consider this a win. The stripes down the sides add a fun detail and make it stand out from other sweatsuits. I subtracted one star bc the pant's rise is higher than it needs to be and the length is likely going to be somewhat problematic for me. They aren’t quite long enough to be full length on me but too long to look intentionally cropped. One inch longer or 2” shorter would work better for me. I’m going to make them work but it’s not ideal. For reference: I’m 5’ 7” and a size 6. I’m wearing a small.,

I might however see if I can wash and dry the pants on extremely hot wash and dry to shrink them on purpose. I ordered a 2X hoping to get an oversized, draped look to the sweatshirt and it has that exact fit which I love. The pants however are huge on me, but luckily they have a tie string to cinch them up. I still wont wear the pants as the legs are like extreme bell bottoms. The width of one of them alone is almost as big as the waist. That’s not a flaw of the pants as they are shown with a baggy, wide leg, it’s just not for me. Luckily I have a sewing machine and will maybe make these into more fitted pants.

I even like that I can sit down and roll up the pants a but if I want- if I get too hot. The pants are have the right amount of roominess in the legs- they are neither too tight nor too baggy  Later, I put the sweatshirt on and it fit just as nicely as the pants. I am very happy with this outfit, the feel of the brand new sweatshirt insulation on my skin feels terrific and though I know it won't last forever ( good feeling fabric, as you have to wash it eventually), I get the impression that the sweatshirt is gonna remain comfortable after washed and time (because as you get older and go through tons of clothing, there are some things you learn ;).  I highly recommend this item- as it is what it appears to be on Amazon, plus it feels and feels great- along with keeping you warm (so good for winter and cold indoors during the summer).

The sweatshirt is much less loose so together it looks like an odd fit. The navy set has light blue stripes on the side. I thought they could be white in the listing pictures. The fabric looks a bit cheap in person so I am going to only wear around the house.  Because the pieces look a little off when worn together I am going to wear them separately. Overall, I am disappointed and would not buy again.",
