Let me start by saying, WOW! These leggings are an absolute game-changer when it comes to style, comfort, and versatility.  First and foremost, the fit is simply impeccable. The stretchy fabric hugs my wife's curves in all the right places, accentuating her figure beautifully. Whether she's running errands, hitting the gym, or lounging around the house, these leggings offer the perfect blend of support and flexibility.  Not only do they look fantastic, but they also feel incredibly comfortable. The soft, breathable material keeps my wife feeling cool and comfortable all day long, even during intense workouts. Plus, the high-quality construction means they hold up well wash after wash, maintaining their shape and color with ease.  What really sets these leggings apart, though, is their versatility. The three-pack offers a variety of colors and styles to suit any occasion or mood. Whether she's pairing them with a casual tee for a laid-back look or dressing them up with a stylish top for a night out, these leggings effortlessly transition from day to night.  Overall, I can't say enough good things about the 3 Pack Capri Leggings for Women. Not only do they make my wife look absolutely stunning, but they also provide unbeatable comfort and style. If you're looking for the perfect addition to your wardrobe, look no further than these leggings – you won't be disappointed!",13
Charlie,"Comfy, big pockets",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PP2U791I3BH7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D474BS4H,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Size: Large-X-LargeColor: Black/Blue/Pink,Verified Purchase,Super soft and comfortable.

KP,Soft,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21DVLB9PTGT9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D474BS4H,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 2, 2024",Size: XX-Large-3X-LargeColor: Black/Dark Gray/White,Verified Purchase,"First the negative, if you can call them negative. While it says tummy control waist, I do not notice any kind of tummy control at all with these leggings. But that is fine for me, as that wasn't a feature I cared about anyway. - The pockets are mainly why I purchased these leggings. Admittedly, I did not pay a lot of attention to the photo showing the pocket placement on these leggings. All other leggings I have purchased with pockets have all had the same placement, on the side of the leg. So when I received these and found the pocket to be more on the front like regular pants I was surprised. That is my fault. These pockets are made inside of the pants with extra fabric, while the side leg pockets on other leggings I have put the pouch outside of the legging so there is no extra fabric inside. If I am explaining that correctly. So I am adjusting the fabric often as it gets bunched. The pocket is somewhat deep. It almost covers my iphone 14 plus. Walking a lot, or bending over, or other movement makes the phone move up in the pocket and at times fall out. This does not happen with the other legging pockets on the side of the leg. My entire phone fits in those and does not move when I am gardening or anything else. - I also found that I had to pull the leggings up more so they settled correctly on my waist and in the crotch area. So doing this made the leggings higher up on my leg than I wanted, unlike the photo shows. I am only 5'4"" and my legs are not very long. So this was a little disappointing as well. - However, overall, I am happy enough with the purchase to not return them. The colors are very nice, the size is perfect, they are so soft, and the waist does not hurt with all day wear. If my little quirks don't bother you, then I would recommend them.",6

They stay up fairly well but not the best I have  had.They are quite thin, which might be good in hot weather running errands. I personally like wearing yoga pants a little thicker when I am out in public- they look more put together. But these are good for working out or lounging around because they’re such a good price.

It makes it even more awkward when you put your phone in your pocket. Definitely need a long shirt or hoodie if you intend to wear them in public. Hey! But they were affordable and they are soft. Update: I came back and added a few stars. I've worn and washed these quite a few times now. They seem to be holding up pretty well and they are still soft. They are comfortable so I'm looking to buy a 3 pack of the full leingth. The dark colors you can't see the pockets as well as you can with the grey.

It makes them bunch up and look ridiculous The cons are that they are not really think but they are by no means transparent. If they have spandex in them it’s not what’s most in them. I say that because they are so soft and buttery and may get picked easily if you have a pet with claws.  When I sit they bunch a little bit around the top where the pockets are. Loose like. I don’t care for that. They don’t hold you in with mulch support at all but are good for everyday around the house or casual running around. I won’t buy more. When I really like a product and know it’s gonna last I will buy more. Not these.  PS…. Cat hair DOES stick to these like crazy.
