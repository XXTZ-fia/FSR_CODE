Carrie Grubb,My new favorite for casual wear and pickleball!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROQ4Z77FS8D5B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XXDCHFZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 10, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"Light weight, sweatshirt type fabric.

kar,Perfect for everything!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R1YNSTCGY3QL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XXDCHFZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 17, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I am not a shorts girl.  I personally am self conscious of my large thighs, thanks to my Russian, German, and Iralian ancestors.  I inherited the short and chubby thigh genes.  I like skorts because the lining keeps some thigh from rubning. Chub rub is real!!  Most skorts are on thevery short side, so if sitting they do not give a good coverage.  If you think it is just a skirt, it looks a bit inappropriate. I usually size up on skorts just to get a little more length and more linin as thigh barrier.  Since skort are my go too, I  wear them gardening, out with family, bbq, and want to for church, though they are often to short for that.  Some are also heavy material, like jeans.  It is not a lighter fabric, but more year round.  I was so excited to find these!  I have worn them sooooo much in the month I have had them.  Fabric is soft and light weight, but not see through.  The short linning is longer than standard shorts.  I no longer have to worry about the skorts riding up.  These go day to night, depends on what you pair with.  They have gone from long car rides, to running errands, gardening, even going to church.  This item is so versatile!  My mom even wants a pair now.  I will be getting more of these in the future.  I cannot tell you how happy I am with these.  They also are comfy for long rides/trips.  I am had many surgeries and am going back on chemo.  They feel great on skin that I have texture sensitivity with and soft for chemo sensitivity and possible long infussions!",17
MissTam5,I love it. Good value.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31TE4HGACJX7X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XXDCHFZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 2, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I need to order one in every color. This checks all the boxes. Modesty: it is a great length to be grown up and modest. It does ride up a bit when you sit down, so if you are looking for ""Pentecostal level"" modest, this is not going to be long enough. Value: great price, good product. Cool and very comfortable. I don't want to wear anything else. It has pockets! The only downside is the cheap jersey fabric which pilled up quite a bit after the first wash. It only looked dressy and classy for the first wear. If you are looking for something ""put together"" or looking for a moderately dressy occasion, this is not it. It looks casual and sporty. If you desire A more modest alternative to wearing shorts or if you want to feel like you are wearing sweat pants only cooler (in both senses) this is what you need. The size was on the smaller side of just right. I wear a 16 and this was a body hugging but acceptable fit. I will probably size up next time, though. If you are slim or if you have skinny legs, this will probably hang well on you at your regular size. If you are pear shaped, big thighed and/or wish to conceal a belly, you might want to size up. It has a tie waist which will help if your waist is relatively small.",

Shayndel Park,"Love the look, BUT....",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XN0M4ZPG42FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XXDCHFZ,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 15, 2022",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Ok... so this skort is really cute on. I'm fairly short (almost 5' tall) and ordered a 2x. I probably could have ordered a 1x and been fine, so maybe it runs a little big on the hips, but not bad at all. The skirt falls slightly below my knee (because I'm short) but I'm OK with that because I would prefer my legs be covered anyways. I love the pockets and the length of the shorts under the skirt.  The problem is that when you wash and dry it, SOMEHOW the entire waistband gets twisted up and the drawstring gets wrapped around the twisted waistband (internally). I have to meticulously maneuver the string and the waistband to straighten them out each time I wash and dry. If I don't do this, the waistband does not lay flat and using the drawstring scrunched the fabric up oddly on the side.  Could I lay flat to dry? Sure. Been there and done that. But the waistband still gets twisted in the washer, too. Plus, these are athleisure so washing and drying should be a given. I have them in gray and black, and I will keep wearing them because they are comfortable and cute, but I will also cramp my hands up fixing the waistband every time they go in the wash.",17

I ordered an extra Large and it was simultaneously bulky and tight - both in all the wrong places.

I do recommend tying a larger knot on the strings as the slits they come through do not have a grommet so they can easily revert inward.
