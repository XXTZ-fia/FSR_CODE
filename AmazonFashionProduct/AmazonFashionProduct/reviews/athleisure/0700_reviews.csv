Emilie H.,"The perfect pair, a review of comfortable and stylish pants",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12KIIAEE2U6GV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCVFLXYY,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 3, 2024",Size: LargeColor: True Navy,Verified Purchase,"In the realm of fashion, the quest for the perfect pair of pants is often akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. With countless styles, materials, and fits available, it can be a daunting task to find a pair that meets all of one’s criteria for comfort, style, and functionality. However, I recently discovered a pair of pants that not only fit me perfectly but also exceed my expectations in terms of comfort and design. Standing at 5'8’ I have often struggled to find clothing that fits my frame without compromising on style or comfort. Yet, these pants, which I purchased in a Large, have proven to be a game-changer.  From the moment I slipped into these pants, I was struck by how well they fit. The combination of a well-designed waistband and a comfortable stretch fabric creates a silhouette that flatters my figure without feeling restrictive. The waistband is notably chunky and features a drawstring; although I find that I do not need to tighten it, the option is there for those who prefer a more customized fit. This thoughtful design element enhances the overall comfort of the pants, allowing for ease of movement throughout the day.  One of the standout features of these pants is their length. As someone who often finds that pants are either too long or too short, I was pleasantly surprised by how perfectly these fit my height. The length is on point, striking a balance that allows for both style and practicality. Additionally, the positioning of the pockets is well-considered, laying flat against the fabric without adding bulk. The subtle detail above the back pockets adds a touch of flair, ensuring that the pants are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing.  The material of these pants is another aspect worth noting. Made from a windbreaker-like fabric, they offer a unique combination of durability and breathability. I had the opportunity to wear them on a particularly hot day, and I was impressed by how well they managed to keep me cool. The breathability of the material allows for air circulation, making them suitable for various weather conditions—a quality that is often hard to come by in stylish pants.  In summary, these pants have quickly become a staple in my wardrobe. Their perfect fit, comfortable fabric, and thoughtful design features make them a versatile choice for any occasion. Whether paired with a casual tee for a laid-back outing or dressed up with a stylish blouse, these pants effortlessly transition from day to night. I wholeheartedly recommend that anyone in search of the ideal pair of pants consider adding these to their collection. They have certainly elevated my style and comfort, proving that the right pair of pants can indeed make all the difference.",4

The price is about the same as some I bought during the pandemic at another store. These come in many colors, and I ordered the wrong one. The Ink Grey is more of an off-black. I am going to return them, but I ordered the Mysterious Grey and the True Navy. I think they have four different greys and at least two shades of blue, so color is not a problem with these.",2

They look great on me and are so comfortable.  I just bought another pair.  I love everything about them but two things that were a little unexpected which you should know are that (1) they don’t come down quite as far on the calves as shown in the picture (but not much higher - it’s cuter actually) and (2) the material is a little bit unusual - my son said it feels like a swimsuit and he’s right - they are very soft to the touch - but not in a bad way.  It’s not like a swimsuit at all but it is unusual. I like the softness of it a lot.About the size - I am 5’8” and 145 lbs and I bought a L which fits me perfectly.  I usually wear sizes 8/10 so if I had followed the sizing guide I would have gotten a medium.  Glad I did not.,

(By the way, I ordered the casual jogger and lightweight jogger in an XS and they both draped very nicely.) I returned the lightweight jogger because I didn't like the feel of the material. I am pleasantly surprised by this brand and will order other colors.",

They are exactly what I was looking for, slimish through the legs and excellent length. I'm 5'3"", 146lbs, size 6/8, and I don't have much of a waist (my body is kind of straight and not curvy). These end just below my ankles and are somewhat high rise. I love that the drawstring is stretchy, so I can just pull them off and on while having them still hug my waist. I wear these every day to my job in physical therapy. They pair well with a polo and don't look overly casual. They also wash well, but I haven't put them in the dryer though.",3
