I love that there are no itchy tags to bother you!  Features: Love the added thumb hole in the sleeves to help keep the sleeves down and secure.  Fit: On arrival the shirt sleeves were a couple inches too long but the shirt shrunk some after I washed and dried it which resulted in a great fit! The sleeves were the perfect length after washing/drying! However, and the reason for the removal of 1 star, the torso is very short. If I’m wearing high waisted leggings it just barely covers the top of the leggings on the sides. If it was normal rise leggings, your skin would show. Especially on your sides because of the swoop up detail in the shirt at the sides.  Overall, nice quality shirt, but I really wish the torso of the shirt was longer. Would highly recommend if that’s not something that bothers you!",3
