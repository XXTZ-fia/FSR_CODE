I ordered it on 12/12 and it arrived today, 12/29. The product page did not mention that this was an international shipment.  The color (J08 -pink) is not as appeared in the advertisement. The color I expected was pale pink/purple ombré. What I got was more of a baby pink at the top.  The fabric was not described on Amazon, but the appearance seemed to be cotton or cotton blend. What I got is a very cheap feeling polyester, with a synthetic fleece inside. The only label on this is for size. There is no fabric or care label.  I feel duped. I trust Amazon to have vendors who sell quality merchandise and are honest about the product. Of all the issues here, the cheap fabric is what angers me the most. Don’t buy this product.",14

So these are Christmas gifts and of course I have to wait for them to get them before I know if they will fit them? So as of now I’m only giving these sweatshirts a 3 and that’s being generous. The colors are black, Wine, Purple, and Navy and none of them look like the selling picture. Please see attached photos of the colors.",2
