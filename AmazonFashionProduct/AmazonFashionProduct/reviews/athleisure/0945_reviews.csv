My biggest problem with these is they're not nicely tapered at the bottom like they are in the pictures. The bottom cuff is nice but there's so much extra fabric gathered above the cuff. Really giving harem pants at the bottom.  Conversely, they're pretty snug in the butt/ crotch/ thighs for joggers. The outline of the pockets is clearly visible due to them being so snug on my thighs.  I like the material, but the fit is all wrong for joggers. I saw that another reviewer had the same complaints about a new pair they got vs an older pair they had. Did they change the pattern or did I just get a poorly made pair? Like the actual seams and everything are fine it just seems like a different garment than shown.  Confused. Sad. Oh well 🤷‍♀️ I got them for $10 on prime day so I'm considering keeping them for around the house as long as the butt/thigh area loosens up since I do like the material. They want like $30-40 for these usually though? When you might not really get the garment shown?? Idk. I guess returns are easy. Good luck if you gamble on these!",
