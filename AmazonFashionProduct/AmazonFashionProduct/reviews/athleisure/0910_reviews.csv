Liz,Adorable comfy outfit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LMQBHTMH067T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CBKN1V23,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 7, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Beige,,"I absolutely love this outfit. It's so comfy and looks nice. Perfect if you want to look put together but also feel like you're wearing pajamas. I'm 5'2 125lbs and the medium is perfect for me, the pants aren't too long either which is a huge plus. I will say the fabric in the pants is a bit thin so can't wear dark colored underwear but that's to be expected for the price point plus it's a nice, light material you could wear in the summer. I'll probably buy this in another color.",8

Kevin Holt,super comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22FUS1ZCRYXJG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CBKN1V23,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Beige,,"This is super comfortable, and is made with quality stitching.  It is definitely for leisurely wear, as the fabric is a little thinner than I expected and therefore doesn't do a great job at keeping you warm in any amount of cold breeze.  I am 5'00"" and 140 lbs and I ordered the large and I really should have ordered the Medium.  however, the length is fine which is always much appreciated when you are 5'0""!  You can also wear the pieces separately for more versatile use.",
