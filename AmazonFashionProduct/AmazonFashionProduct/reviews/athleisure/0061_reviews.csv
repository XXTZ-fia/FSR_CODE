They go down to mid butt in back and give plenty of room through belly area. I’m also large with the girls (40ddd) and they have room too. It’s not a tent though - comes in at the waist slightly to give a good shape. I also like the patterns too.  I’m usually an xl to a 1x - this shirt fits like a 1x so I would say it’s a little large?  But then again all Alfani brand shirts I wear are xl so it depends on brand.  If you typically wear an xl I’d go with a large.,
