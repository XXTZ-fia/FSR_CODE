Amazon said a large would fit me best.  Nope.  Needed an extra large. It’s a snugger fit than I expected.  The fabric was not what I expected at all.  I thought it was more of a sweatshirt type fabric, but it has more of a slippery feel to it.  It’s warm like a sweatshirt, and about as thick, so that’s not a problem.  It just surprised me.  On the other hand, I don’t think it will pill like a cheaper sweatshirt does.  I would buy again in a larger size.",4

The material is a heavy t-shirt weight.  Nice for spring/early summer or fall wear. I personally would not wear during the winter because I like material that provide warmth.  If you like the t-shirt look with a little design flair, you will like this shirt.  I purchased this because my favorite color is orange and it’s hard to find clothing in that color.
