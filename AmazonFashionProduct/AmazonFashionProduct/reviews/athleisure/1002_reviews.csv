I’ve washed them multiple times- no discolorations, no shrinkage, no pilling! Soft and hugging stretch, not a firm material so it moves with your body. It doesn’t seem like it would be as secure as it actually is. I do sometime cover my chest when bending over because I feel like there can be a bit of open gap between breast and bra but not by much. Wouldn’t be my first pick for deadlift days. The straps do not slip off even when running. It has a shelf bra and after every wash I never have to adjust the little pads, they just stay in place, so that’s really convenient. I do a lot of running in these and so with all that bouncing I NEVER have to adjust this top during my workout, it’s my #1 top for my big cardio days or back days (to see the muscle). Give it a chance, it might turn out to be your favorite! So comfy.",
