They are so close to perfect but just miss the mark. I love the material it’s soft and not see through! Great! However….the size smalls material is slightly thicker and more athleticy. I’m 5’2” and they hit right below the belly button. Perfect! Downside they run long. One other big problem for me though is the smalls are pretty small and as soon as I size up to a medium they are big and I mean big. :/ it feels like there should be a size in between the two. My other issue is that the material gathers behind my knees which is uncomfortable. So love the material and the lower waist. But such a sizing issue.,
