The ribbed material feels comfy and supportive, but it doesn’t have a ton of give, so I do wish I’d sized up slightly for a little extra comfort.

Ary,10/10 Highly recommend!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWXLNR882VDOP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09H4RH2P4,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 6, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Dark Blue,Verified Purchase,"UPDATE: I also ordered the grey set. It’s a bit different than pictured but still nice! I added an image of it next to my previously purchased navy set for comparison. By the way, I washed it without issue (no color bleeding, shrinking, etc.). I air dried one but the other was accidentally dried in the dryer on a regular cycle but nothing happened to it so I consider these to be of great quality.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: I’m 5’9, 150lbs, and wear a 36C bra size and this fits great! I’d purchased two sets (navy and black) and I felt comfortable during my cycling class and strength training. I have yet to try this set for yoga but I’ll update this when I get the chance.  The point is that this set moves comfortably with my body and I’m not constantly adjusting my chest area during my workout. I was dripping sweat but it didn’t show on the set (possibly because of the colors I picked). I could feel it absorbing sweat but there weren’t any stains or anything so I was pleased.  The high waist looks great and creates a slimming effect so I’ll definitely be purchasing again in every color 🩵!",15

I tried pulling the bra down some to fix the bra straps falling down and didn't help. That's only reason I didn't give five stars. Otherwise I love them and great for working out. Super cute.

Her twin is thinner and uses it occasionally to run. So on less muscular legs, it doesn’t roll so much. On muscular legs, it does. As to sheerness, nothing shows through/or is visible.
