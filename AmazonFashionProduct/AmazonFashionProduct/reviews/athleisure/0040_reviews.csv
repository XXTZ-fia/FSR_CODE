Pamela Dickinson,"Super cute, well made",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD5R0MUD0LT5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CT1B15WG,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 22, 2024",Size: 12Color: Light Blue,Verified Purchase,I got a size 12 for my 6 year old grandson.  He's all there...I thought they might run a bit small and I was right.  He is between a 10 and 12 and they fit great.  A little bit long on him but that was expected.  It's a very nice outfit and comfortable!,

He routinely selects it when we tell him to find something to wear. The quality seems quite good and it holds up well to the wear and tear an 8 year old boy would puts clothes through. It was initially bought for a trip to London and it kept him warm on the chilly evenings.,

dmck,Looks great and it's so soft! May run small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2V14HOPAL7PUJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CT1B15WG,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 15, 2024",,,"This is a nice and lightweight sweatsuit set. The material is smooth and soft and feels great. I like the streamlined and modern look and feel of this set. My son is really happy with it. The pockets all have zippers which is such a nice feature to keep things secure as my boy isn't always mindful of his belongings. The waistband is comfortable and the tapered legs keep the bottom of his pants from getting dragging on the ground. I got the laurel wreath color which is like an olive green and it's a nice neutral color that's not too dark but not too light that it will easily stain or look too dirty. That said, I think it may run slightly small. I got a size 12 but my son who is 10 and on the smaller end will likely grow out of this quickly. I wish they included a size chart with measurements!",
Jacob  Hantla,Super soft and comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D6QN42SDEW09/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CT1B15WG,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 20, 2024",,,"Our son loves tracksuits because they match, he doesn’t have to think about it, and they are comfy. Who doesn’t? This Reebok set was the quality I’d expect from Reebok. The fabric is buttery soft. They are so soft, that he's worn these as pjs a couple times. The cuts and stitches are all as they should be. No loose stitches, threads, or uneven seems. Will definitely be getting more of these because he is growing like a weed. He is a bit tall for his age (9)  4’9” and exactly 80# the size 10 fits perfectly, but won't fit for long, so size up.",
