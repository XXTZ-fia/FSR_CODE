C Love,Stylish Yet Snug - Size Up,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2X3M3PY4CMKYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F9LDRL3,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 30, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: Dark Purple,Verified Purchase,"I recently purchased the cute stylish yoga top, and while I am pleased with certain aspects, there are a few considerations to keep in mind. The design of the yoga top is undeniably adorable, and its stylish flair adds a touch of fashion to my workout wardrobe. The patterns and colors are vibrant, creating a visually appealing look that stands out in a yoga class. The fabric used is of high quality — breathable, lightweight, and comfortable against the skin. It offers excellent moisture-wicking properties, keeping me cool and dry during intense yoga sessions.  However, my enthusiasm is tempered by the sizing of the top. I ordered my usual size, but it turned out to be a little too small for my liking. I recommend potential buyers consider sizing up for a more relaxed and comfortable fit.  Despite the sizing issue, I must acknowledge that the top performs exceptionally well during yoga sessions. The stretchy material allows for flexibility and ease of movement, and the cut is designed to stay in place, providing the coverage needed for various poses. The snug fit may work well for those who prefer a more body-hugging style, but it's essential to keep personal comfort preferences in mind when choosing a size.",14

I believe this brand has another style with some mesh at the top and I prefer that but I still bought this style in 2 colors. The length is longer than some of my other tops.

These tops have become a stylish and practical addition to my workout wardrobe, and here's why.  First things first, let's talk about the design. The cross backless style adds a fashionable flair to these tops. The open back not only looks trendy but also provides extra ventilation during workouts, keeping me cool and comfortable.  The racerback design gives me freedom of movement, making these tops perfect for various exercises. Whether I'm hitting the gym or practicing yoga, they never restrict my range of motion.  The fabric is lightweight and breathable, allowing me to stay focused on my workout without feeling weighed down. Plus, it dries quickly, which is a big plus for those sweaty sessions.  I appreciate the versatility of these tops. They pair well with any bottoms, whether it's leggings, shorts, or joggers. They're perfect for both active and casual wear, making them a practical choice for my active lifestyle.  The only reason I'm not giving them a perfect score is that the sizing runs a bit small. I recommend going up a size for a more comfortable fit.  In summary, ICTIVE Women's Cross Backless Workout Tops are fashionable, breathable, and perfect for any active woman. The open back design and racerback style provide both style and functionality. Stay cool and stylish during your workouts with these trendy tops. Just remember to size up, and you'll be good to go!",12
