Melanie,Feels like swimsuit material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O7GKWRZDJEB2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKX8SM5,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Size: 4XColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I was not expecting these to be the material they are. I had read through reviews and saw “buttery soft” as a description in which this is what I was wanting. I would not describe the feel as buttery soft. These feel like swimsuit material. I feel like I’m going to go surfing in these. I’m probably sending back but it has peaked my curiosity to how these would hold up as a modest swim pants lol. And I’m partially tempted to keep to find it lol  They also do not feel like they breathe easily. I’m a very textile type of person and I’m not fond of the material at all. It feels like plastic on my legs. I was wanting more of a comfy, around the house, knit pair of leggings. These are definitely designed more for working out. But I have concerns about how well they breathe. I only tried on so I can’t say if they do breath or not.  If I liked this type of material, I might like these. For this specific type of material, it feels like a higher quality. The fit is very nice. I am a plus size and many brands get super wonky on the sizing for plus. The size runs similar to Torrid sizing. It feels like it has a little bit of tummy control in the front. Nothing too terribly restricting though. Just some mild smoothing out properties. It surprisingly has a lot of stretch. When I first opened, I thought they were going to be very restrictive. It felt like they were conforming to my body. They are kind of thick fit leggings. Some leggings can be super thin and see through, but these were not.  For what they are, they are nice. This is why I’m giving a 3 stars despite not liking these. If you’re wanting this type of fabric, if you can call it that, I would recommend. If you don’t want to feel like a seal, I don’t recommend these. For me, there are far more positives than negative BUT the material really is a deal breaker.",

These are heavy and not at all see through. I tried bending and squatting in bright sunlight, and my husband said that nothing shows through. These smelled bad when they arrived. It wasn’t really a chemical smell, but something akin to a faint vomit smell. Gross. One wash fixed that, and they washed up nicely. They are soft and comfortable and quite warm.
