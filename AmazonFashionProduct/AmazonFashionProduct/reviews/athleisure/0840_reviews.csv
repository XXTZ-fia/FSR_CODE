It was very tight. So I'm not sure if the other are normal for a size S or if they were sewn differently than the gray one. The material is super soft and stretchy. Overall I love them.

The sleeves were far too tight and small (to the point that the material twisted and sat weird on my arms) and the small cuff at the end was too tight.
