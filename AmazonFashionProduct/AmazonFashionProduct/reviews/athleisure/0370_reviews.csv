Laney,Comfy but Cute Everyday Set!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R258VR8X337DVZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09WVK6QB1,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Pink,Verified Purchase,I love love love this set. I have it in almost every color available. The material is good quality and it is super cute yet comfy making it good for numerous occasions. The material is quite stretchy and will mold to any body type. I ordered a size XS and it fits good. The only thing is the back of the top has a little room by my bra area.,
Cierra,Cozy summer loungewear,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG671AHEOE0YD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09WVK6QB1,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 26, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Green,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this in a size medium though a large may have been more comfortable for the top. The top fit, but was a bit too snug for my liking for a lounge piece though the material is comfy. The bottoms fit true to size. I am 5’6” and 135lbs with a 36” bust and 29” waist. This outfit is perfect for a casual summer day out walking the dogs, running errands or just lounging at home. The material is a waffle knit, light weight but quality material that is not see through. The color is as pictured and described. I’d recommend but if you’re bustier, I’d size up!",4
Allyson Salvucci,Great lounge set,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13G6QDOESNKU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09WVK6QB1,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 27, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I work from home and was looking for some lounge sets that would be good for the summer months. I’ll say, I’ve ordered over sets in the past that DEFINITELY wound up being home-only lounge sets because of belly or booty coverage but I was so pleasantly surprised by this one! I’m about 190 lbs, 5’6”, hour glass figure and was torn between L or XL. I wound up going with the L and I’m really happy that I did. Perfect shorts coverage, just a small bit of my torso showing, surprisingly flattering. I’d be comfortable throwing on a denim jacket or cardigan over top and running errands. Oh and pockets and a true drawstring are a HUGE bonus.  4 stars because I think without the little discount I got using Prime, this set would be a little overpriced. It’s not the softest material upon first wear…like that waffle fabric. But it at least has nice structure. I can’t imagine it will hold up for a long time but, we’ll see!",4

I wish I had ordered one size larger for the top - as there is little to no stretch. The shorts have good elasticity in the waistband and are extremely comfortable.,

It’s super cute and so comfy. I feel like I wear it more than my other chill/pjs. The top is pretty short so if you are a heavy chested girl you won’t be able to lift your arms in it so be careful. The color has held perfectly and it’s a decent elasticity so it has for me perfect at different weights,

I am 5’9”, 180 hour glass shape (40, 30, 45). The size chart recommended a size L. However, I went with an XL so it would fit looser. I’m glad I did. Plus I wanted to account for shrinking after washing/drying. The material is more of a waffle texture. Not cotton knit or sweat pant material. Out of the package it smells so bad. Like play dough. I will definitely be washing before wearing. Overall I’d recommend this as loungewear. It looks like pajamas. I personally wouldn’t wear it out but people wear pjs outside these days so to each their own.",2
Hatchmando,Runs small.

I still kept it but would have ordered more colors if the top was more size appropriate for the bottoms. Also feels more like a $20 price point- but inflation so… Im a medium/large (more a typical large right now) and had to exchange for an XL. The shorts are a bit baggy but luckily that’s in. Im 5’2”, 160lb, carry weight all over. Short n stiocky. I don’t think I’ll wear it alone without an open blouse over it in public bc Im 48 and my mid section is not in shape. The top is def cropped. But will be super cute with an open white blouse etc. (for those using as pj’s- I would not use as pjs bc top not loose & cozy. Too constrictive for me and not soft enough) But overall cute.  Another thing to note, it arrived in its original bag with no shipping bag over it. I didn’t love that. It felt like it could get stolen because you see what’s being shipped and left (more tempting) as well as might get dirty if things get inside the easily to open package.",4
Poundcake921,Loving the lounge!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38GROGVBWZ4OM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09WVK6QB1,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 21, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"I ordered a size large; the shorts and long cardigan fit perfectly. Everyone is right when they say the top is cut really small. If I ordered an x-large the shorts and cardigan would be too roomy but the top would fit better. I have large breasts and I definitely would have to wear a bra underneath for my nipped not peak under the bottom. But since it's for lounging I'm not going to be too picky but I would definitely wear the top separately with sweatpants, high waisted pants/jeans or Midi skirt (with bra of course..lol!? It's very soft material and I'm tempted to buy another one in a different color!",

There also isn’t a lot of stretch in the top, so the bottom hangs loose-ish instead of hugging your body.
