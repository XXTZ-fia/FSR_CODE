Amazon Customer,So comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJY4ZKKTZBM1W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09MYCW9W2,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Size: SmallColor: White,Verified Purchase,So comfortable! I ran a half marathon in and was complimented on while doing so. It was so flowy and didn’t have to worry about adjusting it while running. I was a little self conscious about the opening in the back.,
1K9Savvy,Beautiful Color and Very Comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YNFAXOVONABE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09MYCW9W2,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 23, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Light Blue,Verified Purchase,"Ordered this shirt in Light Blue and its gorgeous/attractive and so comfortable !  The length is exactly as its shown on the photo - at the waist/belly button. I love the thumb holes which don't tug or pull on me - exactly right. The back is a bit sexy but still very practical. I washed mine and dried it on delicate cycle for only a short time - then hung it up to finish drying which is how I wash most of my workout clothes that are rayon/spandex. I didn't notice any shrinkage.  I'm 5'4"", 137lbs, and ordered M which was perfect.  I loved the cut so much that I've ordered 2 more (black & army green). Also, my order arrived super quick even with it being just a few days before Christmas.",
Susan,Adorable!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2K56L4DVNZ6HH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09MYCW9W2,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 6, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Winered,Verified Purchase,"This is the cutest!! I bought a similar one from Fabletics this summer and paid $75 for it. I honestly think this one is better. Great product for the cost!! I am 60 and love to wear trendy clothes but realize my body is not what it was 30 years ago. It is long enough your tummy and/or back is covered, but still short so it looks great with high waisted leggings over a cute sports bra or cami. I have gotten lots of compliments on this top. I ordered a large and it fit perfectly.",
Sarah,Great!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JEIK4TJSSEFI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09MYCW9W2,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 27, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Light Gray,Verified Purchase,"The fit of this cropped top is spot on. It’s designed with a slightly snug, yet flexible feel, which gives you a sleek and flattering silhouette without feeling overly tight. I ordered my usual size, and it fits perfectly—there’s enough stretch in the fabric to move with me during workouts, but it doesn’t feel loose or saggy. The long sleeves provide nice coverage, making it ideal for cooler days or for layering, while the cropped design keeps it light and breathable, so you don’t feel weighed down.  The fabric itself is soft and smooth against the skin, with just the right amount of stretch to keep you comfortable whether you’re stretching, running, or doing strength training. It’s moisture-wicking, which is a must for me during workouts, and it keeps me feeling dry and fresh throughout my sessions.  Material & Quality: The material of the Bestisun cropped top is a blend of polyester and spandex, giving it a smooth, lightweight feel. It has a bit of a compression-like effect, which makes it feel supportive but without restricting movement. After multiple washes, I’ve noticed that the fabric holds up well—there’s no pilling, fading, or loss of elasticity. The stitching is also solid, which is always a good sign of quality.  The fabric feels breathable and allows air circulation, so it doesn’t trap heat, making it perfect for high-intensity workouts or warmer conditions. Even after sweating through a tough workout, the top doesn’t cling uncomfortably to my skin, which is a huge plus!  Design & Style: The design is simple yet stylish, with a clean, athletic look that pairs well with high-waisted leggings or shorts. The cropped cut hits right at the waist, providing a flattering look that adds a bit of edge to any outfit. I also appreciate how versatile it is; you can easily dress it up or down. Throw it on with a jacket and jeans for a casual look, or pair it with leggings for a yoga or gym session.  It’s available in a range of colors, and I opted for a neutral black, which goes with everything, but the colors available are all vibrant and trendy. The long sleeves offer a bit more coverage compared to typical short-sleeve crop tops, which is ideal for colder weather or if you just prefer more arm coverage during your workouts.  Performance & Durability: In terms of performance, this crop top does its job exceptionally well. It’s great for a variety of activities, from yoga and Pilates to high-impact cardio. I’ve worn it for everything from weightlifting to running, and it’s stayed comfortable throughout. It doesn’t ride up or shift around, even during more intense movements, which I really appreciate.  The durability of this top is also impressive. After wearing it several times and washing it a number of times, it hasn’t lost its shape, color, or elasticity. The fabric still feels as soft as the first day I wore it.",
