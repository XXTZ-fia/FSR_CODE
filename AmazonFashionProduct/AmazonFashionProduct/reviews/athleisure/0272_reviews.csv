The material is super soft with almost a silky feel. Love the jacket, the pants are a bit more wide legged than I prefer but will probably keep it. Very comfortable and will probably wear it on travel excursions. Color is a classy beige.Oh and I wish pants were a bit longer. I’ll definitely wash in cold water and hang up to dry.  If pant shrank in length they would definitely be too short.  I’m 5’7, 158 and bought a medium. Perfect fit",10

Very luxurious.  The fit is fine.  Quite standard.  I wish it came in petite size so i didn't have to hem my pants.  I didn't pay attention to the waist band.  It's thicker than I would like it. But the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that the jacket had no pockets!!!!! THAT is weird.  A tracksuit is meant to be versatile activewear.  How can the jacket have no pockets?!  I was shocked when I realized it had no pockets.  If I hadn't already cut off the tags and hemmed the pants, I might have returned the item.  That was disappointing.",2

That being said, the color in dark gray is not at all charcoal, but more of a deep mouse gray with taupe undertones.  I'm 5'7"", regularly a size16, and I got the XL.  It fits very loosely and as expected. The biggest issue is that the pants are an inch too short and graze the tops of my shoes.  The jacket is a shorter style, as depicted.  The zipper is substantial, and the item is well-constructed.  The fabric is lightweight, very soft and feels nice next to the skin. This set machine washes and dries beautifully.  No iron was needed. Great set for the gym, around the house, running casual errands, layering during cool weather.  It needs a longer inseam and the color seemed off from the online photos.",13
