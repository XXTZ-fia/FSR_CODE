Finding joggers that fit both my lower legs and waist is the world's most complicated task. These 4-way stretch golf joggers are the first joggers that fit my body type great, while also being extremely comfortable and durable. I ordered the XL with the 30 inch inseam. The length is perfect as well. The material offers the perfect amount of thickness and stretch, and does not feel cheap at all. I've put them through about 3-4 washes already and they quality remains the same. The quality of these joggers make them an absolute steal at the price they're sold for. In my opinion, CRZ yoga joggers are almost/just as good as more expensive luxury brands for a great price.",

Coincidentally my husband said “oh those look nice” so I ordered him a pair…he immediately loved them and said “I wouldn’t mind having a few more pairs!” FYI he has a bunch of “travel /athletic” pants from bike, Banana republic, Dicks, and target. These are by far the best. Obviously never tried Lululemon because I haven’t been able to justify spending $100 on one pair but I would imagine they are similar.
