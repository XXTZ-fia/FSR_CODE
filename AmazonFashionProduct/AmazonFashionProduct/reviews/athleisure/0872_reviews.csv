Amazon Customer,LOVE!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQVP1R0GCMSAI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DPKLYFB7,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025","Fit Type: Regular 27-29""Size: MediumColor: Black",Verified Purchase,I absolutely love these pants. They are classy with an athletic look to them. The zippers on the side that are gray really add to the joggers . They do not get static at all. They’re the best soft smooth material. They’re the perfect length and fit. I’m 5 foot eight medium build and they seem true to size. I ordered a medium and they fit like a glove. Definitely going to look into buying other colors. You can’t go wrong with these best pants. I found online yet.,

Not for winter wear but perfect for what I want/need them for. I’m used to ordering big name brands like Nike etc. and these pants are by far worth the price! I’d wear these as lounge wear! These pants have excellent zipper and velcro quality for their price! They do have some stretch as well. I’m getting two more pairs! I will say, I’m a mom of two kids and I’m not perfectly in shape.

I got the Khakis in medium to be safe and they are a bit looser than id want for day-to-day but the extra looseness was perfect for my hike through the grand canyon. They were super comfy. Had space to fill all my pockets which was needed for the long hike. There were parts of the hike where i got them wet from the river to cool down and they dried fast as advertised, perfect for cooling off but not having to hike in sopping wet clothes which was perfect!  Then i got the red in medium to see if theyd fit and they fit perfectly for just going out, regular workouts, feelin cute, smaller hikes etc, just a little more flattering. But now im going to eventually own all the colors because i just adore these pants! Theyre also so much more breathable for the lady bits than leggings, which is so important to me. These are my new staple. Buy them. For my small pair i do air dry them just to be safe but i dry my mediums in the dryer because i dont care if they shrink a little but i have not noticed that they have. Hope this helps!",35
