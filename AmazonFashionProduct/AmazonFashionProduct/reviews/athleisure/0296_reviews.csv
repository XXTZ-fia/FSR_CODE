Florence Smith,Too long,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NESD1W27U30H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZ7N6D4,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 22, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Navy Blue,Verified Purchase,Nice top but long enough to be a short dress. Nit flattering to me. I had a size large but could have used a medium.,
DawnH2008,Great for under shirts for added length,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4AQXYLUGHINU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZ7N6D4,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 9, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Wine Red,Verified Purchase,I bought this to wear with leggings & under another tshirt to add length for colder days. I’m 5’5” 145lbs.  I bought a large red even though medium would have fit fine also. I didn’t want it tight. Material is soft & stretchy and loose but not too loose.,
Joanna Chanin,Great fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27PF7GESF05E9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZ7N6D4,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 3, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I layered this tank top over a more form fitting one. I like long and loose  tank tops that cover my tush for workouts at the gym.  I always order a size up, so this fit perfectly with a little give.",
Amazon Customer,Low quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10QJ1W2LOJ24L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZ7N6D4,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 26, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Wine Red,Verified Purchase,"The product is comfortable but the quality of the sewing is low, check photo",
VNoble,NOT Loose Fitting,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OWTZRNCQOF14/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZ7N6D4,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Dark Heather Gray,Verified Purchase,"These are not loose fit at all. They're more of a fitted tank that is longer. If you have a little bit of a belly, definitely order up a size if you want a more loose fit. Overall quality is good and they're super soft. They fit well but I may exchange for a large for my own personal comfort and preference.",
KMK,Athletic Top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P9FOIAZ5B4SW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZ7N6D4,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Light Heather Gray,Verified Purchase,Nice quality,
chasyb,Nice tops,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2E35J4J0K0CEU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZ7N6D4,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 31, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Navy Blue,Verified Purchase,"Nice long tops, covers hips and butt.",
Kelley G,"Length good, wrinkles bad",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R62XMZG7E4S3K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZ7N6D4,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 22, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Gray Green,Verified Purchase,"This has the length that I like, but they wrinkle so bad! The wrinkles come out after you work out and get a little warm. I won't buy again, but I'll use them while I have them.",
Maureen,Exactly what I was looking for.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UR3Y6REMHX7M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZ7N6D4,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 10, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Gray Green,Verified Purchase,I have been looking forever for this shade of green and finally found it. I love the top not just because of the color but the fit is good too. The top is comfortable and washes up beautifully. The color choices are really nice and perfect for all workouts. Good purchase.,
Katrina,Long length and great material!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KJP98DO4VL05/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZ7N6D4,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 19, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Gray Green,Verified Purchase,"I am 6'1"" and usually wear a US size 12-14. I ordered this shirt in an XL and it literally covers my entire butt! I prefer shirt lengths to be around 30 inches long. I don't think a large would have worked as it would be too tight at my hips. It doesn't sag either at the armpits which is a pet peeve of mine. The green-grey color is beautiful and the fabric actually feels nice and soft. It could easily be a workout top, or cover it with a cardigan for the office. So happy with this tall-approved find!",3
Andrea krause,Perfect,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Q1RB5T2J9ZTD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYZ7N6D4,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 17, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,Love the length and material,4
