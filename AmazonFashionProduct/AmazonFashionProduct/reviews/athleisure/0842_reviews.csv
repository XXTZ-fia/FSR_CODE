It was very form fitting and showed all my lumps and bumps.  It fit snuggly into my arm pits.  The picture shows the model wearing a longer and loose fitting shirt so I returned it for a large.  Fits just as I wanted it to and I love it.  The little peek-a-boo opening on the back is so cute.  You can see on the model that her little opening actually is baggy so she's obviously wearing a larger size than normal.  If you are in great shape and like a snug fit, order your correct size.  If you prefer not to show your imperfections, think about ordering up.  It's comfy, a cool fit and works well when I'm active.",4
