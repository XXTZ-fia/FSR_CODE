Now for the big BUT...they either come perfectly packaged or mostly a horrendously wrinkled, balled up SHOVED into a bag MESS!!! No joke, nearly impossible to get the wrinkles out and they look God awful that way on. I've tried everything to get them out so now I'm on the fence as far as returning them. I get that they're shipped from obviously different sellers but ZERO QA inspection. I'd be fired if my products were sent out in such a manner!!!

I bought size medium. I’m 5’ 6”, and 135 lbs. I’m 58 years old, so for those of you ladies over 55 you know weight migrates to the middle. 😜  I bought three pair (2 black, 1 navy), however each pair was different from the other. Different type of fabric, different in sizing, and different and quality of sewing. Yet all three have the same label as if manufactured in the same place.  The waist on the navy pair is 1” smaller than either of the black paír, and the fabric was not cut correctly so the seam twists around on one leg. The length on both (regular) was perfect and lands right at my ankle when standing. Pockets are deep and easily hold my iPhone 14 Pro. I washed all three in cold, delicate cycle, and hung to dry, and they wash up perfectly. No pilling, or weirdness, but one pair of black is a lovely Lycra feel, and the other is thicker and scratchy.  I’m going to order a couple more pair and see what I get. I’ll let you know.",10

I tried them on and they were a perfect length. Perfect. It hit right at my ankles. I did notice strange dark lines in the fabric on the front thigh area. I reached out to the seller and asked and they said it should wash out. And they did in the wash. I love that they are high waisted, have pockets and even a zippered pocket on the back waist area.

These pants are dope. The material is a great weight… not at all see through but also not likely to make you overheat as you do your thing. They have a high waist which is a nice nod to the current trend but it isn’t unflattering for those of us who lived through the high waist trend the first time. I think the best part about these pants is the length. At 5’0”, joggers typically look like genie pants on me & I usually need to fold over the waist or roll up the cuffs just to look like I’m not about to give out three wishes to whoever is next to me in the grocery line.

I received this pair yesterday and here are my thoughts:  Pro: 1. Color options are virtuously infinite and price point is excellent. I ordered the khaki, but was going to consider other colors if the fit was right. 2. Fabric is lightweight, but opaque, doesn't show panty lines, very stretchy, nice drape and soft to the touch, just like the Athleta joggers. 3. Lots of pockets: slant (not bulky) pockets in the front, one zippered pocket over the lumbar spine (for keys or a very tiny pet maybe? too shallow for a phone). 4. Length works for me. I am 5'2"", the bottom sags some which is totally fine with me, even gives it a bit of a cool vibe. This pant should easily work for average height women, lengthwise.  (Only one) Con: 1. The waist is a tad tight. I ordered a medium which is what Amazon recommended and, while the fabric is overall very stretchy, the very top of the pants where it falls on the waist has a double seam on the inside which gives that area much less give. Picture of waist unstretched is attached. I don't think I'd exchange it for a large, that would probably be too big.  In all, I've decided to keep these and see if the waist thing becomes a non-issue later.  For reference, my natural waist is 30 inches and I wear a size 6 in Athleta joggers.",119

They are great because they come in different lengths. I opted for the petites which was perfect for my 5’3” body. However, the attention to detail just isn't there. Both pairs of pants are full of bunches of threads both inside and outside of the pants. The one pair I received had very clearly been opened and returned. They were wrinkled beyond words. If you don’t mind purchasing something and then trimming the mounds of threads left behind by the manufacturer, buy these pants otherwise, move on.",6

These are quite the same (you do get what you pay for) but they are soft, nice fit and the length is great. I may end up getting another for variety but how many pair do I actually need?",
