I'm glad I'll be able to cover up my arms and chest when under the hot sun. Will only be able to wear with a specific pant as it is so short, but that is evident as advertised. FOR SURE size up... these run small and shrink in the first wash, even when air-dried on cool.",2

The sleeves were very tight, and binding and the stomach of the shirt kept riding up. The shirt is plain and not much unique about it.",
Idalia Castro,Cute and comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2M1RZ9FMBKL2L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCYHCM4C,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 8, 2024",,Verified Purchase,The color Haze Blue is pretty and the fit was just right,

LindsayO,"Wardrobe staple, great for day to day wear or workouts",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D1E7Z2OEPO0I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCYHCM4C,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Awesome material and quality. If it had a lululemon or alo logo on it, people would happily pay $100 for this shirt. It feels akin to the quality you’d find at those stores. It’s super soft, a bit thicker, but also dry-fit and stretchy. I’ve only washed it once but it feels sturdy.",2
Gary Groth,Wash it before using,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4EEQ2A6IHZDI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCYHCM4C,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 23, 2023",,,The material is very soft and stretches easily.  Out of the package the material feels more like a soft raincoat material which was very disappointing.  Once it was washed however it felt much better.  They didn’t have X-Small size but the Small fits pretty well with just a little too much sleeve length.  Overall it’s a very nice workout top.,2

It's made of athletic material and is moisture wicking. It fits true to size and as expected. It's not transparent. The color is right. It's very comfortable on. It's well made and great for work outs or any kind of physical activity that will have you work up a sweat. It's, also, comfortable just to wear in general. It looks great and feels great. I have zero complaints. Great value!",

It's extremely lightweight & the size small is perfect on my granddaughter.  She loves the thumbholes on the sleeves however we're not real keen on the neckline as it shows bra straps stop she'll wear a small camisole or tank top underneath.  There's a nice stretch to the fabric & it's allows freedom of movement without being binding.  I like the quality & for the price I recommend this shirt .,
LMT,Just OK shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LQRB2Q1L2MLM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCYHCM4C,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2023",,,"I was a little disappointed with this workout shirt. My normal size, medium, did fit as expected, but the material feels cheep. The sleeves are a bit long but it makes sense if you put your thumb through the holes at the bottom, which I did in these pics. I am not sure when I will wear this, other than maybe layering but I doubt I’ll use it as an actual work out shirt.",
Michala,super,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RI4S6CJNBUJ76/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCYHCM4C,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 20, 2023",,,"The loose fit is incredibly comfortable, providing the perfect balance of freedom and coverage. The thumb holes add a stylish touch while keeping the sleeves securely in place during workouts. The white color is vibrant and hasn't faded after multiple washes. The medium size fits me perfectly, and the quality of the fabric is exceptional. Whether I'm doing yoga or hitting the gym, this top has become a staple in my activewear collection.",
mindysue11,"Comfortable, flowy workout top that you can wear around town",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D2SYSHCMOJHI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCYHCM4C,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 16, 2023",,,"The texture of this shirt is super soft, and the fit is stretchy. I like that the abdomen area doesn't cling to me - it has room for air flow. It is not the thinnest shirt I own, but thin enough that you MUST wear a good bra with the pink color if you will be in public. Must. The hem is slightly longer in back on purpose, which adds a stylistic element if you care about that sort of thing. The price is a tad higher than I would normally pay for a workout shirt, but I like its flexibility to be more than just that. It's comfy enough to wear while working out but transitions easily to running errands.",
Suitsme,Cute top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RN0AUA22DPVDJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCYHCM4C,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 16, 2023",Color: PinkSize: Small,,"I am 5'4"", 115 lbs. for reference and the small fits me perfectly. It's loose, breezy and flowy, comfortable and breathable...not restrictive at all.  The pink is not pink at all--it is a true peach color which is unfortunate because that is not my best color...I wish I had ordered this in black. Overall, it's a great little top. I love the boatneck neck line, so flattering...just be aware that you will show your stomach if wearing it for a fitness class, when raising your arms...it is too short to tuck into joggers or what have you.",3

Isai sapien,"Weird neckline, otherwise great",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GAG8TMLR5CL9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCYHCM4C,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2023",,,"My wife’s review - I sized up one (from normal size L to size XL) so that it wouldn’t be such a cropped fit. I am pleased to say that worked! It’s a very lightweight shirt, perfect for a cooler day. I wore it to an outdoor expo for about 3 hours, and my only complaint is that the neckline fits odd—almost like the boatneck top. I kept tugging on it so it would come down off my neck. Otherwise, I really did like it.",

I really like that. It fits loosey and I am usually a M/L and am glad I got the large with this one so the sleeves are long enough I can put my thumbs through the holes for my hands. I washed and dried and it didn't shrink. This shirt seems to be very well made and fits great with leggings! Would be a great crop top to layer or even wear with jeans.",2

The material is thin, soft, lightweight, and airy. The arms are a nice, long length and it has thumbholes. The top has a slightly cropped fit but perfect with high-waisted shorts, pants, or leggings. I am not a huge fan of the boatneck however, as it shows the straps of my sports bra. Otherwise, this is a really nice top that I'm sure I'll be wearing often.",
Colinda,"Stretchy shirt, rather thin. Made in China.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17UX95BOUSZ3R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCYHCM4C,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 8, 2023",,,"This shirt is listed as a crop T-shirt, but it is not short on me, because I am only 5’ 2”. I got the pink color, but it is more of a light peach.  This had an odor when I took it out of the plastic and it was also quite wrinkled, but it was okay after I washed it, although still a little wrinkled. The tag advises do not tumble dry, but I think it would be very wrinkled without the benefit of the dryer. I tumble dried it on low and took it out early.  The fabric is soft and very stretchy, surprisingly stretchy for something that is only 5% spandex. Also, I am surprised that something of mostly natural fibers affords UV protection because most UV protective fabrics are made of polyester. I don’t have a way to test the fiber content, but it does not look or feel like 45% cotton.  I have a strong preference for natural fibers, both because they don’t get static and they don’t shed microplastic into the wash water like polyester does. I hope I was not misled by a translation error.  The fabric is thin, but not see-through.",

This shirt is comfortable and has a relaxed fit, with a longer hem in the back and a shorter cropped cut in the front. I love that this allows for more airflow when I’m outdoors playing pickleball in the heat. And I love that the long sleeves offer sun protections, and that the thumb holes keep the sleeves from creeping up. Overall this is a really functional shirt that I know I will get a lot of use from.",3
