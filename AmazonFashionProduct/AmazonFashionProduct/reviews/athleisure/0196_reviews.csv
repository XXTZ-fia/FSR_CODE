Lizzette,Love it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMXHZ0C4ZLJPL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SWJHBJZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 19, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I don't often write reviews, but I just had to. This shirt is perfect! The material is wonderful! It is soft and it drapes nicely. I could even dress it up and wear it to go out and it's perfect for the gym. It is slightly sheer but not see through (which I actually wanted to show off my sports bra a little). It is well made and it shapes the body just perfectly. I generally buy a small or a medium depending on how I want the shirt to fit. I'm a 34D and I bought a medium and it does fit a little big on the armpit sides. I won't be returning this one but when I purchase again (which I certainly will) I will probably select a small. If you're thinking about it, just buy it, you won't regret it.",

They also allow free range of motion which is great for me when lifting weights. They have held up great through many washes.,
AtoZcustomer,Great for workouts but cut is long,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OXUZP5WJKLEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SWJHBJZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Green,Verified Purchase,"I bought this (in several colors) to replace some other tops I bought on Amazon a year ago, same style, but these are quite a bit longer in length.

Justine,It’s actually a terrific shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXLBJ3APGO3H3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SWJHBJZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 14, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Burgundy,Verified Purchase,"I bought 2.  The red is a medium.  The blue is XS.  I bought it for my daughter but it was too big on her, so I kept it.  Maybe my next one will be a small.  🙂They both fit nicely, depending on whether I want it loose and flowy, or more fitted.  I am 5’10”, 135 lbs.  the top is soft, and well made.  I actually do intend to get one more.  If they had more colors I liked, I would probably get more than that.  I might use it as a work out too, but I really like it with jeans too.My only complaint (besides not enough color variety) is that the straps are kind of close together in the front, as if it were made for someone with narrow shoulders (why I thought it might work for my very lean 14 year old).  Most straps land over my bra straps.  Hard to tell in the photos, but thee straps are nearly an inch in.Still a great top.  Recommend.",6

I have worn it twice for my walk/runs. However, I noticed a really weird smell straight out of the package. I washed it and it seemed to go away. I aired dried it and it seemed to take forever to dry. Not a good sign for a workout shirt. Also both times I wore it and I got sweaty, that really strange smell came back. I know it’s not me because none of my other clothes smell this way. Whenever it gets wet it stinks really bad. Thinking of getting rid of it or just not using it to work out in. Very disappointing as it’s a pretty shirt.",

occasionalBuyer,Meh...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L74WDQ4GYCXA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SWJHBJZ,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 25, 2022",,Verified Purchase,"5'4"", around 142-144lbs, 34B-C, waist: ca. 29-30""; hips: ca. 38-39"". I bought a size small, and it kinda fits, just not as expected...  So, I have a very similar top from a different brand that has a high crew neck instead of the V that this one has, but with an open back, just like this one (only curved, as well, not a ""V""). I love the other style! Color, flow, everything! But I wanted to try a V-neck, and the other style doesn't come in light purple, which is one of my favorite colors to wear.  My problem with this one is that the V-neck-line comes up awkwardly narrow leaving some flabby material around the armpit area... I don't want to try a medium, because even the small makes me look quite like a brick not really narrowing at my waistline. I realize I have wide shoulders and back, — maybe it isn't a problem for someone with a narrower statue...  I will keep it, as I still like the color, and if I wrap the shoulder straps around my sports bra's straps, the front kinda drapes the way I wish it was in the first place. I just have to keep adjusting it, hence the 3 stars. (I can't seamlessly alter the strap length, it would be too obvious and I'm not paying another $20 to have it done. ;))",7

Itsame,"flattering for hourglass figures, and soft AF",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F73JWR9F3GF6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SWJHBJZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 21, 2020",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"My bodytype etc: I'd like to say this top was such an unexpected surprise! I hardly ever have success buying clothes online because I fluctuate in weight so much. I have trouble finding tops that flatter my figure when I'm carrying extra weight around my middle, because my shoulders are the same width as my hips. Tank tops are either too boxy or blobby on me, or they cling to my stomach (thereby forcing me to do the TC Tugger dance. If you don't know what TC Tuggers are, Google).  The good stuff: This top is sooo soft, flowy, and falls right off the curves in all the right spots! It's also sexy af y'all. Hides the tum curves, hugs the good curves! I loved the first one I bought so much, I had to go back and order one is every color. I will admit, I bought the beige color first, and I LOVE it, but it reminds me of a dusty rose more than beige. Looks cute braless or with a cute bralette underneath. This is my new go-to top for everything--from working out to going out (when we can *go out* again).  Bottom Line: If you're looking for some cute quarantine tops to spice up your pj or lounge wardrobe (because you're not really going out or anywhere interesting yet), this is your new top. If you're looking to turn heads with that sexy back in the grocery store because your mask covers your face, this is your new top! If you're looking for something comfy but also sexy, THIS IS IT. If you're looking for something loose-fitting for workouts, this is also it. Honestly, wear this top in any scenario, and you'll be happy.",18

Jenny,"🤣  this is the thinnest ""opaque"" shirt I have ever bought and that is saying a lot!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PPEVNNW1OCBR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SWJHBJZ,"1.0 "," the United States "," July 25, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I understand this is supposed to be an exercise shirt, which would imply it is breathable and it is because it's THIN AS FARK... but ... it's not made of active wear material (the black one is 70% modal, 30% polyester) which makes it look and feel incredibly cheap.  I did buy it with the intent of using it as a workout top so it shouldn't matter so much that the coverage is poor, I really just don't like feeling like I'm being taken advantage of when it comes to price and quality. At the time of purchase, this shirt is being sold for $20 and it is honestly worth $10 (even with inflation and all those shenanigans). This shirt does not spark joy.  As far as the fit, it does seem to run on the smaller side (this is not a problem I usually have-- I do try lots of clothes-- so I'm assuming it is the shirt and not me gaining weight). It is not cut in a flattering way-- i.e. the back fits well like if I bought the next size up then the back opening would look large and awkward-- but there is no flow or movement in the front of this shirt. If you are bloated in any way it will show.",
