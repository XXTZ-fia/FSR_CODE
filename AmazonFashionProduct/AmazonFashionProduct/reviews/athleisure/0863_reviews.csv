Joseph Davis,RUNS SMALL,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKX6NQB1PJD91/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZJ848P2,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 29, 2020",Size: X-LargeColor: Purple,Verified Purchase,"I am 5"" 6"" 150 lbs  (36 D Chest) and usually wear a medium or large depending on the style of shirt. I bought an XL because I read the reviews posted here. I am glad I did. I am concerned that after washing it will be too small so will only hang dry. Sleeve length  is great since I ordered the larger size. Fabric is soft/smooth cotton. Seems to be very good quality and well sewn. I purchased the hooded lavender style.",

My tunic measures 30.5 inches long in the back and the material is not too thin.",
