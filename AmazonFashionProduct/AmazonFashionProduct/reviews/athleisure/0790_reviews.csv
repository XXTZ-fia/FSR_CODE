Lindsey,"Simple, but I really like it!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PZJH3RB7MTJV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLFT55BW,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: Dark PinkSize: X-Large,,"This is a pretty basic top, but I'm finding it harder & harder to find a comfy/everyday/moderately oversized shirt that I actually like- but I'm happy to say I've got one here. It's lightweight & breathable, and definitely roomy, but with a more feminine cut so you don't feel like a slob wearing it out. It looks good partially tucked or not tucked at all. The rolled sleeves stay in place nicely after washing too, and I didn't notice any significant shrinkage. The color also looks exactly the same in person as it does online, I love that it's a neutral, muted tone but I still get a pop of color. But what I love most about it is that fact that it's priced at $9.99! I didn't think such a reasonable price existed anymore!",
Crazy Elwin,Nice oversized shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36VEXCK37X88S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLFT55BW,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Color: Dark PinkSize: X-Large,,"For the price, this is really a nice comfortable shirt.  Sister was impressed with what i got her for Christmas as she loves this type of shirt.  The dark pink was between lavender and pink, well that's what she said.  She liked it and said it's real comfortable.  The size was big on her, but that was the intention anyway.After the first wash, shirt hasn't fallen apart and she seems to be wearing it a lot since",

If you want something extra-casual, and non-form fitting that you probably see yourself not leaving the house with, then this is it.-  Ordered Wine Red, and it is more like Bland Peach.-  The material is medium thickness, so if you want something that you can sweat in, this is it.My wife is 5'4"", and 116 lbs.  As a 34C, she wears a common Medium.  We ordered Medium, and it is giant on her.  That said, if you are a larger American/European woman, then I believe that Medium might be more appropriate for you.  I would be afraid to see what Large looks like, tbh.The material is nice, and soft, and my wife says that she is going to put it to use, perhaps using it as a shorter dress, with a longer skirt.  I didn't include a picture because to me it kind of looks like pajamas.",

I would have sized down if I knew the top was this big. It pretty much swallows me. The arm holes are huge. The shirt itself is a nice lightweight material that is stretchy. It's just too big. It washed well on cold and I hung it to dry with no problems.,

I got the XX-large, and it fits like a slightly larger X-Large. The shoulder seams are a little too high up on the shoulder, and while the length of the tshirt is good, it still clings in all the wrong spots. Plus the color is more pale berry than what is shown on the screen. The neck is a little too high and the thickness of the fabric is 1/2 ply. It's good to have for the summer or if you're going to the beach. It'll dry instantly.",

Really glad I did, because even the size down is still REALLY big.  The fabric is a little on the thin side, which is nice for workout clothes. You don't want something heavy for that.  It is a tiny bit stretchy, but since it's oversized, not sure why I need that.  I just threw it on right out of the package, but still like the look and feel.  I wish I had ordered two sizes down, but this is still nice enough to keep.",

Unfortunately, the fit wasn’t for me. The sleeves fell past my elbows, making the rolled cuffs feel heavy, and the crew neck sat too high, causing me to constantly adjust it. To be fair, I sized up to an XL instead of my usual large, which may have contributed to the fit issues. Still, it just didn’t feel as comfortable as I had hoped, and I’m unlikely to reach for it often.",
