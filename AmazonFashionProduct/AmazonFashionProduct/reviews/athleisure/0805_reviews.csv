Amazon Customer,Review of 4 brands!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R86KCXOOGUXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9SK5G5Q,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 1, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: True Navy,Verified Purchase,"***HeyNuts***: love it!!! only dislike was the shorter length, it’s as pictured just not as flattering on me! Everything else was great! Would recommend. The strappy back was also my favorite and super flattering and comfortable!  POSHDIVA: this was good but overall my least favorite. so soft and well made, but too high in the armpits and weirdly small circular boob pads (probably fine if you remove them). More of a regular tank top length which I do really like! Would keep if not for the armpits.  Sphinx cat: my favorite of all 4! Love the color and fit, perfect length and not too tight (I sized up to XL on all). Love the material and ribbed texture. non-bra part is definitely thinner but I prefer that for summer! Absolutely love the color too!  The gym people: great material and fit, just shorter than I want - totally a personal preference! Otherwise great buy and would recommend.",29
Teagan,Perfect length and fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RI1IPPRP3BCYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9SK5G5Q,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Denim Blue,Verified Purchase,I love these types of tops for working out or even wearing casually in the summer. The back straps are so cute and the color is just like the photo. It reaches a perfect length with high waisted shorts that it doesn’t show any stomach unless you raise your arms. The built in bra makes it very comfortable. It isn’t see through and has a bit compression. I don’t have much of a bust and am 5’4” ish. I got my regular size of size small and it fit perfectly. I would buy more of these in more colors. I have many other types of shirts like this and this one is probably my favorite.,

Picture is true to color. The only issue is the sizing is very inconsistent and the size chart is not accurate at all. I’m 5’7”, 34D, 150 lbs, 28in waist and I usually wear a small in tops. I didn’t want tight compression so ordered a medium. It was still very tight, created bulges under my arms and made me look completely flat chested, so I returned it and ordered a large and it fits perfectly. Length comes to my belly button which is great for high waisted bottoms at the gym. It’s a great top, just make sure you order at least one size up from what the chart recommends unless you like tight compression or have a smaller cup size.",32

I am 5ft 6 and the top rested at the top of my hips, showing off my belly button down. Not what I was looking for at all as it would end up riding up and needing adjustment often during an actual workout. If you aren’t bothered by a cropped fit, this top would be a great option as it has a built in bra and is otherwise comfortable. If you are like me and searching for coverage, this top is not for you.  Aside from the length of this top, it fits true to size and the built in bra provides the perfect amount of support.",7

It’s not a short crop so if you wear high waist shorts your tummy is completely covered. The material is very soft and stretchy and the built in bra is wonderful! It compresses enough to hold the girls in place for a workout but I don’t feel squeezed at all. It’s very comfortable for lounging or hitting the gym. If you have big tatas the built in bra might not be great for running but still great for weightlifting. I’m a D and I run in it comfortably but if they were much bigger I could see that being a problem. I highly recommend this tank..it would even make a great gift. Runs true to size.,2

That aside, this does have a really supportive built in bra for a b cup, not just little pads, but more support there too. However, the material is not very stretchy.

It is a crop top and rests about an inch above my belly button - don't be fooled by the models.  On my body, it didn't work because I am high waisted and have enough of a cut in that the tank top creeps up into my waist and becomes just a bra.  If it were a tad longer it might stay down in place on me.  Standing completely still it's very flattering though.  If you are trim and wear high waisted leggings you should try this.  Also, athletic 160 and 36C and a large fit well with a little extra room...I just don't like things super tight.  If you have a smaller bra size get the Medium.  If you have a slightly bigger bra size large will still work for you.",3

I absolutely love it, supports my boobs that have seen better days after breastfeeding 2 children, but also works as a top eliminating the need for more layers of clothes. I wear it to the gym and also under my FP dupe jumpsuits. No spilling out of the cups, feel comfortable running in it with the amount of support. Not too compressive but still gives the right amount of “containment.” The straps are also comfortable and not too tight or too lose. Absolutely perfect.",

Duchessoftheturnerhouse,So soft and cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REQ4ZALC9E3HK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9SK5G5Q,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 18, 2024",Size: LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,I love this top.

Caitlin S.,Comfy and decent fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10HC1KGZFJ5YP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9SK5G5Q,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 16, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Dazzling Blue,Verified Purchase,"I'm a 5'8"" 165lbs and wear a 36D and bought the large as was recommended by the size chart. It's supportively snug in the chest but loose around the waist, which I like, but it was not really evident in the pictures that it has a looser fit around the waist. If you have a big chest or a small waist relative to your body size, this might not be the fit for you.",11
