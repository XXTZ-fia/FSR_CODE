Pull the shorts to the side to pee through the leg and get over it. It’s tight fitting and acts as a body suit. The conjunction of the bra and under garment work together to keep you tucked in and join at a sports bra line under the boob. I removed the pads although they did help to push up but I tossed them and replaced them with cakes I wasn’t looking for that I was going for casual and comfy in the summer heat. They did help the girls though but again wasn’t going for that. Not a real fan of the aesthetics of the adjustable back straps and that’s my only complaint. Looks kinda like you crossed the two straps yourself from the back. Was hoping for a brighter dark teal and it came as navy which matched my eyes and worked out I guess. Would highly recommend aside from the minor personal opinions! High quality likely not an easily snagged material and I am pretty rough with clothing. Hopefully they come out with other colors and improve the cross in the back!",2
