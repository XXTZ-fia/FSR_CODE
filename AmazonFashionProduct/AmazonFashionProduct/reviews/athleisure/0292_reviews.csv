Never really do. I’m 5’9, 154 lbs and athletically built. I have long legs so I have to get everything in tall and most of the time the tall still isn’t enough. I ordered a medium, which I normally wear in the 36 inseam and god lord they are long but it’s amazing. The fabric is soooooo soft. Pockets are nice and comfy. The waste has a stretchy band to it which is nice but it’s also has drawstrings. I love these pants. I’ve haven't found something so comfy, long enough and not so damn pricy in a long time and these are them. I got them in black.",7

The fabric is the perfect mix of dress up or down. They can be worn to work, or around the house. If you live around dirt roads and happen to get dirt on them getting in and out of your car, they clean up pretty easily.  I should’ve ordered the 34” because I wear a 36” in everything else and those usually fit just right, but the 36” is more like a 38”, so I’ll be purchasing a 34” from here on.  Overall, buy the pants. Quality is great. Pockets are actual pockets, color is good, they feel great, all the things!",3

I’m considered short, but my inseam is 31” - 32”. So, when I saw these that stated the inseam was 32” long, I decided to try a pair. I viewed the provided size chart and ordered a small. The color I received is accurate to what’s shown in the listing and the size is true to size. The multi-stitched waistband has quite a bit of stretch, and for those with a small waist, there is a drawstring to help cinch the waist in. The side-seam pockets are great, and large enough to fit my iPhone 12 Pro in easily. The fabric is a soft, stretchy knit that’s very common to leggings and some jogger pants, and it feels very comfortable against the skin. The quality is good with neat and even topstitching, finished interior seams and attention to detail throughout the pants. Unfortunate for me, the pants are too long. In order to wear these, I will have to cut and hem them. In pulling a tape measure out these pants have an inseam of 32.5” and a front rise of 12”. I really wanted to like these pants, so I could get some additional colors. But, with them being so long, I will have to pass and leave these for the tall ladies with a longer rise and inseam.  For reference, my measurements are: Height - 5’4” Bust - 35” Waist - 30” Front rise - 9.25” Arm length - 22.5” Shoulder width - 15” Weight - 120# Inseam - 31”",

These pants were extra long even for me. I am going to have to hem them.  I would recommend being careful  getting the extra long unless you are 6 foot 5. The fabric is good, the construction is solid.",
Zara Siddiqui,The tall is TALL,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32YPPQMI4F7CI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQ2N5RZH,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 20, 2023","Fit Type: 34"" Inseam (Tall)Size: MediumColor: Dark Grey",,"So I was a little confused by the sizing labels with 34 as tall and 32 as long. I went ahead and got my regular size and picked the 34 inseam thinking it would turn out to be a high-waisted look. These turned out to be freakishly long hahaha. I would probably recommend the 34 inseam for medium if you are over 6 ft tall or have very long legs. I am 5'7"" and these ended up about a good 4-5 inches past the bottom of my foot. I will definitely have to hem these and I'm still not sure what the difference between tall and long is here. As for the pants themselves, they are made of a very lightweight and breathable material. They are stretchy and stay cool to the touch too. I think these would be great looser fitting pants for working out or casual wear during the summer time. They seem to be weel stitched and I didn't notice any holes or loose threads. Great pants but will have to adjust to the proper length.",
Teresa,"Comfortable pants, but not sweat pants!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2M15Q7JDJMI7C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQ2N5RZH,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 16, 2023","Fit Type: 32"" Inseam (Long)Size: MediumColor: Black",,"These pants came with minimal packaging (pants were sent in a plain ziploc bag with address card on the front), which is fine with me.  They are nice soft pants, but are definitely not 'sweatpants.'  They are more like a nice thin pair of nylon/spandex yoga pants.  The pant legs are wider, which I like, and the pants have pockets on both sides to hold keys and/or phone.  I think that they run a bit on the large side, I wear an 8 - 10 in women's pants and ordered the medium and although they fit, they are definitely on the looser side.  I think at this price point, you could find better yoga pants online.",
