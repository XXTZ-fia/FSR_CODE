While it says tummy control waist, I do not notice any kind of tummy control at all with these leggings. But that is fine for me, as that wasn't a feature I cared about anyway. - The pockets are mainly why I purchased these leggings. Admittedly, I did not pay a lot of attention to the photo showing the pocket placement on these leggings. All other leggings I have purchased with pockets have all had the same placement, on the side of the leg. So when I received these and found the pocket to be more on the front like regular pants I was surprised. That is my fault. These pockets are made inside of the pants with extra fabric, while the side leg pockets on other leggings I have put the pouch outside of the legging so there is no extra fabric inside. If I am explaining that correctly. So I am adjusting the fabric often as it gets bunched. The pocket is somewhat deep. It almost covers my iphone 14 plus. Walking a lot, or bending over, or other movement makes the phone move up in the pocket and at times fall out. This does not happen with the other legging pockets on the side of the leg. My entire phone fits in those and does not move when I am gardening or anything else. - I also found that I had to pull the leggings up more so they settled correctly on my waist and in the crotch area. So doing this made the leggings higher up on my leg than I wanted, unlike the photo shows. I am only 5'4"" and my legs are not very long. So this was a little disappointing as well. - However, overall, I am happy enough with the purchase to not return them. The colors are very nice, the size is perfect, they are so soft, and the waist does not hurt with all day wear. If my little quirks don't bother you, then I would recommend them.",6

That’s great! They fit my 215 lb body size 16-18 and fit around my belly perfectly!! They are super soft and the pockets are pretty deep but ON THE INSIDE!!! It makes them bunch up and look ridiculous The cons are that they are not really think but they are by no means transparent. If they have spandex in them it’s not what’s most in them. I say that because they are so soft and buttery and may get picked easily if you have a pet with claws.  When I sit they bunch a little bit around the top where the pockets are. Loose like. I don’t care for that. They don’t hold you in with mulch support at all but are good for everyday around the house or casual running around. I won’t buy more. When I really like a product and know it’s gonna last I will buy more. Not these.  PS…. Cat hair DOES stick to these like crazy.  And the pocket area stretches out and bunches up and looks absolutely horrible. These are stupid ugly and I can’t send them back because the hubby threw away the packaging.,
