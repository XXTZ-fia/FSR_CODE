Amazon Customer,"Great quality, runs a bit small",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZQE34815AFE5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNVVM7CL,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 16, 2020",Size: SmallColor: 01d Dotted Pattern - Sky Blue,Verified Purchase,I'm very petite and have a hard time finding legging that actually fit and aren't too big. I am a true XS sometimes even an XXS. But these fit perfectly!! So I'd say the run a bit small. Very comfortable. Definitely squat proof. The waist band on the leggings is thicker then the rest of the leggings so it really sucks in your core. Waist band is tight but the rest is very stretchy and comfortable! I'm short in the torse but the crop top length was perfect. Good quality material. Will be purchasing other colors.,40

Su Rose,Extremely Embarrassing - Fabric Split Mid Squat,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MMIOAC0NCXW1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNVVM7CL,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 11, 2021",Size: LargeColor: 01d Dotted Pattern - Sky Blue,Verified Purchase,"Pants Split Mid Squat - Defective pair - A story  I bought the burgundy 2 piece and loved the way fit, I got so many compliments and felt so sexy ! Squats were a breeze I felt so good about it that I bought the baby blue set to add to my collection too!  I was really excited to take these out the package and wear them to the gym - it was leg and glute day and because of my history with the burgundy pair I felt comfortable and confident diving straight into my workout and hitting some deep squats and cardio !  Mid squat I heard the most dreadful noise “a tear” I immediately ran to the bathroom mirror to see the damage and noticed the fabric split straight down the crack! And you could clearly see my black seamless panties showing through the split, I was so embarrassed!  I didn’t have a sweater to cover the split so I had to walk out the gym with a tear  Purchasing this set is risky because you may get a good pair and you may not! If you do get a bad pair be ready to walk around with your panties showing or like the pictures above at any moment.  Gym shark is expensive but I’ve never received a defective pair of clothing from them  Purchasing through Amazon is a gamble - my advice hmmm maybe just don’t waste your money or pride or use the law of attraction to attract a non defective pair of clothing.",6

This material is absolutely comfortable and feels durable. Also it has belly control which means if you have a little pudge you will not be able to tell in these. The material is stretchy so you really can order your exact size. I bought 3 different colors and I am very happy. Toodles,4

I had to intentionally shrink it in the dryer to get it to fit properly, even though other reviewers of my same height and weight range got the same size (5’4” 155lbs, size L) and theirs was a better fit for them. The big thing I dislike about this set is the bottoms, they are thick and comfortable but they bunch or crepe around the crotch area so I prefer to wear them with other leggings and not the ones that came in this set. It could possibly be because I got too big of a size, but I have washed and dried them to shrink them and this is still the case. The top is great though!",
Gabriella f.,Best out of all selections,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26YVK4N2Q7XJC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNVVM7CL,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 2, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"everyone get the black set! I got the long sleeve top with the pants. I recently purchased the pink short sleeve, set with what were supposed to be the same leggings as the black ones.  But it turns out that the black pants have better tummy control, thicker material, and it’s more absorbent when I have high intensity workouts.  The others aren’t bad from my experience, they are just thinner material and lower quality.",2
Lisa,Love it! So comfy and form fitting,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CK1S7058AGUL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNVVM7CL,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 3, 2021",,Verified Purchase,So I was litte nervous to try this on when it arrived because holding it up it looked absolutely tiny!  But once I started putting it on it stretched out massively but somehow also staying very fitted to my body. Its very comfortable and breathable fabric. It also feels durable like it will last a while so here's hoping 🤞  Overall I love it and can't wait to test it out. The only slight downside is that the chest area isn't padded and it doesn't keep me fitted in that area so I may need to add a sports bra underneath for some extra support,

It is really flattering, not sheer at all, and true to size and picture! It doesn't feel like it'll fall down if I run. I do wish that it shaped my butt more, but what can you do. I gave it 3 stars though because for some reason, both pieces came in the bag inside out and the sleeves were switched? The left sleeve had the thumb hole for my right hand and vice-versa. Pretty frustrating but overall great product!",
