Hannah Montag,The perfect casual cute closet staple!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C1UKEYK3WWWJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C69HY6XP,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 21, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Rust,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love this romper dress!! It is so incredibly comfortable and cute! I have gotten so many compliments when I wear it out! It is great quality material and is so universal that it can be worn for a variety of events! You can dress it up or wear it casually and be active in it! It has large/deep pockets that are great for keys/small wallets. I bought a cropped white tank to go underneath of it which completed the look! There is a full-body romper with shorts that is fitted, but not too tight or restricting. It is the perfect length and it's straps are not uncomfortable at all! The color is so perfect and looks exactly like the picture! I would buy this again and again!!",2
Amazon Customer,Surprisingly flattering,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9NN3DWW86F20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C69HY6XP,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 22, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Hot Pink,Verified Purchase,"I have been wanting one of these dresses for awhile and had looked at several other vendors before settling on this one. I went with Anrabess based on the size chart, adjustable straps, and reviews. I got a large and am glad. It fits rather well and is quite comfortable. I have a smaller bust with big ribs, so I have to tighten the straps all the way. I have to undo them when I need to use the bathroom.  I am 5’0 and the dress hits mid-kneecap. I wear roughly a 12/14 in womens and 13/15 in juniors pants with a flat butt. Tops are anywhere from Large to 1x depending on brand. I have a C-section belly with a mind of its own. The last time I was measured for a bra (VS about 2018) I was a 40C. The large fits me really well. It doesn’t cling to my midsection. The bodysuit underneath is fitted but far from “too tight”. It doesn’t dig, the shorts don’t ride up. Don’t expect it to fit like shapewear. I’m not super fond of the design of the pockets, it reminds me of Pippi Longstocking. However I am thankful to have pockets. This one did not have the bra inserts in the top like other dresses I viewed. It’s fine with a sports bra underneath. I have never been a dress person but wanted something fun and different but still comfy for summer. It’s 97F as of about 15 minutes ago and I don’t feel overheated. I did worry about that given it’s two layers technically but it feels nice. I have worn it for a few hours today while running errands and the sweat marks are minimal. I got this as a Mother’s Day gift and will be getting more for summer. I could sleep in this if I wanted because it’s that comfy.  *excuse the yucky mirror in my pics. I was in the bathroom in the storage building.",112
Mallory,Runs big!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1N84C0FGOYXZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C69HY6XP,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 2, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Coffee,Verified Purchase,"Bought this as an easy outfit to run errands in while carrying around babies / dogs and it's super cute and comfy!

Perfect for any age! I ordered the light pink!  First, after reading the reviews I decided to order the small!  I am 5'4 125lbs. Small, petite shape.  I could have maybe ordered the XS.  The only reason I may want the smaller size is so the shorts, the body shorts underneath would fit a bit more snug, more slimming!  It is comfortable!  Great quality fabric! Doesn't look cheap!  The length is just above the knees with adjustable straps so it is appropriate for any occasion, work, running errands, summer night out, picking kids up from school!  And the pockets, you can't go wrong with this item!  This is a must have in your summer wardrobe!  Buy one and you will want to buy a second one!  I am already looking at the color options!",8
JB_Mama,Cute but not for me,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QG65NT2ARJ1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C69HY6XP,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 1, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Navy Blue,Verified Purchase,"I think most normal people who aren’t overly critical of their body would love this. Easy to throw on and super comfy!  I would kill to find this dress without the built in body suit! I would need to wear a tank under it to feel comfortable but by then there would be a bra, tank top, built in body suit and then dress. Far too many layers for me. I love the idea of this but I pee way too much to have to take it off eveytime, the straps don’t seem quite strong enough to constantly be pulled and tugged eveytime you have to take it down. It’s super cute but if you need more coverage around your under arms/chest (my major insecurity areas) this may not be for you as it hangs relatively low around the arms.",37
Sarah Pineres,Perfect casual dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MJABWD7E3E97/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C69HY6XP,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 24, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Gray Blue,Verified Purchase,"So easy to throw on and run errands, brunch, walk around town. Can easily be dressed up a bit with a jean jacket for brunch with friends. The color is beautiful and the dress is excellent quality. This brand makes good quality clothes!! I like to wear an undershirt with build in bra, so I don’t have to mess with a strapless. The built in romper provides amazing coverage at the arms, so a bra would be totally hidden. So much better than having to pay for the brand name, and honestly, I like this one more! Such an amazing value. The length is great and not mini at all. The under romper is stretchy, so it’s bump friendly too!",5
Leigh Anne D,Great comfy dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IPYG50ECZAQV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C69HY6XP,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 26, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Light Purple,Verified Purchase,"I ordered 2 colors and came back for more. This is the perfect casual dress for basically every summer activity. It's so comfortable and cute I know I will be wanting to wear these dresses all the time. It is pretty easy to get in and out of. It does help to loosen the straps all the way before you try to take the dress off or pull it on.  I found that if you don't, the underarm area can tend to get stretched out looking.  The romper shorts are a good length. They want to ride up on me a bit, but most shorts do so that's not a major issue. I also need to have a nice looking sports bra on underneath because much of my bra is still exposed. Like even if I was wearing a strapless bra, it would still be visible under the arms. I don't mind the look with the sports bra, and it gives you more options on color combos with the dress. The dresses have washed well so far. Great buy, for me!",10
Deborah W.,Simple and cute.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHUCV4FJGVWBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C69HY6XP,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 31, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Deep Gray,Verified Purchase,I would have given it 5 stars but the straps could be a little softer/wider and it's a bit of work if you have to use the restroom... However... I am planning on buying 1 more in another color :) Fit wise - I am a formerly athletic/active woman wearing a 38/ F. Most my weight is muscle and chest but I have some age weight on me now as well. Knowing these things hopefully helps visualize the fit. The XL fits me snug but comfy - other than the straps that dig a bit into my shoulders. It probably wasn't made for carrying these overgrown monsters.. so I wouldn't judge it by that 🤣,

I think the material feels nice, but my only complaint is that I wish the length was shorter bc I’m short. I think it’s about 1-2 inches too long for me. I may have it altered. The underneath bodysuit has zero compression to it so it won’t help if you have an apron belly like I do. However the overlaying dress doesn’t seem the cling to my belly thank goodness. Also if you have a big bottom it will make it stand out. Either way, I think I will keep it regardless. I always have a hard time with rompers because of my bigger backside and I think this dress I can make work, as if I sized up to an XL, I think it would be too big up top. Definitely needs a longer sports bra or tank top underneath. Also I was hoping the material would be a little thinner for summer, bc it feels like a thick cotton.",3

The color is true to the picture. Love this for a stay at home/run errands outfit.  I like the loose, drapey fit, but the arm holes are just a bit too loose for me. Wish it came in an XS.  The other thing is, once you take it off, its like a puzzle to get it back in the right configuration to put it away!  It gets all tangled up because of the insdie body suit versus the outside dress that are attached!  Love it though and would buy it again, maybe with another vendor that sells the XS so the arm holes aren't super loose.",

I wore the 2xl and I needed to wear my sports bra or a tank for chest coverage, otherwise it wouldn't have been enough for me. Super comfy. The shorts inside the jumper were just a little bit shorter than I would pick on my own, but it worked out. I was really happy with the skirt length. And the pockets! I saw so many of these on people walking around the park. They are really easy to wear. My teenage daughter got a matching one and she loves hers too.",6

Maybe they are not sewn all the same. I returned for a small. I am 5’2 , 36A, 27 waist , 38 hips. The small fit but I would rather the inside be loose because there is not much airflow. The liner is the same material as the outside of it. It’s very soft I have the strap Mid way . Great length for myself. It would be more comfortable with wearing a cami or bathing suit underneath since it does have a little bit of a gap . The mint green is a very pale soft color . Just like it’s shown just the right amount of paleness. This is great for a cooler summer day or night. I can’t imagine playing tennis in this on a hot day. 🥵",27
