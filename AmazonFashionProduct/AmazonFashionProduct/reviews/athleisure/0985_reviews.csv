For reference, I'm 5'6"" and about 180 lbs, hourglass shape.I would have given this product a 4-star rating but there was an issue with one of the shirts.  The gray shirt in the set was a different size (2XL) than the other shirts.  I did not notice until I had already worn the teal and pink shirts and washed them so I couldn't return the pack.  I reordered the shirts in the same color set hoping to swap out the mis-sized shirt and do a return but once again the gray shirt was a 2XL.
