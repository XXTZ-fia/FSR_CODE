However, I ended up returning them because the tan color was see-through on me. I'd be interested in trying a different color since they fit true to size.",

Rudeney,Odd fabric but comfrotable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RY6U5XGFZHOKP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQ4GWL6K,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 16, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Army Green,,"I ordered these for my wife.  Based on the size chart, I had to get a large, even though she normally wears a small.  I probably could have gone with a medium since these are baggy.  There are a few odd things about these pants.  First is that the drawstring is fake!  It's just sewn on for looks, which is odd.  The waist uses elastic.  The other odd thing is the fabric.  Although these pants are 100% polyester, they have a look and feel of linen - wrinkles and all.  In fact, they are a bit rough like linen that has been well-starched.  Those two oddities are the reason for my 4 out of 5 star rating.  Otherwise, these are nice pants and seem well-made.  I do recommend them as they are a good value.",
Hillseeker,Comfortable but lack structural finesse,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UOGFT9Z83MBD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQ4GWL6K,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 3, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Army Green,,"Very comfortable and lightweight. Gonna be living in these when the weather heats up. While I’m not a fan of polyester fabric, I figured I’d give these a try. They feel like a linen-mimic, wrinkles and all, which is odd because polyester is usually non-wrinkle. While they haven’t been too static-prone, they do get a bit clingy after a few hours (I live in a normally dry climate, but it’s been humid lately). I sized up to an L for comfort (usually between an American size S and M); measurement-wise, these are true to advertised size. I picked a large because the listing says these have a drawstring waistband; however, the drawstring is not functional—it’s just a tie sewn onto the front. The waistband and leg cuffs are elastic, though, and are comfortable enough to slip on-and-off. The hip and leg pockets have raw edges on the inside, so I’m not sure how well they will hold up in the long term. Additionally, they aren’t very deep (eg. the hip pocket holds my phone, but not for long). The leg pockets don’t have any closures to keep them shut, so they will mostly be decorative; and while they have what looks like a central pleat that would allow the pocket to expand, it’s actually sewn shut and will not expand. Overall these lose two points from me due to the raw/unfinished seams inside the pockets, the fake drawstring, and the static-y fabric. Otherwise, they're nice for lounging and light hiking.",2
