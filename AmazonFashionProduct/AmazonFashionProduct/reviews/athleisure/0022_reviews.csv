Dreamscometrue,"Pretty wonderful, have two pair…",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R303TPPDGCGVGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHPMYGCG,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 20, 2023",Color: Royal BlueSize: Medium Petite,Verified Purchase,"Am 5’6, 28” inseam 130ish lbs - bought the wide leg in white as a med 30” inseam as for some reason i though they might run short - they don’t, that’s fine - they are way more flattering tight rolled giving them a jogger/harem look so I’ll stuck with them. Also, the medium is loose enough on me that while i do have to pay some attention to underwear color, they are not see thru and don’t show any cellulite - a tighter fit might show more details there, but they are more opaque than many white pants I’ve tried while not being too thick for cooler summer weather (over about 85°F, no humidity & these are too thick for me.) Color is ever so slightly cream, almost a winter white - could pass as either white or winter white if that matters to you.  Second pair is another wide leg in “royal blue” M, 28” inseam and they *almost* touch the floor when I’m barefoot, the ideal break on flatter shoes IMHO. The color is a match to the photo, a navy blue - the pants are *not the brighter blue I associate with royal blue* at all, but I was willing to gamble, it’s a very nice true shade of navy, not too green, purple or grey in undertone. The darker color is slightly more flattering than the white, but not much.  If thigh slenderizing is high priority for you these wide leg ones are not your pants…they aren’t terribly unflattering, but they do me the least favors out of every pair of bottoms I own, old pajamas included, hence 4 instead of 5 stars.  The best part is they are wildly comfy and present much dressier than many of their equivalents in comfort! Easily yoga pants or even sleep wear. The medium loosely skims my frame without looking sloppy-baggy; would fit a small I’m sure, but I like wide leg pants to fit on the looser end. Front pockets are deep enough to for my phone with room left over. The exposed stitching of the flat seams make them extra comfortable, but knocks them out of being the true dress pants they could pass for with invisible stitching - they could easily pass as dressy enough for a great many occasions where jeans are a no-go for but aren’t up to par if you’re expected to be much dressier than business casual, purely because of the LEG seams, IMHO. (Am great with that and wish the waist seams were also flat, they’d be phenomenally comfy then - but if these folks offered an additional variety of these pants and sold them as the dressy version with all invisible stitching and leg seams in a more flattering position, these could easily be cocktail attire and definitely pass in any business setting.)",96
Viviannuchis,Comfortable and Flattering Yoga Pants!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C5Z4EG65QNBF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHPMYGCG,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 26, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Medium Tall,Verified Purchase,"These wide-leg yoga pants are a dream! The fabric is incredibly soft and lightweight, making them perfect for yoga, lounging, or even running errands. The wide-leg design gives me plenty of freedom to move, and they’re so flattering on any body type. I ordered a size M, and while they fit well, I think a size S would have been a better fit for me. The waistband is stretchy but stays in place without digging in, which is a huge plus during workouts. They’re stylish enough to wear outside the house, and I’ve already gotten so many compliments on them. Highly recommend these if you’re looking for a mix of comfort and style!",12

Trevor Gettmann,"Pros: look dressy. CON: length off, no compression.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RECRJ2PMVA32Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHPMYGCG,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 10, 2024",Color: Deep GreySize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I am 5’4 and 140 pounds. I ordered this in black, grey and beige/khaki tan. I started with the black size medium short/petite but the length was too short even with flats. The wide leg doesn’t look right unless it’s almost touching the heel of your shoes. Next I ordered the medium (not short or tall just medium) in the grey & tan. I didn’t like the color of the lighter pair, the pockets were sewed differently and they were shorter inside and the fit in the crotch wasn’t the same as the grey. I also observed that the grey didn’t look as dressy as the black. Basic wide leg yoga pants. Trying on clothes from the closet I paired black pants with 3 different dress tops & a pashmina, both a Jean & leather jacket. All ok with flats albeit an inch short. But with boot, nope. boots (The pockets really help make them look more like regular pants, but only in the black. Not so much in the lighter colors.  Cons: 1. sizing is off. For 5’4 and a 29 length the petite length should be at least 1.5 inches longer.  2. no compression or tummy control. Absolutely zero—actually made my tummy a little more pronounced.  3. pucker at the pockets due to their placement. I’d go down to a small or xs but the pockets stick out already in a medium  4. price had already jumped from $25 to $35 in a week.  5. These are not worth $35 in my opinion being that they do nothing for tummy control. But for comfort, material and thickness these are 4 star. Just don’t expect these to replace shapewear. It won’t. If they go on sale again I will purchase another pair in maybe the darker blue but I will definitely get the Small Tall and see if that helps. Otherwise I’ll stick with the medium I’ve got. I NEVER wear heels and have short legs (my Jean size is a Lee size 8 short petite.) which means that the petite is ever too short for saddles and flat Dansko fur lined boots. The sandles looked a little better being just a cork type sole like a Birkenstock but less money. But I find them very comfortable, my husband thinks they are sexy and they are perfect for a long event (wedding/bsby shower/work) where your wanting to look dressed up without loosing comfort. I had a pair of compression tights on under these and they came off after 2 hours and I honestly felt like I was wearing pj bottoms. They haven’t wrinkled in the slightest, and I don’t typically “fold” or hand my pants after wearing. These were picked up after a week folded in half or in a ball on the floor and worn to church. They DO NOT NEED IRONED! Because they have some elastic I’d still recommend line drying and washing inside out in cold water in a mesh laundry bag. Elastic breaks down over time and I hang mine in the shower to dry in the winter when I don’t want to use the clothes line. Amazon sells these really cool hanger clips and I hang all my underwear and socks and everything else in the shower to dry.  Also, dirt wipes off easily and dog hair doesn’t stick to these.",121

They're perfect for travel too - again, I'm not one to wear lounge clothes on flights because I think it's in poor taste to wear like sweatpants at the airport, but these look so elevated, they could just be trousers.

Of course, in my day they were called bell bottoms.  lol  Anyway, these are the most comfortable pants I have and the most flattering as I'm a ""full-figured"" woman.  It's hard to find pants that look good on me. but these do.  I highly recommend them.",2
Cher T,Very nice but didn’t work for me,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OCHI66427QHD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHPMYGCG,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 10, 2024",Color: Grey SageSize: Small Petite,Verified Purchase,These pants are really well made and very comfortable. But a couple issues for me were that the inseam was too long (I’m 5 ft. and bought the small) and the material was a little more thin than I wanted which made “ripples” in the skin too visible.,2
Wilson Customer,Careful which fabric/color/pattern you choose!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CHPOQDPR784Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHPMYGCG,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 7, 2024",Color: Heather GreySize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I own these yoga pants in 4 pair of capri length and 1 regular length. For the most part, I LOVE them! That said, I just returned a regular length pair in heather gray--the fabric was totally different than all the other pairs I own--stiff, almost a plasticy texture & smelly. The waist, when compared to the others, was considerably smaller. Also, I own them in the dark coffee (capri length). Fabric is fine but the color is just plain ugly. I kept them anyway they're so comfortable. Clearly, I'm a fan, but these are not inexpensive yoga pants and buyers should be aware that ""results vary.""",5
