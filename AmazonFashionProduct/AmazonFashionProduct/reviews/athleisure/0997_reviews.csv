Meredith Pollack,I wish I could give it star on style and fit alone....,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REH2NTEFGBSJ2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4TBD5HF,"3.0 "," the United States "," February 2, 2025",Color: YellowSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"I really love this sports bra.  It is comfy and has cool straps that with the right tank show off some fun style.  My only thumbs down is that the bright yellow color has faded with time.  I wish it still was the original color...because with it fading it doesn't have that same layering style pizzaz.  The construction is good and the material has held up to a long stretch of use - but the fading...sad face emoji.  If I feel like getting another one, I might, but I was hoping that I'd not know there is a decline in the vibrant effect over time.  And, yes, I washed it according to the tag.",

The fit is spot on and the support is light as expected. The only issues I have is the stupid padding shifts, folds, and is annoying when washed. The pads are also weirdly shaped like a shoulder pad from the 80s. The only reason I haven’t just pulled them out is because they seem to be nipple shields, but at this point I might just take my chances. The straps are thin and dig into my shoulders, but it’s kind of expected since I see it as more of a yoga bra than something that requires support. I wash it in the dryer and air dry it. I cycle through lots of sports bras because I work out daily and the running girl bras hold up well. They are my favorite brand right now.
