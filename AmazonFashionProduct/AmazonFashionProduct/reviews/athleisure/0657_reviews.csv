Love that it has hoodie style pockets in front!  I ordered 2 in different colors.  Very nice quality.  Fit as expected.  No issues with the zipper.  The material is super soft and nice thickness for cooler days.  Originally bought the light grey and cream color.  The cream color had a slight sewing flaw near the zipper.  It also had a yellow tint to it and not a true cream color.  I returned that one and bought the brown instead.  Love these! No pilling so far.  Only washed once.,16

To get a proper fit in the arms I would have to order a 2x but then the body would be way too big. I wanted to love it so bad but just couldn’t do it. I wish it had regular shoulders. The purple was lovely. Felt like great quality for the price.,9

It is a nice thickness. I’m wearing it straight out of the package so when the wrinkles are gone, I think it would be really cute with leggings or tighter pants. However the reason I am returning it is because the color is totally different than the listing I ordered the beige, which looks like an off-white or beige. What I got was a light yellow/peach type color which was awful.  I am giving up on this brand. I ordered it in a second color the desert palm since the first was returned and it is not the greenish khaki brown It looks in the photo. It is a coffee poop brown, and the ribbing is lighter than the sweat sweatshirt.  This company’s pictures do not match the actual color of the sweatshirt",7
