The black one arrived yesterday and I wore it today. I’m 5’ 6” and 220 pounds. I usually have to wear XXL because of my big boobs. But I looked at the size chart and opted to go with the XL. The suit fits perfectly. Even the length is perfect. I like the polished look of this sweatsuit. The material seems high quality and my dog’s white fur brushes right off,",8

It’s perfect material for fall or early winter. The material is light enough to put a layer underneath or to wear on its own. It is not a cotton jogger set. The material is a little more upscale making it look more polished. I think it can be worn with cute boots, sneakers or flats. The length & fit is perfect. I bought 2 colors in size L and both are cut the same. Pants are wide enough to be comfortable. The waist band is wide & the drawstrings are wide with finished ends & pants have deep pockets. The top has color coordinating zippers & looks boxy but when you put it on it’s sits just below the waist & lays nicely over the pants. The sleeves are a bit long on me but it’s still stylish. I say get a couple. You can’t go wrong for the price.",14
