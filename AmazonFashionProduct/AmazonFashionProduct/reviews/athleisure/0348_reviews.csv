I went with the size I knew I was going to feel comfortable in. I’m glad I did, because a size smaller may have fit, but it would have been too snug.

I love how they fit, they are super soft and so comfortable. I also like the pocket and how easy it is to access it, it’s really no fuss. I just think the fit is not for me, it works and I am going to be using them often, but they don’t flatter my body type. The front leg part kinda makes me look like I’m not using any shorts while I’m running as they ride up leaving me slightly self conscious and pulling the legs down repeatedly. I really don’t need that while trying to jog distance. I’m 5’4” 120 lbs and a small fit good.",5
Janie R,Not Happy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKU1BDM855BC5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BL6DVMC1,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 16, 2023",Size: MediumColor: 3 Pack: 06# Black & Navy Blue & Pink,Verified Purchase,"My daughter had bought these and loved them.  I tried hers on and decided they were comfortable and cute and ordered some for me.Mine arrived.  I tried on the first pair.....they fit nicely.  There were some loose strings, but I wasn't overly concerned.  I tried on the second pair....they fit nicely.  I tried on the third pair, the pink pair, the one I was most interested in because they are my favorite color.......the fit was snug and I could hear the threads breaking as I pulled the shorts up.  With broken threads, I knew they would continue to fall apart.  The fit wasn't comfortable either.  I checked the tags and all were the same size, so it made no sense that the one pair didn't fit the same.  It appeared they were not sewn properly, maybe.I asked Amazon if I could just exchange the pink pair, but was told no.  All three would have to be returned/exchaged.  So I returned all three, and I thought about ordering another set, but then decided not to.I would have given them ONE STAR......but knowing that my daughter's shorts were fine, I didn't feel it was right to give one star.  Maybe mine were just a fluke.....or maybe my daughter just got lucky.  Who knows.",33
