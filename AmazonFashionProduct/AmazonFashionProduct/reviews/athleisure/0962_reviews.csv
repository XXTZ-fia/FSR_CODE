I won't be returning them because I typically don't. If they remain stained I'll use them around the house. They might want to think of placing tissue between the pants to avoid this.",3

I definitely recommend going down a size from the usual wear as these are very thin.. thinner than normal leggings (so they look a little funny with any room) the stitching on one pair is falling apart after wearing them once only for a few hours. The pockets are HUGE which I absolutely love because I can never fit anything in my pockets but could legit fit a Stanley cup in these. They're very comfortable and they look okay.,

I also use these for cool weather runs.  They serve both purposes perfectly!  They are lightweight, breathable, and the waistband never budges, which is unprecedented for leggings.  They have a pants vibe but don't balloon out into harem pants like most joggers do. The ankles also never budge. The look is sleek without being tights.  The best quality, however is the length.  I tried jogger after jogger which left a huge gap at the ankle, or the ankles would ride up, causing a gap.  I am 5' 8 1/2"" and these are the perfect length - never too short.  The pockets are nice and flat and don't have that pocket material on the thigh adding bulk.  I have already purchased multiple packs and will never go back to tights!  Incredible value!",

The full waistband is high up but the elastic is only actually a small fraction of the full waistband.  She considered sizing up to XXL (and wish she did) as the elastic cuts right into her belly so she wears them mostly around her hips (here at home) in hopes that they eventually stretch out some.  We do love the colors and the fabric is nice & smooth though.Also, the pockets & phone shown are just like hers and it would be nice if the pockets were a bit bigger as she has an iPhone & it sticks out some making it easily droppable.",

They are incredibly comfortable, and the fit at the waist is just right. I often struggle with joggers that are too tight or too loose around the waist, but these have an elastic waistband with a drawstring that allows for easy adjustment. They sit comfortably without feeling restrictive.  The fact that they come in a three-pack is fantastic—I have multiple colors to choose from, so there's always a pair that goes with whatever I'm wearing. These joggers also have pockets, which is a huge plus! I can keep my phone, keys, or small essentials with me without having to carry a bag everywhere.  I wear them for just about everything. They're perfect for everyday wear, whether I'm running errands, lounging around the house, or hitting the gym. The fabric is soft and breathable, making them ideal for any activity. They hold up well in the wash, and the colors don't fade, which is great because I've been wearing them almost daily!  Overall, this three-pack of joggers is a fantastic buy. The comfort, fit, and versatility make them a must-have for anyone who wants stylish and functional joggers for multiple occasions. I highly recommend them!",12

A pack of 3 for $40(ish) puts each pair around $13. DEAL!!! I will say that I'm a bit concerned about how they'll wash because the darker colored pair packed next to the lighter colored pair in shipping actually rubbed off a little, darker onto lighter, see pic... I feel like that will wash off the peach colored pants BUT I'll definitely wash the darker pairs very carefully for a while, to keep them from ruining anything washed with them. I may try to update the review after I've had them for a while, but at this point I'll definitely buy more because the fit and feel and colors and price are all together awesome UPDATE 06/2024: These are still some of the best joggers I've had. I didn't notice any issues washing, they don't attract lint, the waist band is super comfy, no shrinkage anywhere. I love these for real. I'll keep the 4 stars just because of the color transfer onto the peach pair during shipping. That never came out. Hopefully they're packing them better now",27
