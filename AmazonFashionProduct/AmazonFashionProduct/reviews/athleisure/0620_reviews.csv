TJ,Great for mild temperatures,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UOHW9337R0AC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB59CC27,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this set for a one-year-old for Christmas. The fabric is thick enough to do very well in cooler temperatures above freezing, which is great for where I live. They seem to be comfortable. The colors are holding well after washing and the clothes did not shrink.  The size is great for a child between one and two years and she has room to grow into them. Hopefully they will still fit this time next year!",
