Kara,My favorite shorts,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BH0KX0I95AVL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9W2LL3T,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 29, 2024",Fit Type: 2.5'' High waistedSize: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I have no less than 10 pairs of these shorts and I recommend them to everyone because of how much I love them. I have a larger mid section with a bit of an apron belly and the wider 2.5” waist band is perfect. It not only provides a bit of compression (without being uncomfortable), but the waistband sits high enough to where it doesn’t give me love handles. They are both comfortable and super flattering and I love that it has a zipper pocket and that the pocket is big enough to put my phone in. I honestly wish they had two zipper pockets, but that’s literally my only “complaint”. I’m 5’7”, weigh around 215 and usually wear between a size 16-18 pants. I prefer the XXL size in these shorts because I feel they are a bit looser and a more comfortable fit, but the XL size fits just fine too.",15
April Horne,These are it!!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22E6C8CIH99CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9W2LL3T,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 3, 2024",Fit Type: 2.5'' High waistedSize: LargeColor: Red,Verified Purchase,"I purchased red and white and AM IN LOVE WITH THESE!!

There’s a pocket on the left side that has a zipper. Large enough to hold your phone, which came in handy when I got on the rides. Light weight. Vibrant colors. Comfy. Cute. GET IT.",13
Kindle Customer,Perfect orange,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YRSFHCI3ZT0N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9W2LL3T,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 7, 2024",Fit Type: 2.5'' High waistedSize: SmallColor: Neon Orange013,Verified Purchase,"I'm 4'11"" and 102lbs. I got a small and although they fit, I'm not 100% happy with them. I love the color, the zipper pockets, material (need to see if sweat will show), and that they are high wasted shorts. The backs are a little too long for my liking so I am going to keep trying them on in front of the mirror during my return time frame to see if I'll get over it or not. Since I'm short, they definitely look like puffy mom shorts on me. My fingertips sit right on the front length. They fit the same on the waist when sitting down; I'll need to sit in front of a mirror to see how they look when I sit though. Since the waist is so high and a bit thick, the waist is supportive. They will definitely remind you to sit up straight so that's a plus because slouching is not cute. They are true to size and to a T, so really be honest about your measurements when you order. If you are close going up a size and you know you fluctuate in weight, go up a size, sis.  My husband appreciated that my cheeks were not hanging out like the shorts I usually get at T@rget. They have a runner's liner too so I don't know what he's talking about. Their XL little girl's high waisted running shorts fit better if you want to try those before purchasing these. They are shorter by about 2 inches, same length all around, have lining, and are about ten bucks cheaper.  I'm hoping they are good tennis shorts to hold the balls in my pockets or to dress up cut for my son's games. Orange is one of his school colors and I always go all with my outfits to show support.",5

I usually wear a small, but ordered a medium based on other reviews, and they're still just a bit snug. The pocket is on the left, which is less than ideal for a right handed person. I'm a runner, but I would not wear these for a longer run.  With the pocket zipped, my phone fits and stays securely in the pocket while I'm running. However, because the pocket is on the outer layer of the shorts, my phone bounced around on my thigh while I was running. Not a show stopper, but certainly annoying. They also make my butt look flat. I'll keep looking for the perfect running shorts, these are not it for me.",

The fact that they have a liner in them that makes it so you're not fully ""feeling the breeze"" is great, and of course, it's always nice to have pockets, even if it's only one. The pocket isn't super small either. I initially bought the black pair and actually ended up coming back after a few months to get two more colors, grey and navy, all of which seem to be exactly as shown. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to, but I do put them in both the washer and dryer. They've been through the process multiple times on the regular washer setting and medium heat drying without issue so far. I just make sure to put them with lighter material clothing like t-shirts.",2

L.

Here's why these shorts have become a staple in my active wardrobe:  **Pros:** 1. **Comfortable High Waist:** The high-waisted design is both flattering and functional. It provides excellent support and coverage during workouts without feeling restrictive. Plus, it helps to smooth and shape the midsection for a flattering silhouette. 2. **Breathable Fabric:** The shorts are made from a lightweight and breathable fabric that keeps you cool and comfortable during even the most intense workouts. It wicks away moisture, allowing you to stay dry and focused on your activities. 3. **Convenient Pockets:** The addition of pockets is a game-changer. They're perfect for holding your phone, keys, or other essentials while you're on the go, eliminating the need for a separate bag or armband. 4. **Versatile Style:** These shorts are not only great for workouts but also stylish enough to wear for running errands or lounging at home. The sporty design and elastic waistband add a trendy touch to any casual outfit. 5. **Durable Construction:** Despite their lightweight feel, these shorts are surprisingly durable. The seams are well-constructed, and the fabric holds up well to repeated wear and washing without losing its shape or color. 6. **Wide Range of Sizes:** The shorts are available in a wide range of sizes, making it easy to find the perfect fit for your body type. Plus, the elastic waistband provides some flexibility in sizing for added comfort.  **Cons:** 1. **Sizing Accuracy:** Some users may find that the sizing runs slightly small, so it's worth checking the size chart before ordering to ensure the best fit. 2. **Limited Color Options:** While the available colors are stylish and versatile, a greater variety of color options would be appreciated to suit different preferences and styles.  **Overall:** The BMJL Women's Athletic Shorts are a fantastic choice for active women looking for comfortable and stylish workout gear. Their high-waisted design, breathable fabric, and convenient pockets make them a practical and fashionable choice for any activity. Whether you're hitting the gym, going for a run, or simply running errands, these shorts have you covered in both comfort and style. I highly recommend them to anyone in need of quality athletic wear.",29

They're super high waisted too, sitting at my belly button. Extremely breathable and didn't hold on to any sweat. The waist band is incredibly stretchy and comfy. I sized up to an XL but could've been fine with my normal size L (but wanted the extra length). The quality seems nice so far, they held up well while rock climbing and the built-in underwear add an extra layer of security. I would have preferred if the underlayer was a tad longer and more like built-in shorts, but I'm surprised how comfy the built-in underwear are. They don't ride up at all while walking!",

Soft violet color is great. These are a size small. They fit fine but are a bit short for me. I ordered the black ones in a size medium because I read in a few other reviews that the black ran smaller than the other colors, but I still found the medium in the black too short for me but also too wide at the bottom, which is why I'm not keeping them in the medium and am keeping these violet ones in small. They're completely comfortable and cute enough to keep, and the inner panty is not too tight even in the small. For reference I'm 5ft 6in, 123 lbs, rather long legged, usual size 4.

I carry my weight in my midsection so I hate things that are too tight in the tummy. It may not look like it in the photo because these really snatch your waist!  PROS: these look just like the photo. They are very lightweight, the length is perfect, and the lining is a major plus. It doesn’t ride up or feel restrictive.  CONS: the waistband isn’t my favorite. It looks good but it’s just slightly too tight for me and causes a tiny roll if I'm not sucking in. It feels uncomfortable after long wear. I ordered a medium in pink to see if that was better (and it was) but I didn’t like the length of the medium compared to the small. I’m keeping these and doing some stretching of the waistband in hopes of making them more comfy. I also have a few pounds I’m working on loosing so I think I’m going to love them in a few weeks lol.  That being said, I will be buying more colors because if I simply half tuck a tshirt, that fixes the chaffing so I can deal with the tightness (for now). It’s a win for me.",41

However, when I walked, the fabric bunched up in a boxy, awkward manner at my crotch - it made me wonder if I had put on the shorts backwards.

They are nice and flattering and I like the spanx/shorts underneath. Typically I never buy shorts with an inside liner or a built-in underwear type of thing, but these are supeeerrr comfy and u don’t have to worry about them riding up since the liner underneath keeps you covered! The outside of the shorts material is not very stretchy, even though the waistband and the liner shorts are.  My thighs have definitely grown in size since I bought this pair, so I don’t really wear them much anymore because the way it fits me with bigger thighs makes them pretty dang short… but that’s my thing! If I were to buy them right now, I would size up just so they wouldn’t be so short on my thighs. So keep that in mind if you have thicker thighs since the actual shorts material isn’t the most stretchy",3

Michele,Not too bad!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BRO0YA8BYMZZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9W2LL3T,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 4, 2023",Fit Type: 2.5'' High waistedSize: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I can understand if my review title isn’t convincing, but I’ll explain. I’m someone who reads a lot of reviews before I commit, and there were some mixed ones on this item. I wanted a pair of athletic shorts that didn’t cost me $50+ and were high-waisted, so I tried these. The material is lightweight, moisture-wicking, and has decent stretch in it. I personally LOVE the seat coverage of the built-in brief. Too often, shorts with a brief liner ride up when you move and these cover like a full-coverage bottom, so no wedgie worry! Win. Some reviews said the back was too long - I disagree. I have longer legs than torso and a rounder bottom, so I loved the back length. Where I’m a little bummed.. The shorts do ride up in the front, and they will if you have a more quad-dominant leg. Because they’re a nice, longer length with a more flat front (to be more flattering, no doubt!), there’s nowhere else for the fabric to go once you start moving and walking. If I wanted to wear these shorts for a casual, athleisure outfit, the ride would bother me because I’d have to keep pulling them down. Since I plan to work out in them, run, play volleyball, I guess I won’t have to tug them up in front? I am 5’7, 160lbs, and I ordered a medium based on the size chart measurements. I feel this is the most appropriate size, as a L would have been too “balloon-y”. So overall, they’re not too bad! I will probably get other pairs to rotate, just wish that the front didn’t “pooch” out as much.",39

The only issue I have is the pocket being on the left side. If you’re right handed like me, the pocket would be better on the right side.  The description says it’s on the left, but I didn’t realize it until I received them.  Not a deal breaker though!",
Kim,Love it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NN10M5BNW4O5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9W2LL3T,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 12, 2022",Fit Type: 2.5'' High waistedSize: SmallColor: Violet,Verified Purchase,"I got three pairs of these in gray-blue, lavender, and black. I love them all! I tried medium and small and went with the small side (I’m 5’7” and 125 lbs). Two reasons I didn’t give 5 stars:  1. I love the phone pocket, but I think it would be even better if there were instead spandex liners with a pocket inside of the shorts. My phone kind of bounces around when I’m wearing these since it’s attached to the loose outer part. It hasn’t been a huge problem—I don’t notice it once I’ve been running for a few minutes, although sometimes I find myself pulling up the shorts a little bit since my phone seems to drag them down about an inch or so on one side every now and then. Which leads me to my next suggestion… 2. These would be awesome with a hidden drawstring. They fit well without it, but for someone who’s running with a phone in their pocket, they tend to slide down a tiny bit after a while, which could be easily remedied by adding a drawstring inside of them.  All in all I love the colors, material, and the fact that I don’t have to wear my phone on one of those annoying arm band things! And they look super cute!",32

I love them. I have a small and a medium. They both fit and look good but i do like the medium fit a little bit better. Neither really gives me a muffin top but the mediums are a tad bit more comfortable when sitting. Im 5 8 and 130 lbs.,

They are the perfect combination of comfort and style, and I can't recommend them enough.  Firstly, I have to mention how comfortable these shorts are. They are made from a lightweight and breathable fabric that is perfect for running and other athletic activities. They move with my body and don't feel restrictive or tight, which is essential for me when I'm trying to stay active.  But the best part is how cute they look! The pink color is vibrant and fun, and the design is sleek and flattering. I've received so many compliments on these shorts, and they make me feel confident and stylish even when I'm working out.  I've worn these shorts on multiple runs now, and they have held up incredibly well. They don't ride up or chafe, and they stay in place throughout my entire workout. Plus, they have a convenient pocket that's perfect for storing my phone or keys.  Overall, I can confidently say that these pink athletic shorts are the perfect addition to any active wardrobe. They are comfortable, stylish, and great for running or other workouts. If you're looking for a new pair of shorts that will make you look and feel great, then look no further!",19

These were the undisputed winner!  Perfect length to look cute in dance class without showing too much butt or cellulite(!), perfect waist (high enough to cover my stomach w. a cute cropped workout tank), perfect style with a rounded hem that lengthens the leg, perfect amount of give, perfect liner short (that's not too tight) for security and modesty, great colors...and great price! i adore them!

Ajali Shabazz,THANK YOU to All the Reviewers!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C8G6VLYX8UQK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9W2LL3T,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 28, 2023",Fit Type: 2.5'' High waistedSize: LargeColor: Neongreen,Verified Purchase,"How valuable reviews are, as I learned these run small. Thus, I ordered a large, when I wear a medium, while wondering if I'd made a mistake. BUT NO. Everyone who shared these shorts are tiny were right. Medium would have been quite constricting as the large is very snug. Also, I hate panty lines, so I cut out the inner panty, because I wear thigh length leggings, anyway. Being a modest woman, these shorts are just a tad too short for me, but they wouldn't be so for the average woman - meaning? They're not booty shorts. The backside is actually longer than the front. Overall, they're a good purchase, given the color is bright and cheery, and the cut allows for thicker thighs, which I have. I wish they had one more pocket, though, as I carry my keys, walkman and handkerchief during runs. That's the only truly awkward issue.  Update: I've gone running wearing these shorts and they're just what I needed. There were no bunching issues. while I solved the pocket problem by pinning a cut off toe and foot section of a misfit sock. I just placed another pair in another color in my shopping cart. Good Buy.",23
