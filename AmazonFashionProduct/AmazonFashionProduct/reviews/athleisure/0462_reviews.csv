However, there are a couple of quality concerns. On three out of the five, I noticed a wad of thread hanging from the sleeve seam under the arm. I had to cut, tie it off, and remove the excess thread myself.  Also, the V-neck stitching at the bottom point isn’t quite perfect. There’s a small wrinkle on each one. It’s not glaring but still noticeable.  Despite these minor annoyances, I still think they’re a great addition to my wardrobe and expect to wear them often.",7

I had read varying reviews and some people had reported that they had holes or were fraying when they got them. I inspected and tried on each shirt when it arrived. All seem to be made well, with no issues. They also have washed well so far without coming apart at the seams. *** I do recommend pre-washing with LIKE colors, or alone before wearing or washing them with other clothes, as I did not ore-wash them, and the darker colors left color staining under my arms*** They are very comfortable, moisture-wicking, and help keep me cool. Size: They run a bit big. I purchased medium shirts, and for what I'm using them for, they fit okay. They are a bit roomy and long though, and I am considering purchasing more in a small to see how those fit.",17

These are true to size. I’m 5’9” and 300# having recently lost 40# and going down from a 3x to a 2x. I was happy to find these are a true 2x. They are just long enough to cover the apron belly but not any longer. There is room in the sleeves, well there is room overall as they are not form fitting or clingy, and the shirts do not shrink in the dryer. These are not stretchy shirts either, they are “just there” on your body. Perhaps that’s what I don’t like about them? I’m not really sure exactly what it is that I don’t like. I just know it has something to do with the appearance while wearing them. I have some old ratty cotton t-shirts that I feelI are more flattering to my body than these are. They are not bad looking, but definitely not “omg that shirt is so cute on you!” They are super soft and silky to the touch, and keep their “shape” as well as remain wrinkle free after wearing and washing. They definitely stay dry when faced with sweat and feel cool to the touch at all times.  For the price, and for the gym the shirts work.",22

Amazonlover,Versatile and Stylish Activewear: A Breath of Fresh Color in Your Workout Wardrobe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35EYNB9G2AQVJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07KPL192B,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 15, 2023",Special Size: Regular SizeSize: LargeColor: Set 10,Verified Purchase,"My journey with the Real Essentials 5 Pack of Women’s Short Sleeve V-Neck Activewear T-Shirts has been a delightful addition to my workout wardrobe. I embarked on this purchase with a desire for comfortable and stylish workout tops, and I have been pleasantly rewarded with an array of T-shirts that have enhanced my exercise routine.  Although the T-shirts have been a wonderful addition to my activewear collection, there is one minor issue that I’d like to address. I’ll share my comprehensive experience with these T-shirts, highlighting both the positive aspects and the minor drawback.  👚🌈 Variety of Colors: From the moment I received my order, I was impressed with the range of vibrant and diverse colors. These tops have added a burst of color to my workouts, and their versatility means I can wear them casually, too. The rotating shades throughout the week add a dash of excitement to my attire, a small but welcome change from my usual monochrome workout gear.  💦💪 Moisture-Wicking Material: One of the standout features of these T-shirts is their moisture-wicking properties. The fabric efficiently absorbs sweat, keeping me dry during high-intensity workouts. I was pleasantly surprised by how effectively these tops kept me comfortable and dry during long exercise sessions.  📏👚 Accurate Sizing and Comfortable Fit: Finding activewear that fits well can be a challenge, but I was delighted with the accurate sizing and comfortable fit of these tops. They have just the right amount of stretch to allow freedom of movement without being too tight or loose. The V-neck design adds a subtle touch of style to the T-shirts and complements the overall look.  ✨👍 Versatility and Style: The versatility of these T-shirts is a significant advantage. I appreciate the ability to wear them during workouts and as casual tops. Their simple design pairs well with jeans or skirts, providing a stylish yet relaxed look. I love having activewear that easily transitions to casual wear without sacrificing style.  💨🧘‍♀️ Breathable and Lightweight: I’m always on the lookout for activewear that feels light and breathable, and these tops exceeded my expectations. They’re perfect for yoga, running, and high-intensity workouts. I never feel overheated, which makes my workouts more enjoyable and focused.  🌞👕 Minor Issue with Sunlight: Despite the many positives, there is a minor issue with sunlight. I noticed that the material becomes somewhat translucent in direct sunlight, which isn’t ideal for outdoor workouts on sunny days. It’s a small issue, but one worth mentioning for those who frequently exercise outdoors.  Weighing all the factors, I give the Real Essentials Women’s Short Sleeve V-Neck Activewear T-Shirts a well-deserved 4-star rating 🌟🌟🌟🌟. The minor translucency in direct sunlight does not detract from the overall value of these T-shirts. The vibrant colors, moisture-wicking material, comfortable fit, and versatility make them a great addition to any activewear collection.  To my fellow fitness enthusiasts and those in search of comfortable and versatile activewear, I wholeheartedly recommend these T-shirts. They offer both style and functionality, enhancing your workouts and casual wear. So go ahead and add a splash of color to your wardrobe and enjoy the comfort and flexibility of these Real Essentials tops.  Thank you for taking the time to read my detailed review. I hope it helps you make an informed decision and brings you closer to finding the perfect activewear for your needs. Here’s to enjoyable workouts and comfortable casual outings with these T-shirts. Stay active and stylish! 🧘‍♀️🏃‍♀️💃",293

I liked that I could get a pack of 5 all in black so I can grab and go in the morning regardless of pants color. They are cheap enough that I wasn’t worried about dropping a bunch of money on 5 shirts that I haven’t seen in person. I was looking for something that I could tuck in without being form fitting that would also move with me and be breathable and wrinkle resistant and these seem to fit the bill on all of those counts but full disclosure I haven’t worn for a shift yet. I ordered a medium to ensure they would be loose and the fit is just as I’d hoped, for a more form hugging fit I would imagine a size small in my case would do the trick. They arrived with a weird chemical smell but it washed out and they held their shape and size after one wash. The quality is somewhat questionable, the seams are bunchy, but the black color hide it well, I see other reviews where the weird seams are more apparent with the lighter fabric. Hard to say how well they will hold up long term with frequent wash and wear. The fabric itself has a transparency to it when held to the light but doesn’t seem noticeable during wear. Am I over the moon thrilled with these tops? Nope, I would have been disappointed and possibly even returned them if I had ordered lighter colors because the seams are just so sloppy. But for my purposes, they’ll do.",23
