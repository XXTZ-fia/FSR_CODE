I'm not a golfer but I bought this for horseback riding because of the sun protection factor built into the fabric. The fabric is substantial but with great breathability. I'm not a golfer but use them for horseback riding.  They're super comfortable and have a very flattering fit. I come home smelling like a horse stable and toss it in the washer, and air dry on a hangar, and it comes out wrinkle free, smelling great and looking brand new wash after wash. Very very happy with this purchase.  In fact, I ended up buying ten of these shirts because they come in such great patterns and colors. I get compliments almost every time I wear them.",

These completely cover my elbow but are still shorter than 3/4 length. I also like the raglan sleeve and the curved hem. I prefer a johnny collar over the zip, and this particular collar prefers to stand; the top of the unzipped zipper rubbed my neck uncomfortably. The pretty fabric feels thick and plastic; it did not prove comfortable on a warm humid day. There are no written care instructions on the tag, but the symbols indicate not to tumble dry.  I don't understand why I can't find this sleeve length anywhere else; with an aging population it should be very popular.

Most complexions don’t look all that great in orange.  I would give much higher marks to the zebra pattern and the greenish ocean-type pattern if I were reviewing those alone.
