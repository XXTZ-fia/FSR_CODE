I purchased the both Black and Olive. So far, I have only tried the black one on. The material is amazing, so soft and comfortable. Very clean sleek design. I'm just slightly over 5'2"" and my weight right now is fluctuating between 157 to 162. I ordered a size medium and fits perfectly except that the length of the pants is just a tad bit long. However, i wouldn't mind this lounging around the house. if you are wearing shoes with more of a platform like some Hoka shoes then it should be fine. The olive color is beautiful but yet to try it on.",20

Regular family,Waist is too tight!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15HRA6HYXD1CU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM5QT2DG,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Color: Navy BlueSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I love the fabric and cut and everything about this set EXCEPT that the waist is too tight! I do not understand why the manufacturer would make the waist so small when it is elastic and has a drawstring for adjustment. Otherwise, the medium fits perfectly. I ordered a large to see if it would fit better, but it is too baggy overall (although the waist on the large fits more comfortably, it is still too snug for athleisure). Was hoping to wear these for travel, but the waist is a problem. For reference, I am 153 pounds and 5 ft 5 1/2 in tall.

I can’t say how it will hold up over time, but it seems high quality. The material feels very soft and comfortable. I would say that the material is medium thickness, warm enough to wear out and about shopping in the winter if you don’t live in a really cold climate. Definitely appropriate for the fall too.  It seems to be made a little oversized in a good, modern way. The pants are fitted at the waist and hips but flare out at the bottom. The top sits just below the waist line, short enough to have that modern feel but not so short that your stomach is exposed when you raise your arms. My only negative is that the top I ordered doesn’t have pockets. However, the description doesn’t claim that it has pockets, I guess I just assumed that it would.",10
Tay,a cute upgrade to my sweat sets,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BSUBUWBCQ2OL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CM5QT2DG,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Color: Hot PinkSize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"the quality of this set is SO much better than I usually find on Amazon! I'm a big fan of this set; I prioritize comfort in my wardrobe and being able to wear something that's not only cute but cozy is an instant win in my book! i got the hot pink set to wear to a pink-themed birthday party and while the color is out of my comfort zone, I actually really love how rich and saturated the hue is.  the material is thick and has a silky smoothness on both the inside and outside. occasionally one of my kitten's claws will get caught in it and leave a little snag, but for the most part i've been able to work the snags back into the weave.  i got the XXL and i'm around 5'2"" and 230lbs. i carry most of my weight around the bottom half, and despite that I've found that both halves of the set fit me really well! the sleeves of the top are perfectly baggy; the body of the top has a lot of room for my chest; the waistband on the top is a little too short to pull down as far as I usually like it and it's a bit tight on my hips, but it flips up nicely to where the small of my waist is and gives the top a flattering flouncy shape. the pants have the perfect boot-cut shape for wearing with chunky slippers. they're not baggy at the torso-covering, but rather more fitted; despite this, I think they still look really flattering (and my lower stomach is usually the part of my body i'm the most self-conscious about concealing).  honestly, i'm planning on buying this set in a few more colors. would absolutely recommend!",9

The fabric is not quite as soft but the weight and feel of it are spot on. The look is spot on too. I am 5’4 120lbs and the small (Amazon recommended size) was a perfect fit. EXCEPT the pants were far too long. I would either have to let them drag or wear heels. I’m not sure if the thick fabric could be hemmed. If they come up with a petite pant size, I would absolutely buy these over spanx. The pants have POCKETS which it absolutely blows my mind that the spanx ones don’t. How do people function without pockets? If you’re debating spanx but pausing on the price tag or lack of pockets, get these first. If you’re 5’4 or shorter though, the spanx petite pants size small fit me perfectly in size and length.",22

I find the price to be much better of course. I have used this a total of maybe 7 times - all for trips, both long and short haul.  The first 2 times, it was fantastic. The pants were as seen on the model. But after washing, the pants definitely shrunk and so now I have short a-line pants which is not the look I was going for at all.  That said, I wore this when pregnant and they were so comfortable and covered my bump. People could not even tell I was pregnant. The material is so soft and breathable. I also like the style- can be dressed up or down and perfect for the cold plane rides.",

I’m having same issues.  Pros: comfortable, perfect for travel, buttery feel  Cons: fabric holds “stains” way too easily, even just water droplets. They do not dissipate as they normally would on other fabric. Very strange and my niece had the same complaint. Less than ideal during travel as the areas where water had landed while washing my hands remained noticeable. I bought a lighter and darker color. I would stick to dark colors that don’t show as badly. The “stained” areas came out in the wash but not ideal that water or water and soap alone should cause such a lasting mark. See the other review where someone wore hers with wet hair. Also seems to pill too quickly and had a few loose threads after one wash on gentle.  I don’t regret the purchase as they were perfect for my airplane travel but I don’t hold much hope in how they’ll stand up to the test of time and regular wear and tear.",2

Cons-no pockets, and the price.  This set pros-pockets, lower price. Cons-not quite as soft, but still fantastic! Pants are just a tad long on me. Not bad, but about an inch too long.

The apricot color is very sheer and the pants are a bit hard to pull off. You can see the pockets through the front material on your thighs, and your backside is on display. I have a long waist so require a high rise, which I think sometimes makes pants show off my backside more than most. So perhaps not as much of an issue for everyone.

It’s so soft and heavy, stretchy fabric, perfect for cold days lounging or running  out to the store. I bought a small and I’m 5’2” and 150lbs. It fits good… I’m a little thick in the thighs and it’s a little firm fitting through that area. I’m small on top so the top fits very loose. If i would have ordered at medium it would have been too big on top. The length is actually good for me and everything is usually super long.",
