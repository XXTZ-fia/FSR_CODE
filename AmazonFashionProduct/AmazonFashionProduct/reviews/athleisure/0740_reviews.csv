They were definitely too small on me, so I say stick to your regular sizing. That being said, I didn't really care for the leggings otherwise. The material feels very thin, and although not sheer, does seem to cling to areas I'd rather not call attention to. Additionally, the stretch felt minimal, and almost compression like.

Texas Shopper,Great quality. Order your regular size.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4TWWI01ZZ60Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CL15J543,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 13, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,,"I normally wear a size large in leggings, but lately have been disappointed by a couple of brands that run very small. So I thought I'd be clever and order up, but in this Amazon Essentials brand, the next size up is too large for me. So these do run true to size and I recommend ordering your regular size for a comfortable fit. The fabric is nice and stetchy and of great quality; it is fairly thick and passes the squat test, for sure. The fabric has a slight sheen and is very smooth as opposed to a brushed, cottony feel. The waistband fits securely and does not slip down, despite the size I ordered being a size too big. And of course these have the all-important side pockets that perfectly fit a cell phone. How did we ever get by before, without the cell phone pockets? These machine wash and dry with no issues, and come out of the dryer looking brand new with no shrinking, fading or pilling.  Overall these are terrific basic capri leggings that are well priced but of great quality. You'll wear them again and again. I recommend ordering your regular size for a comfortable fit and perhaps sizing down if you want a more compressive fit.",

I wish there was a little more compression in the tummy though, even though they are snug they don't feel like that compression hug actually gives. They do have nifty pockets though and of course I can't wait to lose 20 more pounds, and I will try them on again each 5 I lose and see if I can wear them the way I like too. Do they rate as high as Old Navy ones, not quite. Not bad, are they good enough- I say yes.",

My favorite thing about these leggings is that the fabric isn't white underneath, which is absolutely the sign of quality. These are blue underneath, which means you can bend and squat knowing the pattern and color are not going to look washed out and cheap when you do.  I wish they were like 2 inches longer, because they tend to shift up to the bend in my knees.",2
