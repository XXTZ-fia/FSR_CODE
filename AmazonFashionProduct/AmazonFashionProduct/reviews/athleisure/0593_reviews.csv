The finger holes for the jacket are way too small and tight and the location of the finger hole is too high that it makes it awkward to pull the jacket over the hand to use so these are pointless. The other obnoxious and harder to ignore defect is the front pockets are sewn for the back so you have front pockets that open on to your butt,

Ordered the blue, size small. Very nice color. Decent stretch. Medium weight fabric. Arms are too short which makes thumb holes unusable. Wide waistband on the zip top gives a figure flattering look, though the zipper isn’t effortless, it gets stuck... Well sewn stretch waistband with drawstring, seams down from waistband to bottom of pant in back and front. According to the size chart, size small pants are at least 40” long. Mine measured 38“. I really need a 41” pant to be able to wear with flats and have it fit me right. Took a chance on these though but didn’t work out for me, unfortunately. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Other than sleeves and pants being very short, the fit was pretty perfect in shoulders waist hips and butt. Fabric is just okay. Don’t love it...Fast fashion. 65%Polyester 30%Cotton 5%Elastane. Really wanted this one to work but another NO. Will return. Hope this is helpful as I’m always looking for height and weight and measurements in reviews to help make purchasing decisions easier. 😉",

It is also warm without being too warm. I can’t believe I look so cute in joggers and a hoodie! I also love the hood. I am very photo sensitive and I wear the hood up to keep the sun off my face and use my hair to cover my upper neck. I also adore the thumb holes. I can tell this is not only going to be a morning walk staple, but also used for when ever I need good range of motion and to look good doing what ever the heck I want to to.  The price is so low for the quality. I’m a bit shocked that it is soft, breathable and durable. I have been using it daily for a week on workout and the inner thighs have not pilled. I even did yoga and 1 mile of waking a day. Yeah… I just placed an order for 2 more! I’m also tempted to buy the next size down for when I need it, but realized that’s what the working drawstring and stretchy waist is for. I will still buy more when I need to, but I don’t have to panic waiting for a few days as the new ones come in so I can be comfy and confident gain.. (I got off meds that made me gain 20 lb in 3 months. I’m already dropping the weight without trying.)  My ONLY negative is that the zipper is rough. If I’m not careful my thin nails break on it while zipping and it’s not smooth when you pull up the zipper. But I just take a little extra care when zipping up and it so far has not caught on my fine long hair or my delicate mesh workout tops. So I’m happy and it did not deter me from buying 2 more.",19
