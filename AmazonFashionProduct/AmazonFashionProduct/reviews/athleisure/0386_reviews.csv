I am plus size due to medications and working on slimming down; I have been a rock climber for the past 13 years. The past few years have seen fewer and fewer climbs as not only my weight has spiraled but it's hard to find clothing that I can climb in that isn't too tight or too loose or horrific looking. I feel like I want to climb in a burqa at my weight, I am HORRIBLY self-conscious but the sport doesn't really allow for that. I bought one of these tops thinking it would be probably another dismal failure.  It wasn't, I love it, and I have 4 more in my cart for when I get paid tomorrow. it feels like I am wearing nothing yet when I look in a mirror I am all covered especially my scary bits aka midsection. I don't LOVE how I look in photos, even these ones, but for once I feel unencumbered and can go and boulder a little with my climbing friends even though I am not yet at a great weight for climbing. And I will share these less than awesome pics that my partner took of me bouldering because it shows what an XL looks like on a 225 lb, 5'6"" woman.  Progress, not perfection. I am SO relieved to have found these tops and recommend to any woman: they are true to size and they do a really good job covering what's needed without being tight or constricting OR being too loose and flowy and getting in the way.",67

I am short and chunky ( Hips,thighs and big bottom & Chest I bought X-Large in almost every color and style and the size/style has been sewn consistently the same. The tops in extra large completely cover my bottom with Room to spare. I always wear a camisole underneath. My Dog walking and Exercise Outfit. This is my own personal preference.
