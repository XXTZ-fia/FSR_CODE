The sweater jacket I had been waiting for... The quality is nice, warm and soft. However, it's just a bit too short for my liking.  It hits between my waist and hips.  When I bend over it comes up too far.  Gave 5 stars because it's nice but I won't be wearing this as much as I hoped.",14

I like that it has pockets, sits a bit below the waist on me with a thick elastic type banding. Looser fit at this size, soft and comfy. I normally order mediums but because it's all cotton, I expect a bit of shrinkage, so either way it should be a great throw on hoodie without the hood. Cons: bright silver zipper. I would have preferred black, but at least this one has a black placket unlike others I've seen that are white. Looks nice, dressed up or down.

I can live with slight fade and shrinkage, but I absolutely HATE when manufacturers cut corners on sewing the facing down of a button or zipper panel fabric strip.  It causes the inner facing to crinkle up and look extremely cheap after a wash or two.  To resolve this I have to sew extra seams down the front of the garment to properly tack the facing down.
