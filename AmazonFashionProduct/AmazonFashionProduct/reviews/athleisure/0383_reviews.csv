I'm 5'6"" and the 31"" inseam is perfect with my Skechers sneakers; nice & long without hitting the floor. Last year when I weighed 190lbs the 1X size fit like a charm; now I'm 165 and the X-Large is perfect.  The pocket is great for holding my phone in a pinch. Love these pants!",

These are thinner than all of them, but I can live with that. The problem is the sizing is off. I have muscular thighs and a very small waist. Every pair of yoga pants I own is a large and they fit me fine. After trying a xl and a 1x, I completely gave up. The 1x fit my thighs but was way too big in the waist. I had to return them.  Also, the coral color is pretty, but the lavender pants (on the right in the photo) is NOT a true lavender. More like a weird pale purple grey.",

These Ofenti yoga pants are rated my #1 winner for being easiest to manage wrinkles, easy care, comfortable wear & great appearance  Care: -wrinkle management: easiest care fabric of all the sports / lounge clothes I tried of various fabrics; so easy -I simply followed the tag instructions: for cold water wash & air dry: -relax the fabric: I allow time to soak with soap + fabric softener, so the fibers can relax as an important step to get rid of packaging wrinkles; rinse with fabric softener; lay flat to dry or hang to dry. (I stretch them a little by hand, or smooth by hand if needed, if any slight wrinkles are present) -this was the only garment that gave such simple care, & looked perfectly wrinkle free from the packaging wrinkles, due to the fabric blend. No wrinkle release spray was even needed, as I needed for the others  Appearance: -I find these yoga pants have such a nice appearance, & can even look like dressier pants, depending on how they worn. With the right shirt/ blouse plus heels, I will use them as ‘dressier’ pants. For me, they are a way to dress casual, comfortable, yet without wearing less dressy blue jeans. I like them better than most dress pants I’ve ever worn. I can see wearing them to art festivals/ museums, shopping, & even church with a longer blouse. With a tank or t-shirt, they serve as yoga pants/ exercise/ pickleball/ Zumba dance pants  Sizing: I ordered a L, at 5'4"", c. 150lbs & they fit GREAT; not too tight or loose. Just right. I like the length, to wear with platform sandals/ shoes/ boots  -I love the versatility, ease of wash/ care, appearance, large pockets, style, soft comfortable fabric; just everything about them",

These are such a great quality pant. The material is soft, constricting without being too tight, and fit perfectly in the waist. I love that these have pockets! The color is nice too, it's a different kind of grey than your regular sweat pants. I definitely feel these are a great value for a great product. I do recommend looking at the size chart for the pants, as they run true to size. Overall, I love these!",

BR,Comfy but shorter than advertised,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SDDFNVZ40RDE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSR9G2VH,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 18, 2024","Fit Type: Flared 28"" Inseam (Regular)Size: SmallColor: Burgundy",,"These leggings are comfy and fit well for me. Love the pockets and variety of color options. I like the $25 price point. I am 5'2"" and 126 lbs, and I got my usual size small and they fit true to size. However, they are advertised as a 28"" inseam which should be borderline too long for me (I usually do 26-27"" inseams), but these are almost too short for me even at my 5'2"" height, which never happens, so these must be closer to 25"". So be aware the inseams are not accurately described, at least on the regular length; can't speak to the accuracy of the tall sizes they also offer. My only other complaint at this time is that they put the tag inside right on the seamline going down the middle of the butt, causing an unavoidable lump right there, so I'll have to the cut the tag out. Overall as long as you take into account the inseam length (removed a star for the inaccuracy), I think these are good value for the price. Will update this review if I have any issues with laundering or longer term wear.",
brmacy,nice fit; stitching is eh,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3Y56WIWOXEDC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSR9G2VH,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 8, 2024","Fit Type: Flared 31"" Inseam (Tall)Size: 1XColor: Brick",,"I wanted to try a new style of leggings, since I have been wearing skinny style since the early 2000's. These are really comfortable! The color is a really pretty burnt orange color and the fabric is nice and thick. The pockets are actually functional too, which is a huge plus. My one issue is the stitching. I wore these once, and there is already a break in the double seam in the bottom. It was a distinct rip sound when I was doing squats and I thought I ripped a full hole. Thankfully these do have a double seam and the second thicker seam is holding well. These are definitely more for lounging and less for active working out.",

I love the feel of the material though and the color is super pretty. They're not completely opaque, so I likely wouldn't have worn them to a yoga class, but they would have been fine around the house or with a longer top that covered my backside. I'm hoping a shorter friend of mine likes them because they're really comfortable!",

FWIW, the hips, seat, and leg width all fit fine.  I do like the curved seaming on the back, as it's flattering. The pockets are deep enough for my phone.  The leg openings are nowhere near a ""flare"" style. They look like they are supposed to be regular leggings that got cut wrong. They don't have as much ""slouch"" as they look in the photos.",
