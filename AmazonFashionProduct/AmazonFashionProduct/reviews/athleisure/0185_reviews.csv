I normally wear an extra small/small, but I decided to size up to a medium since I have a long torso. I’m glad I did. Even though it’s an oversized hoodie, it is short.

It is thick so is very warm and it’s a truly a nice white color.  The fabric is really soft and nice but as I mentioned in my video you need to wash it before wearing it because it lints.  I did the video as soon as I got it out of the package and it didn’t have any funny smell or anything out of the ordinary. It came well package.  It is really true to size. For reference I am 5’8” and I weight around 145 and 150 pounds and I ordered it in a size medium because I wanted the oversized look. Bit I could fit in a size small as well. I love the little holes to put your thumbs. The zipper is well made and I think it will last.  I used it mostly as I cover up to and from the gym (mostly because I spent my day in sports clothes) I do recommend and I will be buying more colors in the future.,12

The pockets on this were sitting at my chest rather than the stomach/waist. The coffee gray color was also more like a dirty looking light pink. So between fit and color, I will be returning.",

Kindle Customer,Do not trust the size chart,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Y3ZB2R127U3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CVVQ8D7W,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 12, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"The sweatshirt is nice (thick, soft, well-made) but the *length* on the size chart is off by about 2 inches, which is a lot. This is a CROPPED sweatshirt (as it says in the description, but not the name). Since I was ordering an XL and am only 5'2"", I relied on the size chart, but that was substantially off from the actual product measurements. Two inches is the difference between something that hits at low-hip versus high-hip, and for me, flattering versus not. I am passing this along to my daughter. I would give this 5 stars if the length matched the description, because it really is a well-made item, and a good value for the discounted price that I paid. Unfortunately, the length makes this unwearable for me.",

But...the hype is legit! This hoodie is so flattering and comfy. It is surprisingly great quality with that thick squishy feel. The zipper down or up is cute. The grey green color looks luxe and creamy. I'm on a fitness/weight loss journey and currently at 209lbs, ordering a XL. It is perfectly oversized. I know it will still look great the more I lose. Now...to avoid my toxic trait to order multiple colors in something I love. 😬***The only tiny negative was that the plastic zipper ends had sharpe unfinished edges that scratched my neck. I used my nail grinder to buff it and all better. I hope it doesn't shrink in the dryer.",24

I noticed the plastic it came in already had a hole and didn't think anything of it until I found a used tissue in the pocket. (Pictured) Looked like it was only used for makeup. Not a huge deal as nothing else seems to be wrong and I can wash just didn't expect that after already trying it on.",

It’s thick enough to be warm, the pocket is large enough for my phone and keys and stocked high enough that they don’t slip out when moving around or bending over the way some of my sweatshirt pockets let me down.

I love the overall warmth and coziness and will wear these in the Minnesota winters outside for sure! The sleeves are rather clown-like and pooly designed with no taper going down to the tight cuff so it bunches up awkwardly and feels and looks uncomfortable. There is just way too much fabric used in the sleeves and it didn't have to be that way. I'll stick to JOYLAB for looks, quality and price (much cheaper on sale, 100% cotton).",

Me,Adorable but inconsistent,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P7N735APC9XV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CVVQ8D7W,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 3, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Green,Verified Purchase,"Let me start with the good. I ordered 2 of these and they’re super cute in style and function. Both are very thick and fluffy to wear which will keep you warm in the cold months. The colors (both unwashed at this point) are exactly as I expected them to be and I hope they stay that way, one reviewer noted after washing all of the color faded. The hood fits over my head and stays even with my hair in a ponytail or a bun, not a lot of hoods have that much extra material in them and I see this as a plus. They are cropped but not excessively so, they hit me right at my hip bones for the back and just about an inch above in the front. Cropped is cute but too short and you loose the function of the sweatshirt and living just outside of NYC, well… we need warmth in the winter but we want fashion too. These give you both! Now for the bad…. The sizing is inconsistent. The arms on the coffee color I ordered are about a half inch shorter on each side than the green one. I did order both in the same size and checked to make sure they sent both in the correct size. Normally this wouldn’t be a huge issue but if I plan to use the thumb holes in the coffee color I can’t because this has now made the sleeves too short and literally cuts into my thumbs if I move my arms from anything but a bent position. I did size up for extra room, something I often have to do as I have longer arms and the green is perfect. Also the thumb holes on the coffee color are cut ever so slightly smaller than the ones on the green version. Overall it feels like the coffee is labeled wrong and is a size smaller than listed on the tag. Will I keep them? Yes! Do I love the color and style? Yes! Do I wish the sizing was more consistent? Also yes! In the end I am keeping them and we shall see how they hold up once they’re run through the washer but I don’t think I’ll be ordering more considering the regular price was above $50. Although I did catch them on sale so this can go in the list of pluses, the company does run sales.",30

This dupe here I can totally get behind though, especially if they are running any type of discount like when I purchased. I may even purchase a second color. It’s definitely warm enough (i tend to run very warm) and while the construction isn’t perfect, it’s good enough for the price.  The Grey green color is definitely more sea foam green than what the picture advertises but still very pretty. It just shows EVERYTHING. Any little droplet of water that hits this thing shows, so that isn’t the best. Also, in general I would size up. I could have done a large through the width of the waist, chest, and shoulders but it would have been too short in the waist. And oddly enough, I feel like the sleeves run a little short. The thumb holes are great but don’t align quite how I would want them to. But still, for the price, I’m happy.",3

Ashley,Hyperfixation hoodie,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OTTHQLVMEXJ9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CVVQ8D7W,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 11, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Pink,Verified Purchase,Edit: took stars off because the sleeves have shrunk significantly after 1 month. The sweatshirt has only been washed and dried 2-3 times but the sleeves are about half an inch shorter. Will probably return the other 2 I purchased since this one is 2 days outside of the return window.  Had to buy 2 colors because I want to wear this sweatshirt every day. Will probably get one or two more. Love the cropped fit and quarter zip.,
