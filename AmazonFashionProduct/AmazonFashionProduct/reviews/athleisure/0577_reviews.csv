I ordered the color Green504 in a Small and love how it fits! Sweater is comfy and a little oversized. Can be worn off the shoulder a bit as seen in pictures if wanted but also stays put if you prefer not to. The fabric is what I’d consider medium weight in thickness. Definitely won’t keep you warm if worn alone outside in colder temps but did keep me comfortable (but not hot) inside at work where the halls are freezing and the temperature fluctuates from hot to cold from room to room. (I work in a junior high school) I tend to run hot and never felt overheated while wearing and running around the building with my busy schedule accompanying students with special needs to their classes. It’s currently the beginning of November in Arkansas and about 60 degrees outside during the day. I wore the shirt without a coat or extra layer and was quite comfortable. Very happy with my purchase! I’ve only worn it once but seems as though it will hold up in regard to wear and tear. I hope this helps! :-),16
