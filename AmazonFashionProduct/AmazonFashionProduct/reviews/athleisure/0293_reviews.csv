I wear a S/M, 36 C, and I usually wear a M/L in my workout tops because I don’t like them to be too tight, ride up, or cling. The fabric is soft, thin, moisture-wicking, and stretchy. It didn’t ride up during my workouts. I like the detailing on the back although I do think it made my back look broader than it already is, coral color is really pretty, and the thumbholes. The sleeves were the perfect length for me and I did use the thumb holes but if u have long arms the sleeves might not fit right. It was comfortable to workout in but it wasn’t very flattering on me. It fits but I would’ve liked a looser and longer fit. It arrived really wrinkled but I just tossed it in the dryer and most of the wrinkles fell out.",6

I got the wine red, and it's a lovely deep shade. The fabric is soft and lightweight. Good for layers. The sleeves are long enough. I hate the feeling of constantly tugging the sleeves down when a long-sleeved shirt doesn't quite reach or stay at the wrist. Solid seam around the thumb hole. This should be a useful feature while working out.  Cons: It's too thin. While layering can be nice, I don't wear long sleeves unless I want at least a little warmth, and there is none here. The seams are not completely straight. The seam on one side comes forward a bit. It's not terribly noticeable, but still a flaw. It might run a bit small. The L fits my 37"" chest with no room to spare.",
