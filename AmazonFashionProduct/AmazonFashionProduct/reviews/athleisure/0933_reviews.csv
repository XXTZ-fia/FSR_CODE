I sat crisscross applesauce for 30 minutes to test the elasticity and no saggy pants bottom. They’re flattering to my shape, are not bulky at all, stretchy enough to wear thermals underneath in snowy conditions, waterproof against a shower head, and they don’t make that zippy sound that regular snow pants make when you walk. They also have deep pockets with zippers so the pockets don’t make the weird flappy bulges that most pant pockets make after you actually use the pockets.

I really like the outer material is not collecting dog hair like other fabrics. The waist is high, but the drawstring makes it easy to adjust.
