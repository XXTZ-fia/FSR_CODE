I am 5”1’ tall and 108 pounds. My hip is 37.” And my natural waist is 26.5” but my belly button circumference where most waistbands sit is 32” when I am bloated and 30” when I am not. I usually have to wear a small or medium but it depends on the brand and cut. I used the size chart based on waist for when I am bloated. And I ordered a large based on the waist 31-33”. That was a huge mistake. I included photos. Because I am only 5”1’ these pants at a 28 inch inseam are way too long. Use your natural waist not where the pants would sit. When I order shorts I do have to use my belly button circumference as my waist in order to not get a muffin top. But these joggers are very generous. Even if I had ordered a canal or small they would still be way too long.,3

The waist is elastic with a drawstring, so I would err on sizing up. I don't wear them for hiking or anything outdoors/athletic, I WFH and am building up comfortable 'real' clothes to work in that I can also leave the house in as my prior job was business professional, I am lacking and these are perfect.

I like to see the clothing in person, so I can get an idea of quality, material, and fit.  I've looked for joggers for over a year now. I've bought a couple of joggers (one is name brand, one is off-brand, one pair from a big box store, and another pair from the ladies department at an outdoors/sports store) from different places, but I never quite liked the fit. So, overall, I LOVE THESE PANTS!! I like the Lisbin cargo jogger pants version better than the non-cargo.

Well, come to find out the black in these pants was rubbing off on my skin, even if I'd washed the pants dozens of times.
