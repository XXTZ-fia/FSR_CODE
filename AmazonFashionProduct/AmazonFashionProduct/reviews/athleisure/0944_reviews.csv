H Hamilton,"Stylish and nice fit, but the material does not breath",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24R6OCUXZWISK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CT92M38Z,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 20, 2024",Color: GreySize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"The fit and cut is very flattering.  I paired it with a pair of hiking pants for an outdoor adventure and the look was perfect.  However, I was very disappointed by its lack of breathability.  Fortunately I had another tank along, as within minutes of getting active and starting to sweat, I had to shuck this shirt.  It made me feel terribly sticky and hot.",
Emmy Gabriel,Great quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHMZCERH3Y9DY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CT92M38Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 8, 2024",Color: GreenSize: 3X-Large,Verified Purchase,I typically wear a 2-3× in shirts. I don't like when material is the stretchy stuff that clings to my belly. This tank top is perfect. No clinging.  True to size. The thick band at the bottom hides my belly well.  I got the teal green color. It's super soft too!  I will buy it over and over in more colors. For reference I'm 5'5 234 lbs and carry my weight in my stomach,

The tank fits perfect I recommend you get the size you normally wear. It's especially good if you have a little extra baggage in the front and back. The material is comfortable.,Good tank top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FY0HWK4LC4P3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CT92M38Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 6, 2024",Color: WhiteSize: Large,,It's definitely a good tank top it's comfortable and it's really good if you have a little extra baggage in the front and back. It's also comfortable. I will be purchasing other colors,3
Foster Mama,Nice top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CXMNS7FIIDFU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CT92M38Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 21, 2024",Color: BlackSize: X-Large,,"This turned out to be a nice workout top.

kmrutherford80,Very comfortable and runs just a little big,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3969VXXJ2A5WS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CT92M38Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 12, 2024",Color: BlackSize: X-Large,,This is a super soft very comfortable and flattering tank top.  It has nice band on the bottom that hugs your hips but is not tight at all.  It actually runs just a little big so if you are in between sizes I would size down.  Overall a great tank top though and I am excited for summer weather!,2
