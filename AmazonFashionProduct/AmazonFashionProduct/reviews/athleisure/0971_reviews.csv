Very comfortable and you don’t need a bra.  I wear large. I am in 36DD bust and 10/12 in pants. I have a very long waist and torso so if you are short waisted it will pair well with leggings. It is difficult for me to find longer tops. I get compliments every time I wear them. I am also longer in the shoulders and when I first put this on, it fits a little short in the bra portion where the elastic sits under the bust but it then stretches to be very comfortable. Highly recommend!",
Tahitian Treat,Really good hold for Big Boobs,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22SFCARU5R0GS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BQ68GPQ5,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 6, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Green,Verified Purchase,I ordered this tank  about a year ago in 2023.  I just ordered 5 more. I am a 44 DDD and they are my favorite tanks to put on and do yard or house work. They are also great for a quick run to the grocery store. It’s really hard to find good shelf bra tank tops that offer enough support without squeezing everything too tight. The solid color tanks are cut more generously than the printed and I ended up donating the printed tanks that I ordered in XXL . I only reordered solid colors in XXL.,

You won’t have to layer it with another tank to prevent it from being transparent. The colors won’t bleed or fade in the laundry which leads me to believe this tank will last longer than some of my others. It’s got a decent amount of stretch to it which I like when the weather is hot. My only complaint is that the built in bra lacks the support it needs to keep my girls where they should be. I would consider the built in bra more of a VERY light liner with some triangle pads. The pads in the liner also slide around in the liner so I didn’t feel like I got the coverage I needed. I kept falling out the bottom of the bra/liner so I eventually put on a regular sports bra underneath this tank in order to get the support I required. For reference, I wear a 36DD or 38D bra and I ordered a XL in this tank. I think if I went with a large the bra/liner might have been better, but still not enough to exercise intensely without some kind of added support.",

I normally wear between and M and a L and based on other reviews that said this ran big, I ordered a size M.  It fits perfectly!The outer shirt is made of a medium weight swimsuit like athletic material and there is a shelf bra with pads you can leave in or remove.  The pads are a bit thicker and more structured than typical removable pads and I have found that when I wash this they stay in place better than other bra tops I have with removable pads.The print on this shirt is super cute and vibrant.  I love the length here as well.  I can wear this out and cover my butt or I an tuck it in an pull it out a bit.  Very nice and versatile length.  The support this top provides for me is medium to light; I wear it boxing, walking, and weightlifting, but probably wouldn't wear it running or cycling.The top is soft and comfy.  All of my other bra tops are very formfitting and I love that this one is a more relaxed fit while still being supportive.  I love wearing bra tops in the summer so I don't need to have a separate bra on and I am looking forward to leaving the MN winter behind so I can actually wear this around outside some in a few months!I think this is an amazing top for the price and would buy it in other patterns if they had some other ones.  Recommended!  The sizing chart is accurate so make sure to go by that and not your normal size.",3
