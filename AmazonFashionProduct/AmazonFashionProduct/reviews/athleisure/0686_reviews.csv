Courtney valentino,This outfit is perfect,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LY0HOTBBNYFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ3WX8FR,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 22, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Elemental Blue,Verified Purchase,One of the best amazon purchases I've ever made ! Bought with the pants fits perfectly soft material designer look. Sooooo happy,
Jackie Andreetta,So flattering and soft material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19SD31T5B5E7D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ3WX8FR,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 28, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Iconic Black,Verified Purchase,The style/cut of the tank top is so flattering and I love that the padding is removable. The material is also super soft and comfy to wear to work out or to just lounge in. Will be purchasing in more colors,
Rachel White,Very cute but not super supportive,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KFA09B6EPSPL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ3WX8FR,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Iconic Black,Verified Purchase,If you have a fuller bust you will need a sports bra for working out. I can wear this braless as a going out top as long as I won’t be doing too much dancing.,
Steph,"Comfortable, but not supportive",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D9TF0G0SNTC9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ3WX8FR,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 23, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Everpine,,"I was really excited for this top and waited a long time for it to arrive, but was a bit disappointed when I did show up.  The few things I did like about it first. The color is really nice. I love the dark forrest green. The fabric is also a nice buttery soft material that is very stretchy and soft and smooth to the skin. It does have little slits in the bra area where you can remove the padding.  Now what I think could be improved. First it seems a little big in some areas and too small in others making it not very supportive for doing any actual activities other than sitting on the couch. I am petite but busty and I usually wear smalls and mediums in tops so I went with a medium for this knowing I would probably need more room and coverage in the bra section. I found the band portion to be too loose and I was falling out the bottom but the cups section and neckline to be cut too low/small and I was also falling out of the top. The built in bra barely covered enough of my breasts to keep my nipples inside if I got the band completely under my breasts instead of just sitting on top of them. The straps were also too long for me which contributed to the too low neck line. Over all I probably should have gone with a small or even xs to get the right tightness around my ribcage and length of straps, but at that point the cups would have definitely been far, far too small.  I would not recommend this top for anyone who is on the more busty side or for anyone looking for any actual support from this type of top. It would definitely be fine to be a type of top to wear without a bra as an athlesiure style shirt for normal daily activity like shopping or running errands, but I would not try doing any work out activities in this.",
Rini Oliai,Great workout top with built in bra,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3N49P7RB8PN5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ3WX8FR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Burgundy,Verified Purchase,Very comfortable and supportive,

I was surprised at the quality and fabric material as they are super soft, perfect stretch, and still provide support. I got my typical size Medium, but it seems it may run a bit large. It fits fine, however for a sports bra I would like a more tighter fit / better sport, so I would definitely size down next time. The bra does come padded, and for the most part the pads stay in place but you can easily move them around and adjust to your fit.",

And I did, except for the fact that it didn’t fit. I should have probably sized up, but I have a dilemma when it comes to my sizing. I am small around the ribs, but large in the chest. I think my size is around a 32H or I style is great. Just needs a little more room in the bust.",
Laur,Good for small-chested,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R334MQ35FK52D7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJ3WX8FR,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 23, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Onyx,,"The feel of this tank is very nice. It's not a super soft fabric, but it's not too spandex-y feely either. I also love the color (onyx) so much; it's the perfect grey shade.  The bra part is the thing that knocks the tank down for me. The built-in bra part is pretty short, so the balance of making sure the band is under your boobs and the tank not being too low cut is a struggle AND I have really small boobs. I think it's good for casual wear or layering, definitely not for working out.",

Im 5'7"" and about 220 lbs. Typical bra is a 40C and most shirts are L-XL.  I got this in a medium. It is soooooo soft. The material is like buttah. In typical sport bra fashion a bit of cardio to get it on and off. But she is so suportive. I feel like Im getting the perfect hug. Nothing is uncomfortable. Nice long line so it is almost crop top like. I absolutely love this bra and will now order more from Lizzo's line of products. Hell yes girl and thank you!",

Though I don't have a very large chest, I definitely feel supported in this top. I believe I could do workouts of all levels in it while feeling like my breasts would would stay in place. I also really like the slate gray color and find it goes with many other pieces of activewear.",

The color is just as pictured. The material is super smooth and soft. It's tight enough that it holds everything together nicely, but is stretchy enough that it's comfortable to wear. I wouldn't recommend for larger chests for running as everything does bounce up and down quite a bit when I do jumps or jog.",
