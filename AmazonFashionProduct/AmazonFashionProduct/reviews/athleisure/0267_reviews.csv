Allison,The Perfect Blend of Comfort and Style,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37IUZMRHT1442/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B083NWZ85L,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"These pants are an absolute wardrobe staple! The lack of a cuff at the bottom gives them a polished look, making them easy to dress up for work or a night out, but they’re just as perfect for lounging or running errands. Fits true to size.  The stretchy, soft material makes them incredibly comfortable—I could wear them all day without any fuss. I love them so much that I now have them in multiple colors, and every pair fits like a dream.  If you’re looking for versatile pants that combine style and comfort, these are a must-have. Highly recommend grabbing more than one!",

The quality is comparable to other gym clothes. (My second choice)  The YYV brand has a unique style with a fake zipper flap, a small cut at the bottom of the legs, giving it a smart-casual look, and no elastic waistband. The fit around the waist is great and doesn’t restrict breathing, and the sizing is accurate. Petite friendly. (My first choice)  The CRZY Yoga brand has a tie-waist style like Ajisai. it’s not ideal for petite people as the length is too long and the waistband is too high. (My third choice)  Overall, all the pants are made of similar, stretchable material and can be styled as lounge wear, airport wear, or smart-casual outfits. Good pants for all seasons.",31

For reference, I'm 5'3.5"" I ordered 2 in petite large and they fit like a true 7/8 pant, that is they're above the ankle and show off your shoe! The regular large came to the top of my sneaker, not too long, not too short. I have an apple 🍎  shape.
