I pretty much got them for the pants and figured if the top worked too then I would consider it a bonus.  I do like the pants better as expected mainly because the top sizing is off. I ordered an XL set and it feels like the top is a L.  I am normally a L in tops which would be fine but with the mock neck it makes it feel a bit tight.  If it was sized as a true XL I think I would like it even better.  Overall though the look together is really pretty and classic.  The material is nice and thick and looks like it would cost a lot more.  As someone with long legs I also appreciate the generous length so they don't feel awkwardly cropped.  Overall happy with this selection!,

I'm short, though, so the pants hit right at the tops of my shoes, and I think that helps. I'm not sure the wide, slightly flared legs would look great as capris.  The fabric is THICK. That's a good thing (more on that below), but also means this isn't what I'd call summer wear by any stretch of the imagination. It's going to be a sweaty mess in minutes, especially being synthetic. It's definitely synthetic, and I'm picky about those, but this one is comfortable for me.  The construction looks solid - no dangling threads, misaligned seams, etc., that would raise red flags for me. The color (bright green) is exactly as it appears on my screen, but depending on your settings YMMV.  Now - this is thick enough to be real clothes if you want it to be. It's definitely a great choice for travel because it can be dressed up or down. As far as I'm concerned, if you play this right, you've got business casual that feels like pajamas. (Again, I'm short so the fact that these are full length pants helps here.) The waistband is the only real dead giveaway that this isn't an office casual set, so if you can manage to cover that up reliably, like with a good, wide belt, and add some dressier shoes and accessories - well, you can probably wear that to many office settings. I'm going to probably use a peplum cardigan and some nice flats because this fabric is going to be used more in the late fall/winter/early spring in my climate.  I would actually pay a little more to get this exact set in a more luxurious fabric, but it's outperforming its $33 price tag even in current form.",2
