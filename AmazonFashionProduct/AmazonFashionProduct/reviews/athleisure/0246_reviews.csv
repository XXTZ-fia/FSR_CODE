Theresa,JUST GET IT,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R65PN97OPSEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDCMZ51,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"If you’ve been thinking about getting this set. Just get it!!! It’s soft, stretchy & oh so comfortable!! It’s thicker than I thought it was gonna be. It’s not a regular legging material. I love that the shirt is slightly oversized. I sometimes wear it off the shoulder. It has a deep V neck style shirt. So it’s super flattering. Great to just throw on & can dress up or down!",6
Amazon Customer,"If you usually wear size S or M, GET A SMALL",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBAO2LIU4GSTP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDCMZ51,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 1, 2024",Color: PurpleSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"For reference: 5’7” 145lbs. Like the title says, get a small if your size runs between small and medium. The outfit is very cute, but quite oversized (at least in the purple tone). The shorts crotch is long and I have to roll the waist over a few times to get it to sit at my waist. I think if I scrunch up the shorts legs then it’ll hit at a good spot on my legs. The shirt is definitely oversized and I think you’ll still be able to achieve the baggy look in the size small. It’s just extra baggy in the medium. I can only speak for the purple color, but if you’re debating, get the small. The material is better than I expected, definitely not too thin and flowy to where it seems cheap, but not so thick. Other people have been saying it feels like nurse scrubs material, but I disagree. Feels like a good quality cotton. Not too stiff, not too thin.",7

Kassie,What is everyone else wearing?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMLVMWJG6FFYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMDCMZ51,"2.0 "," the United States "," June 19, 2024",Color: Dark GreySize: XX-Large,Verified Purchase,"I’m genuinely confused by the rating of these sets. I had to write a review because I feel like most people must have received an entirely different product than I did. I bought this set in 4 colors: dark gray, light gray, chocolate brown and black. All of which are extremely itchy, too warm and thick for hot weather and not soft or breathable in anyway.  I have wash and worn each set multiple times and wish I hadn’t bought so many. They are okay for what I paid for them but I genuinely would rather not own them at all. The fit is okay. I sized up because I have big hips and a big butt and wanted it to still be flowly on me. I will say if you have a wider waist and don’t like things digging in then size up because the elasticized waist can be a bit tighter in some of the colorways. I have a smaller waist so this isn’t really a big issue for me but I thought it was worth mentioning.  For reference I am usually a large on bottom and medium on top and bought the set in an xl. The shorts fit slightly loose (which I prefer because I hate when things dig in) and the top is like a very short dress and very loose. I am 5’8 and actually like the fit of the top. The neckline is very wide and I wear it off the shoulder with a longline sports bra underneath.  I live in Oklahoma and this fabric is miserable in anything about 80 degree weather. Material is very scratchy against the skin and something I am constantly aware of. I rip this set off as soon as I done running my errands and home. I definitely feel like I sweat a lot more in these sets than a normal summer two piece casual set.  They wash fine and don’t shrink for me in the dryer but I prefer them laid flat to dry. Color ways are true color from the stock photos and they are way too thick to be see through in anyway. They will wrinkle if you just leave them bunched up but nothing too crazy. Overall I don’t recommend, sorry.",38

The shirt is definitely an oversized fit - very cute, but you might pop out of the V-neck if you’re a restless sleeper. No issues for me with the waist of the shorts *but* the crotch is longer than the old school biking shorts I grew up wearing. That’s actually a plus in my book because *no* uncomfortable camel toe situation. The material wasn’t soft when first removed from package. It felt a little better after first washing, and either I have gotten used to it or it softened a bit after one night’s sleep. I sleep in a sports bra usually, so this will be perfect for rolling out of bed and going for an early morning walk or making the carpool run while the weather is still warm.
