I was originally looking for some with jersey material when I came across these. I would describe them as a cross between joggers and leggings and they are fantastic! The material is similar to leggings - stretchy and silky. Like the kind of material dog/cat hair doesn’t stick to (this is super important to me because we have four dogs and three cats). They have slight compression through the lower belly which is great since I’ve had 2 kids. They are PERFECT for going to kids sport events or the gym. They feel super durable, not see through at all despite the leggings-like fabric, and perfect weight material for any season (at least in Texas). For fit reference, I’m about 10 pounds heavier than I usually am right now and I’m fairly bottom-heavy. Right now, I wear medium in leggings, 10-12 in jeans, and medium T-shirts. Since these are joggers, I wanted a looser fit so I got a Large… as you can see by the pics they are NOT loose. I would definitely say they are more snug than expected but I actually love them. I rarely go by the size charts since my measurements always put me in between sizes, but in this case, I think the size chart would probably have been pretty accurate and with my current weight & measurements, and XL would have given me the fit I thought I was looking for. But once I lose this extra 10-15 pounds from the holidays they’ll be perfect. I’m 5’5”, 180 pounds. Measurements are bust: 40” (36 DD), waist 33”, hips 45”.",44
