The material is light, but substantial and doesn't appear that it will rip or tear easily. The color is vibrant and not faded or ""off"". The front comes to just below my belly button and the v in the back is in the perfect spot, not being too low. With this type of material and the cutout design, it definitely promotes airflow in the best way. It has a lot of stretch for movement, but isn't too clingy nor baggy. It hits all the right spots and the size fits as expected.",

It is short enough it still gives a modern look, but is actually flattering.  I pair it with high-waisted leggings or bike shorts, which works perfectly.The material is comfortable, lightweight, and silky.  The back scoop and cutout details are cute without being too revealing.  It does show a little bit of bra strap though which is a personal pet peeve.  The red color is true to the pics and very vibrant.  I like that the shirt isn't too clingy and skims over the tummy.  Also, it is true to size.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this top, especially as a cute workout/lounge option.",
