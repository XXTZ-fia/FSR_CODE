The fabric is great at wicking away sweat, so I stay dry and comfortable during my exercises. Plus, it looks cute enough to wear even outside of the gym. I'm really happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great workout tank!",

Very cute workout tank with a perfect length and racerback. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because they wrinkle really easy!!!!,3

I washed it to get the stain out but it’s still there. I wouldn’t mind if it wasn’t front and center.",
Lysa Slater,These shirts are gems!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ELIS0FEX2IE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C2GX4V1M,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 7, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,I love these little tops. I'm 61 so I don't want too much of a crop but these hit at the top of my shorts. So in the perfect spot. They are super soft and very airy and cool in the Florida heat. They are super lightweight but don't feel cheap or flimsy. I wear these daily for 6 months of the year and just can't say enough good about them.,2

I loved this so much I purchased 3. One in every color. I do wear a sports bra underneath and so, the M fit perfect. At 5'  petite medium size the large was just too large in the arm holes",
Melissa D M,Love this top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3806DAY3P4OYB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C2GX4V1M,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Light Heather Gray,Verified Purchase,"I am 5'3"" and have fairly wide shoulders. I wear a 34 A-B depending on the bra. So many tops are too long for me but this is perfect. It is a good weight and flairs out a bit at the bottom, enough to not highlight areas I prefer not to be higlighted. After buying the first one, I bought a few more colors.",
Deb W,White is very different from other colors,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LV4OOAH7QOM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C2GX4V1M,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 19, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"I originally purchased this in grey and just loved the cut and fabric so I went back and ordered in black and white too. The black is now my favorite but the white is going back. The fabric is thinner than the colors and does not lay as nicely. If I had only ordered white I never would have ordered the other colors. Again, I love the other colors and would not hesitate to buy them again, but the white is a like a completely different item. My advice is to buy this brand in another color.",2

lookin_08902,Shows sweat stains too much,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PL8GQDD97PO8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C2GX4V1M,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 8, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Deep Heather Gray,Verified Purchase,"I love the softness of the material but it absorbs sweat which changes the color of the material (around the neck and arm pits) which looks gross, then when it dries, it leaves a stain at the edges of the sweat line!  I guess it'll be a good summer top for non-sports activities if you don't sweat. Unfortunately I've used it or i would return it.",
Paula Filius,My favorite tank,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NDGP6PJVPL92/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C2GX4V1M,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 7, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Red,Verified Purchase,"Fits perfectly, good material, flattering.  I am 4ft 10in and it's hard to find a top that sits right on my hips or waist.  Usually everything is much too long.  I got 3 of these in different colors and need many more.  I've worn them all summer long and will wear them again next year and I'll also get more colors.",

I am 5'4"", 132 Lbs, 68 yrs old. I have scoliosis of the spine so my tops are always a challenge to lay properly on my back. This top does it - it is not clingy, tight and the fabric is breathable. It is the perfect length for my height. I am between a petite and a regular and find that this top does not dwarf me and is the right length - it provides a nice modern but not too revealing look. Launders nicely. Great top, good price!",7

So many are either ridiculously long or so clingy they accentuate all the bulges you'd prefer to hide.  I must've tried over 2 dozen tanks and sleeveless shirts and returned them all.But finally I found this one and it fits the bill.  Being made of rayon, the material feels very cool to the touch.  It's a slightly heavier weight and drapes appealingly.  It is shapely while hiding all the things you want hidden.  The neckline and arm openings sit high so there's no accidental reveal when you bend over and move around.  Price is right too.Only minor downside is that it doesn't wick and isn't as lightweight as I prefer for my workout clothes.  But as I mentioned, the heavier weight allows it to drape more flatteringly.  And I knew it didn't wick when I bought it.",2
