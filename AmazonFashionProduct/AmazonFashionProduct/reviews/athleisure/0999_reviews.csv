They were so wrinkled. I bought grey, pink & white. The white looks yellowed with age. The shorts part is like a parachute material (if you're old enough to remember parachute pants!) The ""compression"" shorts underneath ride up. I was constantly pulling them down. I'd like to return them but I already wore the pink. I probably won't ever wear the age-colored white. They'll most likely end up in the bottom of the pile of my workout clothes & get tossed someday with the tags still on them.",
