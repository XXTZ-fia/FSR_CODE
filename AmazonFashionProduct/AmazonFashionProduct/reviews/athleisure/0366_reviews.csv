As far as the material goes, the front panel is thick but the rest of it is light. It’s not soft but it’s not itchy either. It’s just solid material (except for the fraying where it’s cropped).

It’s  cute to go out workout or lounge in. I reallyd hope the worn string design doesn’t spoil the jacket over time it’s a cute touch but the strings actually do pull apart the actual sweater it’s not just a faux worn design look. So I’d be very gentle with washing and drying this jacket.,6

The zipper works great and the collar part looks fab. I love the pale color, it looks simple but cute. And it easily matches most outfits. It looks great with leggings and a tank top underneath. Cool look!  Size-wise, it fits true to size. I ordered one size up to get that oversized look and it’s perfect.",2
