Wallachick,Perfect For White Racerback Tops,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QVAMA8PKN5MR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08W152MPL,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 28, 2022",,Verified Purchase,"Truth be told, white tops are see through most of the time. And with white racerback tank tops with a great silhouette, one needs a beige raceback sports bra. It’s almost imporssible to find. I am so glad I found this one. I ordered a medium and it’s nice and snug but not tight. The padding is also nice and not some strange shape or thickness. If you want to wear a white racerback, this is absolutely perfect!",

Allie L,Less supportive but not a dealbreaker,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20QW7ODNMX63Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08W152MPL,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 7, 2024",Color: Ditsy Floral MultiSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"Like other reviews have said, this is a bit less supportive than other tops/bras like it. But the print is cute and I’m small enough (34B) that I don’t need a ton of support to begin with, so I decided to keep it. Was definitely supportive enough for pickleball, but I wouldn’t take it running. It does run a little big (I normally wear a medium in items like it, but I got a small).",

It's not intended for high impact or event medium or low impact workouts that might require you to bend over at all. Almost more so an athleisure top with a built in ""bra"" for just hanging about. So, it's cute but I wouldn't order again.",

For me personally I wish it was a little bit longer because it sits above my waist line and I find myself tugging on it two make it feel more comfortable. I mostly wear it with a pair of overalls that I am. It makes for a cute combination with overalls,2
