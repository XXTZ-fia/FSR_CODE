The material is soft and substantial, but not so thick I'll sweat and pass out with heat exhaustion from a hot flash (also in that era, I'm afraid.) The stripes woven into the fabric add textured stripes that are very forgiving for any, how shall I put it? Tushy dimples. I'm a size 10 petite and the medium fit perfectly, not too baggy not too tight and, most importantly, not too long. The pockets are large and neither the neckline nor the cuffs are constricting. They are well made and, honestly, I can't find anything wrong with them (and I looked!)  They look just like the photos --I was a bit concerned since there were no photos of the set from behind butt they fit back there just fine (see what I did there?) Mom jokes aside: these are a great set at a good price!",5

I'm 5'6 so finding outfits in small, where the legs go all the way down to the ankle, not my midcalf, is a challenge. But these pants fit beautifully. The stitching line on the top right shoulder is a bit weird but I think it's suppose to come like that? After washing and drying, it didn't snag, shrink or pill.
