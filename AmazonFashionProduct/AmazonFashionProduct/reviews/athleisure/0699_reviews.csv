The thought of working out or sweating in this soft lightweight silk-like material would be unbearable. Rather, call it a casual pant suit to be worn together or as classic separates. True to size with a flattering shape (thanks to no pockets and fitted minimalist piping) it certainly makes a statement while remaining fashionably comfortable. I like the zipper top (they say ¼ length, it’s closer to ½ for me), ready to layer it with a lacy camisole or colorful brassiere underneath and then a light turtleneck later in the season.  My one complaint was the pant length: too short & I’m not wild about cuffs. Thankfully, I found a finished hem was underneath the cuff. So I snipped the fold away and gained 2 inches in length. Now the suit fits perfectly with all types and heights of shoes. Love it much, I have another one on order.",10

Customer Review,So so soft,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R320GT7Y81C4RP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJNGB7DC,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 7, 2024",Color: Rose PinkSize: Large,,"This outfit is awesome. It’s so incredibly soft and comfortable to wear. It’s also lightweight, which surprised me because I thought it would be like a thick sweatsuit but it’s not (material is 45% Rayon 48% Polyester 7% Spandex), which is good because I live in Florida and I’ll have more chances to wear this. I am 5’9” and around 150 lbs and ordered a large, as I always size up in outerwear, and this fits great but I would have been fine with a medium. Overall I think this is a great outfit for fall/winter. Highly recommend!",2
