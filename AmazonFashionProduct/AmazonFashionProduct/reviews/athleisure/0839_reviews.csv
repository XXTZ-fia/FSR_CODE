Occasionally.  The fabric is a really nice quality fleece, you can definitely tell it's a polyester blend but it's still soft and comfy, and the side that's next to the skin is very fuzzy.  It fits true to the size chart (please pardon my very dusty mirror), I'm 5'3"" 150lbs and went with a Large to make sure I had lots of extra room because I have 40"" hips and didn't want to risk the pants not being as loose as I like, but a Medium would have worked too, just wouldn't have been quite as baggy.  There are only two things about this set that I wish were different.  First is, there's a decorative seam that runs the entire length of the pants both front and back. It doesn't really do anything but look nice on the front so it's fine, but on the back it rubs a little annoyingly whenever I sit down or lean against anything.  Second is, this is a pretty thick fabric and the hood is two layers of that thick fabric, so it gets pretty bulky around the neck and shoulders when it's worn with the hood down.  Neither of these things is likely to keep me from spending about 40% of the winter in this set. But they are things to be aware of before you order.",19

It’s somehow lightweight but incredibly warm without making you sweat at the same time. The material is SO soft and the color is gorgeous (and matches the picture exactly, at least in terms of the green). I ordered this in a small and width/girth size it’s bigger than I was expecting, but length wise it’s borderline too short on both items. I’m roughly 5’9, so there is absolutely no excess or bunched up material around the ankles like in the picture. The hoodie is also shorter torso wise than I like (it’s almost showing my stomach) and the sleeves are almost too short. So if you’re someone that prefers a baggier sweatshirt and sweatpants I’d suggest going up a size. If not, stick with your normal size.",

But that's not the problem, the main problem is the huge thick seam across the middle which is weird and uncomfortable. The pockets are way too high, they come right below your breasts so nobody wants to put their hands way up there. The pants are also have a strange fat seam, but it's not too uncomfortable.",

I sized up, even though I know it would have still looked over-sized if I got a Small. I went with a Medium, and I am happy with how well it fits. The bottoms elastic waistband is not too tight, making the baggy sweatpants comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I often get size Medium bottoms, but I can tell the small would have still fit comfortably (size 4 typically). They stay on securely. The sweater as well gives room around the collar and has a very large hood! The hoodie sweater and the sweat pants both have a line through them that is discreet but adds a unique touch. The material of the set is nice and thick and the inside fuzzy! Not a bad price. It isn't the MOST buttery soft set out there as far as the external material goes, but it is durable and satisfying to feel. I really like the shade of grayish blue, and think it can be dressed up to look more expensive than it is. Definitely cozy, while also giving classy vibes that can easily fancify any errands day or gym visit!",3

The stitching is really well done! There is some design stitching down the pants that makes it more unique. Looks and feels comparable to known brands. The beige is a nice neutral color and looks exactly as pictured. The top is more of a cropped style instead of a full length. I absolutely love it. Great set for the fall!,

This is an excellent quality sweatsuit set! Sometimes photos are deceiving but this is exactly as it looks in the photos and feels amazing! This set is just like those ultra popular ones that you see all over social media. Or better.  As soon as I felt this, I was in love. It is nice and thick, soft on the outside, but super soft and warm on the inside! This is an excellent fall and winter set. The price is 100% justified, it is so worth it. I'd say on size, size up one. This is intended to look a little baggy as opposed to super fitted. Like oversized. I'm usually small and I got medium, so glad I did. The top seems a bit cropped and I think small would be too small and fitted for the oversized look we want. This would make an excellent gift, and I plan on purchasing a set for my sister. And more colors for myself! The brown is beautiful and I want a set in every color! I cannot tell you how good this is.",3

The material is 50 cotton 50 poly so it's super soft.  I always check the waistband size on the chart and make sure I get the size sweatpants I want even if the hoodie might be too big.  (Nothing worse than the waistband being too tight).  This set is great for running errands or wearing to the airport.  Highly recommend!",

I'm in the middle of a weight loss journey so I ordered it a size larger than I could have, but I like my sweat suits baggy.

This outfit’s a touch too warm for Florida summers, but it’s so soft and cozy that I just can’t wait to wear it. It’s nice and roomy, too, and there are deep and functional pockets on both the pants and the hoody.  I think it looks great, too, and the fit is exactly as expected. I do find the inseam runs a little low, allowing my thighs to touch, which isn’t my favorite feeling. It’s fine with shorts, though. My only other complaint would be the pointy style of the hood - I prefer the rounded look - but that’s a matter of personal preference.  On the whole, I absolutely love this outfit and I can’t wait to wear it and eat junk food for about 3 straight days in winter.",15
