Was expecting us to be blush pink but it’s definitely pretty dark. The overall fit though fits very well so I’m going to try to make it work since I ordered these for a photo shoot. The leggings are a little long however I am 5’3” with a 28” inseam. I don’t mind since I’ll be using us for yoga but if you mind they are pretty long. I was actually quite surprised with how much the garment stretched because when I removed it out of the packaging I thought it was too small but it fits perfect! Wish the color matched but so far I love the fit. As far as squirrel proof this color is a squat proof I can’t say the same for the other colors. Only 4 stars cuz color is way off.,19
