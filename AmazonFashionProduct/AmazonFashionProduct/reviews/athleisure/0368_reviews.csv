Oxymoron_Deli,"Very Comfy, Be Sure to Size Up",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2V0VUQ75DPL3D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7V7WTDZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 9, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Brown,,"Overall, I'm very impressed with this tracksuit/sweatsuit set. (TL;DR)  The set was delivered in a vacuumed-sealed plastic--reminds me of the ziploc bags that have the air vacuumed out--that is resealable. The clothes did not have that off putting smell that often comes with buying clothes via Amazon; only a slight plasticy smell from the bag. As for the set itself, it is comfy and warm without being too heavy. The fleece on the inside is very thin, so I doubt it will do well for ""warmth"" in freezing temps; however, I'm in the US southeast and it's perfect for my needs. The set held up during a cold, gentle wash cycle and hang dry. The fabric dried overnight; even the cuffs around the wrists and bottom hem of the top dried fairly quickly. The large fit is slightly baggy on me (measurements below). Before getting into the details, my overall first impression is that this is an excellent set that is worth the $45 price tag. I would suggest going up a size for that ""roomy"" feel.  --Excessively Detailed Review Notes Below--  My measurements are: 5', 145 lbs, 39' bust, 32"" waist, 40"" hip, and 26"" inseam (short and stout), and I requested size large primarily for a roomy waistband and higher rise. The large pant's measures: 10.5"" front rise and 16"" seat from crotch (sorry, can't find a better word) to the top of the waistband, 34"" waistband, 27"" inseam, and 45.5"" hip. The large top's measures: 24"" from shoulder to bottom hem, 43"" bust (this measurement was a struggle to get correct with the sleeves), a 41"" bottom hem, and 57"" arm span.  Detailed Set Fit: The set fits decently. I sized up for the comfier fit, but I feel as though the sizing runs smaller in some areas than the size chart indicates. The manufacturer advices to give or take an inch, but some parts were more like 2 inches different but that could be due to the fleece lining. There is a bit of pooling at the pant cuff, but that's expected for me. The arm span fits me almost perfectly (about an 1""-1.5"" over ""perfect""), which could lean the top''s arms towards being too short for taller/longer-armed folks. There is minimal shoulder constraint, so I can reach up and across easily but there is slight shoulder compression.  Nurospicy person note: this top does not have a dropped shoulder that allows for more freedom of movement, the slouchy look in the photos appears to be from sizing up rather than the designed. The photos in which the model has their elbows pointing out (looks like the 3rd image for the colors Navy Blue, Brown, and Khaki, and the fourth image for the Red one) shows the pulling/compression on the top of the shoulders. The semi-ish-bat wing keeps the sleeve from compressing the bottom part of the arm or cutting into the armpit. I also noticed that the fleece lining clings to cotton underclothes like underwear and t-shirts, and those spots feel slightly sung. Even though the measurements indicate the piece should be loose, the clinging creates the feeling of snugness. That cling bugs me when I'm overstimulated, but I realize some folks like or don't mind that feeling.",7
RD,Love this set!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30WM9O06355T8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7V7WTDZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 10, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Light Grey,,"Wash it before you put it on; it irritated my skin, especially the inner thighs, until I washed it. Now it's my favorite set. The pants are a little short (I feel like that's visible even in the photos, now that I know to look)  and the inner thighs started pilling almost immediately, which is why it has 4 stars instead of 5. The color is great and it's large-chest friendly. The torso is a good length and the collar is very cute, actually. I love the whole set.",

The fabric is thicker and warmer for cold nights. Personally I would not wear them traveling since they look and feel like pajamas to me. Maybe for a walk or workout, but not as flexible as I would like for work out clothes. The top is casual, I’d wear it out with jeans to go out and about. My typical medium in The pants and top fit perfectly. The pants elastic waist band is comfortable. I’m 5’ 4” and between an 8 and 10. The thumb holes on the top are placed right and are big enough. The top fits without being baggy nor tight. However, it does not have any stretch to the fabric so feels tight in the arms when I reach forward.",
The New Achilles,Versatile and more flattering than you would think,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12RA8ELOVT4Z3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7V7WTDZ,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 24, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"My wife typically wears a small but got this set in medium because she wanted the extra length (she is 5'8.5"")  and loose fit. She can wear it long with Uggs, but find this looks better scrunched up on the calf. Although it's loose, it's actually a flattering look because the waist is more fitted and the top has a boxy cut that matches well. The inside fabric is soft and more fleece like than the outside, which has a more durable feel. This is great to throw to run errands in the cooler weather, especially if you need to stop at the gym while you're out.",

The raglan sleeves are stylish and comfortable -- love them for ease of movement. The ribbed cuffs have thumbholes -- a blessing if you have cold hands. Love the funnel neck -- when it's zipped up, so warm and cozy, but you can zip it down for ventilation if you get too hot and then you have a nice collar. The kangaroo pocket has a flattering cut. The fabric is substantial and is brushed inside for a fleecy finish. The pants are kind of meh in comparison -- they are basic sweatpants with pockets, and they are pretty long, so they look bulky and baggy. Not stylish, like the top. I wish the cut wasn't so full. I wouldn't wear this ensemble on a plane because it looks too casual for my taste -- the pants I'd wear only around the house or on my way to the gym. The top, however, would make a good travel piece with nicer pants because of the comfortable cut of the armholes and the versatile neckline that looks equally good zipped up for cozy warmth or zipped down for ventilation.",2

Here's my quick thoughts:  advantages:  material is soft and kinda cozy, feels warm on cooler days. love the little details like thumb holes, make it good for jogging or just relaxing. the pants got pockets, which is super handy when you don't wanna carry bag all the time. top fits nicely with the half-zip, good for those quick temperature changes. cons:  the size is little confusing, I ordered medium but it felt shorter on legs. after 2 washes, fleece looks bit less fluffy, like it lose some of it's softness. pants string keep twisting inside waistband, little bit annoying. Overall, its not bad set. Good choice if you want comfy and casual for travel or lounging. I wear it a lot but not for very long flights, still, kinda recommend!",
