Pdxmama,Good material. Fits as expected.

I'm 5'4"" 124lbs with no tone- so pudgy and in the early works of making fitness my routine. Its comfortable, soft. And breathable. Got a medium after seeing others say it ran small, I also wear 32ff bra so thought medium would compensate for the larger ladies. I have to say. I COULD have gotten away with a small easily. This is almost too long but I DO have a short torso, and the straps dont fit to my shoulders as snugly without pulling too down to expose more the cleavage as I'd like for public use. Will be GREAT for home use, but I think I will order a small for classes and public spaces. Also, the white is very opaque. Not just a little. A small in white would be worse, so I'll order probably order a black. Will look more flattering when I tone up, but I didn't buy this to look sexy so.it does the job.  I'm more surprised this fit so large on me after all the reviews of it fitting small. Did not expect that.",19

GOTS certified fiber reactive dyes are what you want. GOTS prohibits these chemicals.  I am thankful to find these and the seller is very friendly and accommodating.

They seriously need to consider repositioning their words. I sent it back, because it looked stupid and made me feel self conscious. I'm small chested, so I don't' know if it would fit everybody this way or not, but I didn't like it. I would never pin a corsage across my nipple! I would pin it up a bit higher. Name tags? Same thing. I'm just not comfortable with the placement of the words. Just make a quality shirt and leave my breasts alone.  Updated review: Wow! I don't know what to think. This company evidently reads the reviews and cares what customers think. I did not write to the company, because I simply returned the item through Amazon, but... in response to my review, the company e-mailed me (through Amazon) the following:  ""We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience regarding your order and would like to offer you a full refund for your purchase. If you would like a full refund: please reply 'Full refund'. We hope that you give us another chance. Thank you very much. Best regards, TREELANCE Please note – sellers are not allowed to ask for a customer’s personal information including email or phone number: and you are not expected to change your review due to this outreach or any potential resolution.""  I won't, of course, ask for a refund, since Amazon already did that for me, but as it's becoming increasingly more difficult for customers to receive respect, I felt obligated to let everybody know that this company went out of their way to contact me. I am raising my 1 star review to 3. I still wouldn't want words across my breast, but customer service means a lot to me. I may not have liked this particular shirt, but I will most definitely be checking out their other products, because I'd love to do business with a company that wants happy customers. I would suspect that a company that reads reviews might also be using that feedback to improve or create products that customers want or need. I felt like I'd been heard, even though I hadn't contacted them. :-) So, 1 star for this particular product and 5 stars for customer service.",5

I’m returning it.  ***Update - I returned the white tank top and got a black one in a size Large. The large fits me better than the medium, but it’s very long on me. Because it’s so long, the moon phase print on the back bunches up and looks more like a spine print on my back versus the moon phases. I will admit that I am short and my body is just stupid so this tank top isn’t going to look on me the way the way it looks on the model. The black is not see through at least. Perhaps this tank will shrink a little in the wash. I still like this tank top despite the length.",2

I used to wear black ALL the time, especially in outdoor gear and gym clothes, but now I prefer charcoal gray or other dark heather-ed colors. A lot of that is just because pure black often doesn't age well. It shows dirt, lint and pilling, so especially for wearing to the gym, etc., I'd rather have something else. Also, it's hot in the sun! I don't like slogans or sayings on my clothes either, but I do love the moons. Overall, I'm happy to have found an organic cotton tank at this price.",

It may be a bit too stretchy, but I can live with it.  It is a little tight, so I'm glad I got the large.  A lot of my tanks are medium, but I've gained a little weight during the pandemic, so I went for the large.  It's still a bit tight, so when I washed it, I did not put it in the dryer, but hung it to dry instead.  It was a bit pricey, so I'm still looking around.

I'm a size 12-14, and ordered the 3xxx (!!!) which fit perfectly, except, the patterns of moon phases started halfway down my back, and so many simply disappeared down my bottom past the point of visibility-- and some got hidden in a fold of fat or two-- so the moon phase pattern looked kind of awful on me, with a few hidden phases.  Which was too bad, because the fabric and fit were otherwise divine.  So, sadly, I sent it back.  Still, it's a great top; I hope it works out better for you in your size.",

The best part, of course, is that they are made from organic cotton, and yet are very fairly priced for such a high-quality product.  I wear these every single day now that I am at home quarantining, so they are getting washed more often than most of my older tanks.  The previous tanks that I have owned start to look worn out and get misshapen after numerous washings, but not these.  Whether you buy these for yoga classes or yoga at home, you will not be disappointed.  Highly recommend!",

I suggest you order a size larger than usual. What earned this tank a 5 star rating was the customer support from Karina, the shop owner. I appreciated the offer to replace (when I left a poor rating originally) and this personalized reach out was the catalyst for an improved rating. Measure yourself and order with confidence. The shirt is supposed to fit snug. The graphic is adorable.",

I tried to find the perfect tank top for my Crossfit workouts - one that wouldn't be too tight but that would not ride up or fall around my my head when I am in a handstand.  The ones with the moons on the back are a little imperfect - the moons don't line up perfectly with the center of the tank, so they don't line up exactly on my spine.  It doesn't bother me, but it is notable.  They are best in black.",
