Dacia,"I'm in love with these - don't know why, I just am",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R1PZ3NUO4JV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS6YWRQ5,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Chocolate Brown,,"Alright, buckle up, buttercups, because we're about to dive deep into the world of these chocolate-brown, side-zippered marvels I've recently acquired. I’m talking about sweat shorts, people. But not just any sweat shorts. These are elite. They’re the kind of sweat shorts that make you question all your previous life choices that didn’t involve owning them.  First off, let’s address the color: Chocolate Brown. Now, I'm no fashion guru, but I’m pretty sure this shade is what happens when you leave a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup out in the sun for a week. It’s… well, it’s brown. And it's brown in a way that says, ""I'm comfy, but I'm also giving you a solid, earthy vibe."" I’m pretty sure I could blend in perfectly with a pile of discarded cardboard now. My husband says I look like a very confused UPS driver on laundry day.  Now, the high waist. Bless. Whoever invented high-waisted anything deserves a statue. It's like a comfy hug for your midsection. It keeps everything tucked in nicely, which is especially helpful when you're attempting to retrieve that rogue french fry from under the couch cushion. (Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about). The elastic waistband is also very welcoming after a particularly aggressive pizza binge. It's basically saying, ""Come on in! We got room for seconds… and thirds.""  But the pièce de résistance? The magnificent, nay, legendary side zippers that run the entire length of the shorts. WHY? I have no idea. Are they supposed to make me look like a futuristic track star? Will they allow me to rapidly change from comfy lounge lizard to Olympic athlete at a moment's notice? Probably not. But they’re there. And they make me feel like a secret agent. I’ve definitely considered running around my house yelling “ZIPPER POWER!” while dramatically zipping and unzipping them. My neighbors probably think I’m losing it, but frankly, the shorts are worth the judgment.  The fabric blend, 65% polyester and 35% cotton, is like the Goldilocks of the fabric world. Not too hot, not too cold, just… right. They're soft enough to lounge in while watching cat videos, but sturdy enough to handle the occasional emergency grocery run. And the pockets! Oh, the pockets! They're big enough to hold my phone, my keys, a travel-sized bottle of hand sanitizer, and a small collection of questionable snacks I'm refusing to share.  These “athleisure” shorts? They’re less “ath” and more “leisure.” I mean, I could maybe do some light yoga in them, but honestly, I’m more likely to perfect my horizontal nap technique. And you know what? I’m completely okay with that.  So, if you're looking for a pair of shorts that are comfortable, inexplicably cool, and just a little bit ridiculous, these chocolate-brown, fully-zippered wonders are for you. Just be prepared for the inevitable questions about those zippers. Your answer can be anything you want. I personally like to say I'm a low-key superhero with an affinity for comfy browns. Go forth and unzip your heart out!",
Janet88971Hollissen,"It's too roomy, too big and I don't like the zipper",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IZNYDCDQFTKD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS6YWRQ5,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Ivory White,,"These run big - they are comfortable around the waist but billow out a bit too much in the legs - if you have heavy thighs, they'll be a good fit, but I have 'normal' sized thighs and it's just a little too roomy for me - also the zipper is weird - what is it meant to do? If you unzip it, you'll expose most of your upper thigh and groin.  In the description, it says: ""The side zipper gives more possibilities for styling. You could make the cotton sweat shorts women high waisted more roomy if you unzip a little bit."" So, again, these would be best for women with an hourglass figure, not someone with very little difference in inches between the waist and hips, which applies to me.  The photos do show the shorts as they appear, so this is largely my fault for not paying enough attention - I just wish I would have gotten a size Small instead because I like shorts with a closer fit. They are soft and feel sturdy.",
Greg R,Comfortable and Practical Summer Shorts for Everyday Wear,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15TML5XT2963T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS6YWRQ5,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Porpoise,,"I received the luvamia sweat shorts for women in medium size, and my wife tried them out. She found the high-waisted design and elastic waistband to be comfortable and easy to wear. The fabric is soft and breathable, which works well for warm weather. The 4-inch inseam and wide-leg design provide a relaxed fit that pairs nicely with casual tops. The side zipper and pockets are functional and practical, adding some convenience. She wore them around the house and on casual outings, and they worked fine for both. The medium size fit as expected, based on the size chart. While they aren’t particularly unique, they’re a decent choice for casual summer wear. Overall, they’re good for anyone looking for simple and comfortable shorts.",
Customer Review,so fun!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZEANXTG5DMIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS6YWRQ5,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"I love these shorts!  They're just cute and they are something different with the zipper on the sides.  The material is so soft and so comfortable to wear (fabric is 65% Polyester, 35% Cotton) and they look really cute on.  As for fit, I usually wear a medium (size 6-8) but I got these in a large because I don't like when elastic waistbands are too tight and these fit perfectly.  I think the mediums would have been too tight.  If you're looking for a cute pair of lounge shorts then I would say go for it!",
Lisa Ahlstedt,So comfy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F45RIJDN6W9J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS6YWRQ5,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Light Heather Grey,,"These shorts are very soft and comfortable. The material is not at all stretchy, but the elastic waistband makes the shorts easy to pull on. The two pockets on the sides are not very deep but the stitching on the front blends in very well with the rest of the fabric. The fit is as expected and not tight at all. The zippers up the legs are unusual, but they don't seem to be in any danger of unzipping unexpectedly (still, might want to check the zippers from time to time to make sure you're not exposing more leg than you intended to!). Very comfy for summer!",
Reading In Pajamas,I didn’t like these,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LBOPWPQYPYLL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS6YWRQ5,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,,I didn’t like how these fit or the look of these. I wouldn’t recommend them,
Lucinda Reed,Baggy and sloppy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I5XK51BUADQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS6YWRQ5,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"These shorts could of been really cute if the company had made an effort to have them look more fitted and tailored. The idea of using two side zippers as trim is awesome. I am 5’5”, 160lbs, 40C bust, 38” waist. I chose the Large size in black. The black color is a nice deep black. The fabric is not like sweatpants. There is a little stretch to the fabric, but it feels coarse and stiff. The shorts are too big because their measurement chart is from measurements taken when the shorts are in a relaxed state. When you stretch out the waist it measures 44"" and the hips measure 48"". This kind of miss information is frustrating. Save your money and don't bother.",
Pattep,Good summer shorts for full-figured women (or those who like them loose),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D2DRJPENH6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS6YWRQ5,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Chocolate Brown,,These are well constructed knit shorts and they have a nice wide elastic waist band which is quite comfortable.  The hips & leg area is very roomy.  No tight sweaty shorts here.  The zipper sides on the shorts are a bit of design overkill....I really don't get them and could have done without the zipper.  The leg opening are so large that ventilation by unzipping is not really needed. There will make great work shorts but I don't expect to make a fashion statement with them.,
Mome Rath,Unusual but comfy sweat shorts,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD6RIRXF9U82L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS6YWRQ5,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"These sweat shorts are made of the average, thick sweatshirt/pants material.  They are quite generously sized in the rear and legs with plenty of room in the opening for thighs.  I ordered a large and they seemed a little loose.  The zippers are very distracting!  I planned on using these for workout shorts, but may have to think otherwise, due to the jangling from the zipper heads each time I move.  Otherwise, they are soft and comfortable but they may not be practical for any sports activity.",
Juli,Interesting Shorts,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R43F17NFCD3UZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DS6YWRQ5,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Porpoise,,"For reference, I’m 5'2"" and 144 lbs, and I ordered a Medium, which fits just right. The material is really comfortable, kind of a towel/sweatpants texture, which feels soft but still sturdy.  The high-waisted design is flattering, and I love that these shorts have pockets for extra convenience. The side zipper is an interesting touch—I'm still getting used to it, but it adds a unique style. I did notice that the zipper part can feel a bit cold on my legs since there's no material covering the inside of it, but it’s not a huge issue.  What I really like about these shorts is that they strike a good balance between being lightweight and thick, which makes them perfect for both lounging and exercise. They’re breathable enough for the warmer months but still offer some structure, making them a great athleisure option.",

However, these luvamia sweat shorts look just as pictured, are comfortable , and fit nicely. The inside finish of the fabric is French terry while the outside is a smooth, classic sweat material. They are lightweight despite how thick they are and breathable which is perfect for lounging, workouts, and warmer weather. The zippers on the side are a subtle but cute/sporty feature. I'm happy with this purchase and I know I'll get lots of use out of them.",
