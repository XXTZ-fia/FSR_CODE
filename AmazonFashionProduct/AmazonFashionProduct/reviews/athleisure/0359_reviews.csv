It’s nice and stretchy and gives a snatching effect around the waist. The black is a perfect neutral closer peice and will be a piece I reach for all the time. I did already wash it, and it washes just fine. I also ordered the sky color and it is a true sky/pastel blue color. In the ad I also thought it might be more of a periwinkle color but there is not purple tones in it. The sky romper does seem to be a little tighter fitting but the medium is still definitely the correct size for me. Neither the black or the sky are see through both seem nice quality.

I wanted to love this!! First off, I like the way the bodice fits - I don’t need a bra and is enough support to just run errands or lounge in (I would NOT workout in this). The back criss-cross is cute too.  The worst part for me is the waist band. I’m only 5’2 so I have a short torso. I wish it sat more around the natural waist, but instead sits lower at the top my hips. It’s not flattering. As others have said, it’s bunches/rides up too and the keyhole cutout kind of gets lost. I kept having to pull it down. The shorts are also too big/loose. It’s just a weird fit overall. I wish there was an XS option. For 40 bucks, this isn’t it.",
