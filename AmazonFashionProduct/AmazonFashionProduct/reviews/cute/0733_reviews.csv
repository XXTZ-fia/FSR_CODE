Soft, comfy, true to size. I am never able to get shirts that fit my body because I have big boobs but don’t want to show too much cleavage. Surprisingly, these shirts were perfect amount of coverage and showed skin without it being too much. I started with just Orange and Dark green colors because the reviews were so positive so I trusted getting two. Afterwards I ordered 3 more! The top going left to right are: Dark green, Army Green Bottom left to right: Dark blue, Red, Caramel These colors are very true to the pictures, not dimming at all from how they actually look. I will be returning Army green though, I thought it would look more ‘green’ but it’s really light-dependent and more of a brown-swampy green. Not what I was looking for. Dark green on the contrary is a good Green/Teal in some lights and is what I am wearing in the mirror picture.  I am 5’3 160lbs and I ordered a large. Sleeves we’re perfect length, long enough to cover my stomach but I tucked the shirt into my pants, and the material very soft and not cinching or too tight but also stayed fit on my body. This is the first time I trusted reviews enough to get two shirts without knowing the quality and it did not disappoint. Hope this can help someone else into finding this amazing shirt!",24
