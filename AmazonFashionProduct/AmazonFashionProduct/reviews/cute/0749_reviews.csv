Lauren Kimberly,I suspect it was used,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VYSH8UOAU1JV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D73RYJNR,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Color: CoffeeSize: Small,Verified Purchase,This is a decent sweater. I don’t think the quality is as high as I expected. But the major issue is that mine came NIB but had piling under the arms and smelled of perfume. I suspect I received something worn and returned. I’m petite (5’1 and 118) and it also doesn’t fit as large as others reviewed. I wonder if it had also been washed/dried (I would only ever hang dry a sweater like this). I like the sweater but I’ll be returning and possibly repurchasing.,

I ordered one size larger, Yes I wanted an off the shoulder oversized sweater-  plus reading the reviews, seemed like it ran small. I wanted to make sure I could wear it off the shoulder. Even though it fits and looks fine in the body/torso… Oh but I cannot wear it off 2 shoulders, Metal It just slips back up not exactly what I was looking for. I would have to order two sizes bigger than what I wanted to get look in the picture shown. I’m gonna keep it. I’ll just have to wear it a little differently than planned, I would definitely order one to two sizes bigger if i wanted it oversized. I’m a true medium . I ordered a large. I would at least order an XL if I wanted it to look like the baggie off the shoulder style. . That being said, it’s very soft good quality the neck will look a little odd if you don’t wear it off the shoulders, but you can work with it. But for $50 sweater, I would hope the sizing chart would be accurate. I ordered blk it’s  a light weight sweater but fairly warm l. Biggest complaint would be the sizing issue I would’ve known. I definitely would’ve ordered a bigger size. I don’t feel like returning it and going through all that hassle..",7

When I say this is now the softest sweater I own, I mean it. I really like the way it's not restrictive of my wrists nor tight around the waist line, so I am able to french tuck it with jeans, or let it hang over the top of my leggings! It looks just as it does in the product images, in both appearance and color - and the better than expected feel of the material, really put this on a pedestal for me. I would definitely recommend it, and I'm not one to normally splurge more than about 30 for a good sweater, but this one seems worth it in my opinion.",
