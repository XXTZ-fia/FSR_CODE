I’m 5’6 172lbs, I normally wear a men’s small shirt, and medium for shorts/ briefs/ joggers (30x30 pant) but these are just cut weird. Every time I bend down or sit, they slip below my uh, crevasse. I hate that feeling. And if you try to hike them, then you’re going up the crevasse and between the berries. I can sinch the drawstring tight and tie it, but that unfortunately does nothing. And to think, Amazon’s suggested size was small! Glad I went medium, probably could have done large though since they are just cut weird I can’t imagine that would have helped much, same problems just baggier in the legs. They’re good for the price as a camp/ around the house sweat, but be sure to go a size up from normal.",2
