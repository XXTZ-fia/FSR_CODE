Miss Campbell,Fit as expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10Y15I4MZXIVV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLK7S3TL,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Dark Grey,,This shirt fits exactly as expected. The fabric is very standard weight tee shirt fabric. The colors of the fabric are as expected. The images are the plasticy type added onto the fabric. They look slightly washed out in places which is intentional for the style. This washes well.,
"Kris Anderson, The Avid Reader",Comfortable T-Shirt with a Positive Message!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ACKO6SGTZHG6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLK7S3TL,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 30, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Red,,"This is a cute Valentine’s t-shirt. I am not a teacher, but I do not feel you need to be to wear this t-shirt.  It has a great message.  I ordered an extra-large (I am 5’ 7”, 130ish pounds, 36D) which fits just right--it is not too big nor is it form fitting.  I like my clothes to be comfortable which I am in this shirt.  The t-shirt is lightweight.  It is breathable and it has some stretch to it.  I like the retro looking design.  The white and pink stand out against the red. I love the positive message on this t-shirt. The t-shirt washes up great (cold water on colors cycle and then into the dryer for a couple of minutes before hanging up).  While I will be wearing this t-shirt during the first half of February (I wear a different Valentine’s each day through the fourteenth), I do feel the t-shirt can be worn any time of the year.",

LivingTheDream,So cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROMLMSVMUG9HP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CLK7S3TL,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 17, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Dark Grey,,"Shirt is just as it looks on Amazon. My 10 year old granddaughter wanted this but it only came in adult sizes. Since she's in that stage between a large/x-large child or an x-small adult. The smallest this shirt came was a small, so we got it in that size because she really liked it. Once it arrived, it looked a bit big for her, but she tried it on and it fits almost perfect. I personally don't mind it being a big large, because then she can wear it longer as she grows. The print is crisp and not blurry and the shirt itself is not flimsy. Overall, great choice!",

It's got a great message :). The tee itself is well made, the material is light weight but not see through. The graphic is really good, but it does have a little bit of that plastic feel in parts. This tee is TTS. I followed their size chart and chose my usual medium. It's perfect. This is a Valentine tee, but I think it works anytime.",
