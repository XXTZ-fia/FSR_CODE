It's very nice for the price, and the quality is good. The main body of the top is thick and not see-through, so you don't have to worry about adding another shirt under. It's a bit scratchy on arrival, but became soft once I put it through the wash. Very stretchy and fit my fuller bust nicely. Overall great purchase",
Mackenzie,Cute but very cropped,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HQJ40HIH1LB3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPY9Z4BR,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Plain Apricot,Verified Purchase,"This looks as pictured except it’s so cropped. I’m 5’7 about 150 lbs. it fits how I want it everywhere but the length is just about an inch and a half below my bust line. Even with high waisted pants you see a LOT of my upper stomach. There’s a time and place for it, but it’s not an everyday wear because of that. I probably could have gotten an XL and it would have fit still everywhere but the length still would have probably been shorter than I expected.",

The casual flowing style looks like something you’d wear to a festival, but it’s still dressy enough to wear to a lunch or dinner date. The fabric is heavier and stretchier than I expected, which is a good thing, but it still has an airy and soft feel to it. It goes great with jeans, leggings, or even shorts. Love it!",
