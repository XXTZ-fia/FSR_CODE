So they always clash with what I'm wearing. I found this shirt, which is a lightweight rayon material, that fits the bill. It comes in a plethora of colors, so I'll never be mismatched again. It has a little stretch to it, so it fits over anything I'm already wearing. I appreciate the tight cuff at the wrist. I have small hands and if the sleeves are a little long, it will cover my hands. The cuffs on this shirt keep the arms firmly in place. It also has a pocket on one side of the shirt; a perfect spot for your sunglasses. The shirt feels soft against the skin and washes well. The color stayed and there haven't been any loose strings to speak of. Putting it in the dryer at medium heat and taking it out just before it's totally dry, has led to no shrinkage whatsoever.

It is so perfect, and honestly goes perfectly with a scarf I have, so I am excited for it to be cool enough for me to try them out together.  The fit is pretty much on target.  I usually run between an XL and XXL, and the XL was large enough with this shirt.  The fabric is very stretchy and almost too smooth for my taste, but that is just a personal preference.  My only complaint is that the top of the pocket is kind of just folded over and not stitched down.  It is OK, but it sort of looks unfinished to me.  That is a minor issue overall.",

Considering all the other reviewers have talked about how it runs big and is oversized I’m pretty certain I did not receive the correct size top. It fits me on the snug side and doesn’t appear to be really meant for tall people. It looks boxy, too short and awkward. Additionally, there is a fold over on the pocket on the front of the shirt. Not sure how well that will wash or if it will have to be ironed to stay folded. All in all despite being a soft comfy material this top did not work for me.",

That said, rayon doesn't like heat, so I will likely hang it to dry. When cooler weather arrives I feel sure this shirt will become a staple in my casual-wear rotation.",
