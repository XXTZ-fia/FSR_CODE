The zipper does not inspire confidence, since it seems to be plastic teeth with a metal pull.  I wear this to work, where I need to be comfy and not care if I get dirty.

Starting with the fact that the color looked nothing like the picture of the grey-blue color that I ordered. It looked faded like it had been washed and dried 20 times already. It also didn't have that great feel of about 90% of the hoodies on the market these days from expensive and inexpensive brands. The description says these hoodies are 50/50 poly and cotton. I was hoping for an upgraded dupe feel, but this is just a basic cotton hoodie that you could get at any discount store....honestly some of the discount stores are now carrying some very impressive gym gear/hoodies these days. This is not one of them though. Yikes. Right back to Amazon it goes.",

Still not worth the money.)  Cons - Too big & boxy: Amazon recommended a size Large which is what I purchased. This was oversized beyond reason & just looks a mess & is ill-fitting. A Medium would have been better but may have resulted in shorter arms as the arm-length on this large can stand to be longer. - Thumb holes are wonky: I love a top with thumb holes but, I've found that most manufacturers don't get them right. This Automet brand definitely didn't! I could have cut these slit in the shirt myself as that's all it is. When thumb holes are done this way, it inevitably causes pulling if you stretch your hand/arms in any way. (This is coming from someone tall with long arms. However, I've never had this issue with thumb hole shirts from the large, fruit-sounding brand name so I know there is a right way to add this design feature.) - Zipper: The zipper pull just looks cheap, like something you put on if the original, nicer zipper broke & you needed to replace it. The zipper ""teeth"" are a darker grey which is nice but this unnecessarily big zipper pull is such a cheap looking silver, like something out of a grab bag or bubble gum machine.  I'm not a connoisseur of clothes from the fruit-sounding name brand but, if this is supposed to be a dupe for one of their pieces, as a few reviewers have noted, then I certainly hope the original version didn't cost a lot. There's nothing special about this sweatshirt in the way it looks or feels to me & could have easily been something on rollback in Walmart for $10. I would not recommend this.",

I got grey green and it does lean a little more towards mint than the picture but a nice muted/greyed mint. I love it. It does have a plastic zipper. Since other reviews mentioned the zipper breaking and issues with lint, I washed it zipped up and inside out on permanent press cold and put it in the dryer on permanent press. Came out great, no shrinkage and no damage to the zipper. I don’t think anyone would mistake this for a lulu, but it’s still a really nice looking and comfy hoodie.
