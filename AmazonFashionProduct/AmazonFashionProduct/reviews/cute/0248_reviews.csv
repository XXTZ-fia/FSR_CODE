Anthony Emmons,Cute dress and bow combo!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VH984Z4HXK2B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BVBB7TZV,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 9, 2023",Color: RedSize: 12-18 Months,,"I acquired this outfit through Amazon Vine. I was interested in it as a summer dress for my daughter. It's cute. I like the coloring and even the floral pattern, which I don't typically care for. This basically goes on like a onesie. Three plastic snaps at the bottom. Then the matching/coordinating bow. I could see putting on a pair of leggings first, then this over top on a cooler day, or at the least a onesie underneath with short sleeves. I honestly think this is the first girly outfit my wife and I both like!",
