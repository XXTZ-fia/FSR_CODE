I decided that if I didn’t like this top I could always donate it versus returning it. I ordered the XL because I’d rather have a top that  is too big rather than too small. I was pleasantly surprised when I received the top. It is so soft and lightweight and looks much nicer than a fleece lined sweat shirt.  I could’ve purchased a smaller size - but I’ve yet to wash this so I don’t know how much this will shrink -I will update this review after washing and drying this top. I love the black top accented with gray.  I’m very happy and comfy. The price is right and that’s also a big plus.,
