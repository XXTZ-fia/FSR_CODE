"Grateful, Thankful, Blessed",Super Cute and Soft,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTOFSMTEZAAYP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CD7RHK5T,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 6, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,This top is super cute with good quality material that is soft. I was not expecting the cut-out to only be on one sleeve but that was my mistake. I guess I didn’t look at the picture close enough. The buttons on my shirt are silver not gold and I think I would have preferred gold. I am 5”1 and 160 pounds and ordered a size Medium in the grey which is a great fit. I like it so much I’m going to order in another color.,2
Amazon Customer,Very stylish!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MOTQHRTULVVD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CD7RHK5T,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 9, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Coffee Brown,Verified Purchase,Im a Large in tshirts so sized up to XL for a roomy fit. Fits perfectly. Bought the brown. Very comfy but not crazy about the gold buttons... They look silver in the description. The buttons are the reason for dropping to 4 stars. Maybe replace w/silver or remove all together. Made well & recommend.,2

HeckYeah22,Super Cute: Runs Large,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OOT680PFZ8I9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CD7RHK5T,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 29, 2024",Size: X-SmallColor: Burgundy,Verified Purchase,"I bought this shirt in the green/teal and the burgundy.  The shirt's exactly as pictured and is super cute.  The only issue I have is that it runs large.  I'm 4'11 and weight 104 pounds. I bought an XS, which is my usual size, but the shirts are a bit too big.  I'm keeping them because I (stupidly) cut the tags off - and because I really like them - but I'm going to wash and dry them with the hope that they shrink a bit.  Keeping my fingers crossed!!  :)",

Cheryl Journey,Stylish sweater,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UFSXGQOEZ4OW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CD7RHK5T,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 24, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Green,Verified Purchase,This sweater is made well. The decorative buttons on the wrist area are a nice touch. I don't feel that the sizing is completely accurate. I would order a size up if you're thinking of ordering this sweater. I went by their sizing guide and the sweater is slightly snug. I don't like certain clothing fitting snug. Otherwise it's a nice sweater.,

I ordered the medium.  I am 5'5"" and weight 150 lbs.  It's a perfect fit.  It is a soft and stylish shirt.  Very flattering.  The only reason I knocked off a star is because I don't love the buttons.  They are cheaper plastic buttons, and they look like cheap plastic.  It's not enough to make me stop wearing the shirt.  I may even remove the buttons.",6
