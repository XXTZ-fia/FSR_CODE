In tops I generally wear a Medium to Large and in bottoms I can wear anywhere from a 4 to 10, so it’s hard for me to verify if something is TTC in my opinion.  I first bought this top in a larger size a few years ago and loved the style. After some weight loss, I reordered it in a Medium, but I’ve found it runs a bit big. While the fit and design are great, the material doesn’t hold up well over time. It develops odd markings that aren’t visible to others when worn but made it hard to resell—so I donated my old one instead. Despite this, it’s still a cute and versatile piece for work or casual outfits!",

If it were all white or a lighter color, I anticipate it would be see through.  Size / Fit: I typically wear a size 6, S, or M for a shirt depending on the style and brand. I wear a 34D or 36C in bra and am 5'7"". I purchased this in a small based on Amazon's recommended sizing, and think it was the right fit for me. A M would have been too big. The shirt is a little boxy (vs. fitted shape) and I found the chest area to be a little tight although it's not too bad. I don't think anyone else would notice and like it enough to keep it.  Style: I really like the ruffled neckline and the 3/4 sleeves. It's a great shirt for the end of summer/beginning of fall. You can dress this up or down.",4
