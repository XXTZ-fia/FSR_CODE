Nearlycrunchymama,Super adorable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37U8ZMDU16TC6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7VNL91X,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2024",Size: 12-18 MonthsColor: Brown Plaid,Verified Purchase,"Super cute!  I love that it is all one piece so that it doesn't get scrunched up or disheveled!  Only cons are it does seem to run a little short (I just sized up), might be that I just have an extra long baby.  The other is that the snaps do not hold well, the outfit likes to go up a bit and then the snaps come undone, might be my baby's length again or that we cloth diaper (although it is nice and roomy around the diaper) but they are very easy to unsnap so I think they would work better if they were stronger snaps.",
