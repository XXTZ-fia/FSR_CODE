It’s thick and made well! It’s almost more like a sweater coat weight. Can be worn alone with a cami underneath or as a sweater coat in the spring and fall.  Love it!! I did return it for size. I purchased a small, my normal size, but I wanted it to come down a but longer. I’m 5’6” and 110-115 lbs. I also wanted that really oversized look like the model in the photos. The small definitely works but I just like sweaters really big so I can wrap them around if I’m cold. When returning for size I ended up ordering 3 colors so I could compare and see which I like best! They have so many beautiful colors! Unfortunately I’ve heard Amazon is cracking doen on returns. I hope nit because without an actual storefront you really have to order multiple sizes and colors to try on. This is my first time purchasing from Dokotoo and if all of their products are of this quality I will be ordering more!",

I also *could have* done the L for a smidge shorter effect (and still been able to button)... Ultimately kept the XL because of sleeve length. It's perfect now. Listen, this is at a cheap price point, but the quality is great. No snags, buttons on firm (not too tight they pop off in wash.) It also washed well! I can't say anything about tossing in the dryer, as I block and air dry all my sweaters for shape/form purposes. But there was little if any shrinkage in the wash. Stoked to have this for the fall! Durable enough to be a part of my wardrobe for a while!",14
