Stephanie M,It's OK,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZEPK8CS4TJVI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPVDTCS5,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Color: NutmegSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,I was in need of sweaters for travel. I liked the say this looked in the picture but it doesn't look quite the same on me. The material is a little itchy but I'll be wearing thermals underneath so I hope it won't bother me. The smell is a little off putting because you can't just wash it away. Washing should be done on delicate cycle with flat drying. So at lot of maintenance but the sweater is acceptable. I just wish it looked a bit more stylish.,

I unfortunately didn’t get a picture, because I put it on for work EXACTLY how the influencer styled it- with black tights, a lace slip skirt, and black combat boots. I didn’t love the texture and thought it was scratchy, and the look was just too oversized, but I was already dressed and had to get to work. It was definitely nice and thick, and I loved the extra long sleeves that allow me to pull my hands up into my sweater sleeves when my hands are cold, but it was too scratchy and wide for me. I lasted about 2 hours in this before I ran down the street to H&M and grabbed a similar but softer and smaller sweater (for $17 less!!) and changed in the car. For reference, I’m 5’7 and 108-112 and a much smaller size would’ve fit better and still been cute and oversized. If you’re around my size, this will be way too big. Lastly, the price point on these is crazy, these sweaters are $30 sweaters at most. I sent these back and got two similar but softer and not so “boxy” sweaters for the price of one.",

The chunky knit gives it a stylish, cozy vibe that is both trendy and practical for winter. It’s also surprisingly easy to care for, holding its shape and softness even after several washes.

They look identical and use the same pictures. I originally purchased from them and the sweater felt like a cloud. But needed a black sweater so purchased from this seller by mistake thinking it was the original one. The sweater does look identical in every way, except the fabric is totally different. This sellers fabric is scratchy while the other is super soft chenille like. I needed a black sweater pronto for an event so I kept it, but not pleased. I will say it kept me very warm on a cold blustery day and gave me look I was going for, but in future will need to wear it with a shirt underneath adding bulk. Not so with the other brand/seller. Purchase your true to fit size for perfect oversized look. Material is thick. Doesn't wrinkle. I would recommend the other brand over this one.  Update- this came with a slight odor, just thought it was new sweater smell. Washed it according to directions. And it definitely has some sort of chemical smell that didn't wash out. Yuck. Wish I could get a refund on this but already washed and wore it. So disappointed. Don't buy at least the black one.",8
