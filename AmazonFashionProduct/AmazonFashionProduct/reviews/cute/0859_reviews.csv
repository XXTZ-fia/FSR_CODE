Elizabeth,Cozy Sweater,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RW209JB0UZHCM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCBJMK6K,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Apricot,Verified Purchase,I like the feel. The fit too. What I am disappointed in is the way the black from the bows bleeds into the white of the sweater. I say bleeds….the black yarn from the underneath side shows thru the white. It’s not enough to return. I wore it and quite liked it. Just not perfect. So 4 stars.,

It took forever to arrive, and when it finally did, the quality of the sweater material itself felt a little cheap to me. On top of that, all of the bow accents are very poorly placed. The sweater looks fine from far away. But up close, you can see that the bows are very sloppily placed and there’s some bleeding of the black color around the bows. I’m so disappointed. I was really looking forward to wearing this sweater but ultimately will be returning it.",

A. Hefner,Unflattering cut - very boxy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GT3SSQTW8CME/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCBJMK6K,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 27, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Burgundy,Verified Purchase,"The fabric is soft enough. The color is lighter and pinker than the Burgundy shown, which I do not like. My real issue with this sweater is the cut and sizing. The sweater is cut much shorter than shown in the product photos, so it doesn't even partially cover my butt. I used the size chart provided and sized up based on the measurements, hoping for a looser fit.  I'm 5'2. The size chart measurements indicated that I should order a small, but I ordered a medium, hoping for a looser fit. I'm glad I ordered the medium, because this sweater runs smaller than their size chart indicates. I wanted to wear this for Christmas dinner, but I'll return it and find something else. This style is not flattering on me... very boxy.",6
