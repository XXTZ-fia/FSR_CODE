On the positive side though, the colors didn’t bleed in the wash. Washed in cold water and how heat in the dryer. So maybe line dry would be best. There are zero washing instructions on the shirt, so who knows.  I would not buy from this company again.",3

The heart is larger than it appears in the picture in the listing. Also, it is not a regular print or a fabric appliqué as I assumed from the looks in the picture. Instead, it is the rubbery type of appliqué print and it isn’t very well done either. The fit is true to size. I’m 5’7” 150 lbs 36DDD and I wear size large tops. This size large fits me well. Overall, this shirt is not what I expected in terms of the fabric and I really don’t care for the big rubbery heart on the front, but it fits well and it is comfortable to wear, so it will make a good home wear shirt.",
