The fabric is lovely and soft with a nice drap, but does wrinkle easily, It is not thick like the photo seems to iply (at least for the brown color). Sadly, these just look frumpy. I am 5'6 123lbs and a size 0/2 (26w jeans). I ordered a small. The waist is so high that it goes up to my rib cage and they hit me at an awkward spot on my leg - not short enough to look intentionally cropped but not long enough to be the proper length. To get the length look for the model you'd have to be 5'3 or less. There is also an excessive amount of fabric in the front from the waistband to the crotch, which is what makes it frumpy and unflattering. This goes beyond stylishly oversized and ventures into ""is she wearing adult diapers"" territory. It's sad because the legs are cute and they really are soft and comfy. They could take a good 4 inches out of the area and it would probably look incredible. The search continues. These are going back.",9

(At 5’ 2” and 165 the L is comfortable).  - The wide top band is really comfortable and gives good, but holding, stretch.  - The material is really soft and comfortable on the skin, but see the cons.  - I haven’t found any stitching or construction errors (but see cons).  NEUTRALS:  - I feel like a grandma.  - The drawstrings are purely decorative.  - You’ll want to be at least 5’ 5” for these or know how to hem. These are long bois.  CONS:  - The material is soft and silky - they’re nothing like actual sweatpants, more like track pants.  - The pleats in the front are not a fold/pleat, but a straight sewn-in line; it’s photoshopped in the images so this isn’t clear. I honestly thought I had them inside out for a second.  - Seriously, I feel like a grandma.  WOULD I PURCHASE?: Absolutely not. I wanted sweatpants, which these are not. I’m pissed and I didn’t even have to pay out of pocket for them. At $30.99 they’d be okay in terms of pricing if they were what I wanted/expected.  CONCLUSION: These are a silky/smooth material and not at all sweatpants. The line on the front is a ridge that’s sewn all the way down. They’re long, so you’ll have to hem or be at least 5’ 5”.
