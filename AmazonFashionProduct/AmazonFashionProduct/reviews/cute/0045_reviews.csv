ALH,Cute and Comfortable!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXKDCRSJDJO6P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMRHXY8,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Color: Wine RedSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"Recently purchased several clothing items. I liked this tank so much, I got it in two colors. I love the asymmetrical detail which adds a little interest to an otherwise plain top. Very cute!",

SuLu,Cute & comfortable top w/criss-cross seams adding interest (fabric is quite thin & light),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UD18TB14U4LM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMRHXY8,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: BlackSize: XX-Large,,"This is a cute top and I really like the versatile style as I can wear it now with a cardigan or layered under an unbuttoned shirt as well as on its own later on when the weather is warm. I usually wear a size XL in t-shirts these days, but I went with an XXL this time to make sure of the loose, flowy fit seen in the product description. The top is generously sized, so my regular size would have been fine. Even though it is a bit oversized, and I can't count on the material shrinking in the wash, it still looks nice. I am only 5'4"" tall and this top is tunic-length on me, which I like. The arm holes are just right, so there is no pulling and I also don't have to worry about the sides of my bra showing. I really like the high neckline for something different from my usual tank tops. I also think the criss-cross seams stitched across the front elevates the look so this top can look casual if worn with jeans as well as a little dressier if worn with slacks. I chose the black color and the seams, while prominent, aren't really as noticeable as they seem to be in the other colors available. The fabric content is exactly as described and it is light-weight and rather thin without feeling flimsy. It feels smooth and drapes nicely + the top doesn't cling as I thought it would (thank goodness). It just falls gently to just below my hips but stays close to the body. The small percentage of rayon seems to help the material breathe and the top feels very comfortable. I expect I'll be able to wear it for all but the very hottest days of summer. I machine washed this top in cold water using a gentle cycle and put it on a hanger to dry as I don't think the material is robust enough to go through my dryer. It came out looking nice with no fading or loss of shape. I didn't bother with a laundry bag as recommend in the description. The top is well made and the price seems reasonable. I'm glad I found it and I'm sure I will wear it often.",
KC,Nice fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2K8VF6NESSOG0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMRHXY8,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"Very nice top, needed more dressy tanks and these surprised me for the price! Wash nicely too",
dirge,Nice Top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TD1ZWM1UFL3A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMRHXY8,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Large,,I like the geometric pattern. It’s a subtle accent to a basic shirt. Fit is as expected.,
Mel,Nice quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E1GT7DL2Y2GT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMRHXY8,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Color: WhiteSize: Large,,This mostly polyester tank has a stretch to it. The simple design on the front dresses it up a bit from being overly casual. The fit is nice. I ordered a Large and it's still roomy enough without hugging my belly. The material is thick and not see through.,
Groker,Simple Design with Comfort,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SAM30QDDY1ME/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMRHXY8,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Color: Wine RedSize: Medium,,"The arm holes are the perfect size--not baggy and not too small either. The shirt hangs comfortably without being baggy or too tight. It's loose, but not shapeless. It should be really nice for hot days. It's a polyester blend that is machine washable and tumble dry low. The stitching detail on the front almost looks like wrinkles, but I think it still has a nice effect.",
Mary M,Flattering and Comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TE1D6LP4NVHP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMRHXY8,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Color: Dark GreySize: XX-Large,,"So, typically, this cut of shirt makes me look like a lumberjack. The maker of this shirt is conscious of body shape, and didn't just make a sheet and stitch it together. This is a flattering tank for those of us with more...ample...assets. It's also very soft and comfortable. My only complaint would be the tags, but I removed them and am quite happy.",
JJ,Beautiful tank,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R227O8KL9V5TBU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMRHXY8,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Color: Dark GreySize: Medium,,"I love this decorative tank top because I can dress it up or down. I can wear it with a cardigan or jacket, or I can wear it by itself. It’s got enough visual interest to wear alone, but it pairs well will other items.  The design is very pretty and flattering. It fits my tall/thin, slightly curvy frame well, and I’m comfortable in it. I’m always paranoid when my tops are too short, and I hate tucking things in (apart from a classy French tuck at times lol).  The color is exactly as shown on the Amazon description and photos. The material is nice and soft. It’s easy to care for too. I would love having one of these in every color!",
danielle,Fits just right,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R390XXNJCN1QOY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMRHXY8,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Color: Wine RedSize: Large,,I was very pleased with the fit of this tank-it's not too loose or baggy and not too snug fitting either. It is a good length and modest fit. The color is a pretty light heathered burgandy. One thing I noticed is that the seam details intersect on the chest so the placement is a little odd but I still like the top and will wear it a lot I'm sure.,
Cottage Farm,Nice top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23XO7MEVA6UZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMRHXY8,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Color: Dark GreySize: X-Large,,"I wasn't sure, but I do like it. The gray is pretty dark and it fits me perfectly which is not the norm. The armholes aren't saggy or too tight, which is nice. I like that it isn't tied around my waist, it's drapey, definitely a good thing with my increasing middle after the holidays. I'm going to order another color because it is nice with the seams giving it some interest.",
Ballet All Day,"Nice shirt, unique stitching on the front.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDO7596B96YNE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMRHXY8,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Color: WhiteSize: Small,,"This shirt is a basic tank with a twist- it has unique stitching on the front which gives it some elevated style.  It’s very comfortable- not tight, but also not oversized.  It’s soft and the white isn’t too see through which I find happens with tops in this process range.  I’m happy with it!",
ElBee,Good summer shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MZRN07UQ6E0E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMRHXY8,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Color: Dark GreySize: X-Large,,"It's a lightweight fabric, but not sheer, so can be worn solo in hot weather. I like the seaming in the front which makes it a bit more interesting than a plain expanse of fabric would be. It can also be worn as a base layer under a shirt in cooler weather. I got it in the dark gray color which is just like the seller photograph. True to size fit.",3
