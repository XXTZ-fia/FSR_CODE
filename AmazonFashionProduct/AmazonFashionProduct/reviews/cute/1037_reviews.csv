This is not a thick cozy sweater like it looks It is a very thin material. It also seems a lot shorter than what it looks in the picture both the sleeves and down at the waist. The sleeves are too short for me so I have to roll them up. I bought this because I had a baby not long ago and I was hoping for something a little bit looser around the midsection like it looks in the photos, but it’s really not that loose in the mid section and shows everything.

It’s still a nice color, but just not what I was anticipating.  Pros: Soft, comfortable fabric that feels great to wear Relaxed fit with decorative buttons for a stylish touch Great value, especially when purchased on sale  Cons: Color is a bit different than expected (more greenish than tan) Could be a bit smaller for those who prefer a more fitted look  Overall, I’m happy with this purchase and look forward to wearing it for Thanksgiving. Would recommend it if you're looking for a comfortable, stylish top for the fall season!",2
