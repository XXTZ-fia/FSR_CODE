I posted a Pic just bc I always wish ppl would do it it to help me decide what size to get! I am 5'3 200-205lbs. I usually wear a Large for more fitted but still comfortable and not tight, or XL for bigger more comfortable (but not oversized).  This fits exactly how I'd want a large to fit. How I'd want a tee shirt to fit, but as a sweatshirt I'd prefer it a little bigger. Usually on amazon if I order an XL it's WAY to big. So I tried large. I'd say it's 100% true to size!!!  The material is super soft!! Nothing like I expected. The seams are good quality and it's made very well. I can't beleieve these are as cheap as they are! They're thick and warm but not super thick like alot of sweatshirts. They have way more stretch them than expected so if you like a tight fitted look. - probably downsize!  The color is great. How ever, I feel like EVERYTHING would stick to this material and show. I have to return to get a bigger size so I didn't get to wear and make sure.",14

This will NOT happen with this shirt! By design, it appears to be a nicely manufactured, casual slightly oversized shirt. My mom asked to fwd the product link. She liked the feel too. It's so buttery soft. I can't wait to wear it. 😊 The manufacturer needs to go with it. Make a scoop neck, v-neck, fitted ladies tee - this is a beautiful fabric. 5 stars 🌟",7
