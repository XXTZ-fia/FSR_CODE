I went up a size larger as the blouse tapers at the waistline…did an exchange. The blouses did have a very a strange smell to them…almost like a HEAVY smoke scent. Once washed before wearing, the scent was gone.",
Shay,Love,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DJR9XSPIBPJX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CDWWCFH3,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 24, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Apricot,,"As someone with a somewhat fluffier midsection, I was hesitant about a shirt like this because this kind of material can sometimes be clingy, revealing those unwanted curves. But I loved the sleeve detailing on this so much I decided to give it a try. It’s a lightweight airy material that’s comfy and breathable. Considering it is lighter, I was waiting to see if it would snag on something like my nails and thankfully it hasn’t so far. For me, it’s about the versatility. It has enough length and looseness at the waist that you could wear it tucked in or out. I’m a mom who’s got a bit of a mom pooch so for me, I preferred to have mine tucked into high waist pants. In the case of the picture I’m uploading, I wore it tucked in with (what I wore as) high waisted “leather” pants. I also added a cincher belt to accentuate the waist and help camouflage some of my unwanted bulges. But as you can see, it does hug the curves so I would say size accordingly and be mindful of this when choosing your undergarments. I would say it fits pretty much true to size but you may want to go up a size if you’re looking for a looser fit.",15

It’s an “ok” top.  If I saw it in a store I’d probably keep going. The fabric is not as I expected and it feels like a swim/sun shirt fabric. Sort of clingy and shiny… not a fan. The sleeves are actually quite pretty and I wish the fabric for the body was a rayon or quality soft cotton. Then I think it would warrant higher ratings. I’m usually a small or medium and I ordered a large based on other reviewers. It’s really too large for me.  I should have ordered a medium. 5”8” tall 130 lbs for reference. In my opinion the fabric ruins it. Looks inexpensive.",22

It's definitely t-shirt material, makes it very comfortable to wear. It's versatile enough to wear this with some dressy slacks or skirt or dress down with jeans.
