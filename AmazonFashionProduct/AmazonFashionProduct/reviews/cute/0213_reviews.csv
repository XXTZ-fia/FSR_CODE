Ms Mama C,Upsize - not long enough & material is too thin,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D3QD7B6S8JWZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CBS984RT,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Color: B BlueSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I was so hopeful that I had found a nice long tunic I could wear with my leggings. I even upsized just to make sure I would have a looser fit and maybe add a little bit of length. Sadly, I was disappointed. The top is so soft and I absolutely love the pockets. The shoulder is flattering the way it's gathered. It adds a bit of feminine and dressy flair. Why was I disappointed? We'll, for starters I'm a 5'8 curvy girl - I've got hips - and I like my tops/tunics to fall long enough to cover my backside. I don't know how tall the model is but the tunic looks to fall about mid thigh on her. On my body it barely covered my backside. And even though I have sized it is definitely not flowy as it looks on the model. I normally wear a large or a size 12/14 in women's and I decided to order an extra large in this tunic. Also, the material is very, very thin. Not at all what I was expecting. It's yet another Amazon clothing fail and I will be returning the top.",
