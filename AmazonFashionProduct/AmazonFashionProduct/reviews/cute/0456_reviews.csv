It’s nice and stretchy and a good material which was comfortable, but kept falling off arms, would recommend if you have a wider torso and size down as much as possible. Hope this helps!",
Vanya,Nice top watch the sizing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RVE3WJJM8OL1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CD25K9RV,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 18, 2023",Size: LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,It is a.  nice top but I wouldn’t recommend it for DD bra sizes. It fit in the chest but what happens when you get it to fit the chest is it falls of your arms because the top is wider. Unless you have a wide chest and back area I  wouldn’t buy.,
