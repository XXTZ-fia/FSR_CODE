The material is lightweight but with the double lining is on the thicker side. Not too tight in the sleeves. It’s full length but you can also scrunch it up a little to suit your torso and preferences.  Update: I also got the green color. I sized down to XS for a more fitted look. It’s SO cute. I’m obsessed with the twist front. Makes the chest look good. It’s a warmer material,
