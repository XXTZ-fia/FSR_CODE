I'm tall and slender, but this made me look kind of fat and had an odd puffy fit.  I like the thickness of the fleece, though.  I think this would be really cute if it just had a straight fit, without an elastic at the bottom.  And no notch on the collar.  I ordered 3 sweaters, and really thought I would love this one.  But kept the other and am returning this one.  Looks like other people had better luck with this, though.  With easy returns, it's worth trying if you think you'll like it.",6
