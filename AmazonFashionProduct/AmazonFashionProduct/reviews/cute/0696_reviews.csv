Jaclyn Sky,"Crop top if your anywhere near or around 5'8""",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16ML2B61QGTCT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2KC5XXK,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Light Green,Verified Purchase,"This is great for my long arms, but dear god, this is definitely a crop top (I'm 5'8"", 180 lb.) Either that, or someone with no torso. It's too short, which makes it a poor fit. I bought this because it looked like a full length shirt in the picture. But it goes up at least 2 inches above my belly button.  The positives are that this shirt is sooooo soft, and the sleeve length fits. Amazing quality material that is incredibly soft.  I gave it to my 18 year old daughter who appreciates crop tops (she is 5'7"", 140 lb) and it still fits her as a crop top above her belly button.",

Sleeves aren't too long, it's a mild almost crop top length, super super soft, has some stretch, not thick not thin. Got her an extra small, she is 53 in tall, 100#, 33-30-34. The reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is that we ordered 4 more 2 in small and 2 in extra small. And all 4 fit differently depending on the color. The navy is tight with no stretch and the pink is super stretchy and is ""bigger"" than the small as an xs. So keep that in mind that you may want to size up if you aren't sure.

We Review It!,Extremely Soft!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18VLB5T04RJ7I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2KC5XXK,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 24, 2024",,,The fabric is much softer than I expected. It feels like a blanket and it’s very warm. The coffee color looks a bit purple toned in person but it is extremely cute. The sleeves are very long which is nice for my long arms. I ordered an XS and it fits very nicely without being too short. The ribbed fabric is a nice feel and not too noticeable upon wearing. Great shirt for a great price.,4
VicFan,Great for matching with jeans,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Y8LU9NS1Q42/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2KC5XXK,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 20, 2024",,,"This modern, cute, well made, top has thumb holes in the sleeves and runs true to size.  The material it is made from is not too thick nor too thin but is soft and comfortable.  The sewing is excellent.  I washed it in cold water and hung it to dry and it came out wearable.  This is great for matching for with jeans.",
Silver Girl,Be Ready Because It is Truly 'Crop',https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNIEFGWJZUSPC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2KC5XXK,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 19, 2024",,,"WIHOLL Crop Top is seriously cropped.  Key Observations:  - Sleeves are quite long - Sizing is good - fits well - Color is vibrant and pretty - Material is ideal (not too thick nor too thin) - The mostly polyester fabric is soft and feels good on the skin - 10% spandex gives the top a more form fitting shape - Crewneck lays nicely - Construction and stitching are solid - no visible flaws - I like the subtle curve at the bottom - Ribbed style is good-looking  For your consideration:  I noticed the tissue in between the folded shirt and the clear plastic bag both were stained pink. I did a hand wash test and the color does run. I highly recommend not machine washing this shirt with other clothes in fear that everything will come out pink.  Overall, this is a good quality crop top and the value is decent based on the craftmanship and style (maybe a tiny bit high in price). Just be careful when laundering!",2
