I am curvey and carry my weight well.  I like shirts to fit a little lose due to I do have a little mommy pouch.  This shirt is nice.  It's light weight, good for spring and early fall.  It's nice material.  The sleeves are cute and have room, which for me is great beacuse I do have large upper arms.  I would recommend the shirt.  For me, it's a little more clingy than I would had liked, but I will wear it.",4
