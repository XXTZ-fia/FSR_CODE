I just can't get over how awesome the colors are in person.The material is nice and soft - great quality.  There were no stitching flaws at all.  I laundered it last night and it came out just fine.  Still soft and colorful and it didn't look like there was any shrinkage.I'm so happy I got this - it will look so nice on baby!  I'm satisfied completely and recommend this cute outfit!",
