Was remarkably softer than I thought and also much better quality than I expected! I was afraid it might be too small but as you can see it is a little oversized. It is long in left and generous in body size but the banding/knitted bottom helps it to stay out around waist or hips if you want to wear it that way.  This one looks boxy on me because it’s a little too big but I’m going to see how it looks after I wash and dry( I usually air dry sweaters but will dry this one to see if it shrinks up at all)  On a final note? I will DEFINITELY be buying more in other colors as this is such a quality look and feel to it! It surprised me as I never buy anything but cardigans online because I need soft but structured pieces and I took a gamble and I love it! Will be cool enough to wear on cool not so cold evenings but warm enough to layer over a tank or tee if needed  Will update after wahsings",16

My wife's review:  This quarter zip pullover collared sweater is quite nice. The fabric is a 50% viscose, 28% poly, 22% polyamide which is machine washable (preferably in cold water, delicate cycle) and while the instructions suggest hang drying, I'm going to tell you to lay it flat to dry so you don't stretch out the shoulders or get wonky hanger bumps. The fabric is very soft, you shouldn't have a problem with any itchiness or irritation as you would with typical wool. The zipper has a faux leather pull, and the sweater front panel features a woven cable stitch design. The rest of the sweater is a flat weave with drop shoulders, set knit cuffs and hem.  The fit is a little oversize and (hallelujah!) seems true to the size chart. The sleeves are a little long, but the cuffs do allow for folding over or pushing up. It is not cropped, it falls well below the waist. You could definitely wear a t-shirt or button down blouse underneath.  I'm definitely thinking about grabbing another one in the grey.
