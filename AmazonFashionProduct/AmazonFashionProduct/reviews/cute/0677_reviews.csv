It is a good long length, so whether it's worn tucked or out it provides good back and lower back-bum coverage. I'm 5'7"" and this covers almost down to my hips. The sleeves are nice and long and stay in place...no sneaking up the arm. It is a bit thicker fabric than the silky kind, the inside fabric is brushed  making it soft and warm, while the outside is a cotton-ish and matt, not shiny. It isn't see through so can be worn alone, but I find it just right for layering. That is doesn't look like long underwear means it can be worn under vests, too, not just shirts or sweaters. It provides a wonderful warmth. I've worn this under tops and sweaters and alone in the house in NJ winter temps. I love it and am back for more colors.  Definitely recommend this one over the thinner and more expensive brands. It washes well too, but I have to add that I hang my clothes to dry (energy saving).",2
