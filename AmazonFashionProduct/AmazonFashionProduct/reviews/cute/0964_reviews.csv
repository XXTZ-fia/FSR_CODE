Size up if you want more drape. A large would have been less slinky and would have fit me just fine in the shoulders and armpit area. I wish I sized up but this will work great as an under-top. I'm wearing a solid black undergarment, which can not be see through the fabric (which is a thicker, more matte-like version of bathing suit material). I like that it's not translucent. Impressive quality, fit, stitching and design at this price point. Thumbs up from me.",2

I typically wear a size large but glad that I ordered extra large. This top nicely fits under a blazer and can be worn tucked and untucked.",

I'm a true size medium (5'3, 135 lbs and 34D) so I stuck with my size— as other reviewers have noted, it's very form fitting— but I personally like how it fits and it does seem to have a bit of stretch. However, I would size up if you're looking for something more loose. I wore mine tucked in with high waisted jeans so photos show what it looks like tucked in vs. out.  Pros: material is soooo soft and smooth, a pretty shade of red, stays tucked into my jeans without moving, flattering neckline. Cons: runs a bit small, shows every bump possible lol",5

I am short waisted so I appriciate the length. Or lack of length. It is well stitched. Nothing loose. Also it is true jet black. Very flattering.",

Definitely runs every bit as small so if you want a fit that isn’t skin tight you’d need to size up by like 2 sizes or so. I got a medium even though I usually wear a size small top, and the medium is still skin tight. I don’t mind because I’m planning to wear it under high waisted shorts and skirts, but I would never wear it alone as a shirt given how tight it is. The material is very soft and stretchy though, no issue there! The neckline is a bit on the wider side, be mindful of that re: your bra pick if any.  Overall it’s a nice closet staple - I love a solid colored soft shirt that layers well, and this does. :)",

I'm always in need of white shirts, and for some reason the ones I have are not that flattering. I picked this one out to try with my leggings (which I wear 80% of the time). The shirt is stretchy, almost compression like but not in an uncomfortable way. It's very easy to wrinkle release. The shirts stretch along with my leggings allows me to show off my curves in a tasteful way. The shirt isn't too long so it doesn't look bulky or need any tucking in which I appreciate. I'm 5'6 and weight 165 and ordered a large, it fits perfectly.",

It true to size. It fits snug, as that is the style, but it's very stretchy. The material is very soft and feels pleasant on the skin. It hits right around the hips on me (5'2 for reference). The only negative is  that it is not very thick, but for low price- $11.99 plus a 20% discount code at the time I'm reviewing - I wouldn't expect it to be double lined. However, since it is thin you can't go bra-less without the nips on display, and you can see the outline of my belly button. I will use this mostly when layering as it is cute and comfy.",

I am 5'4"" and about 150 lbs and usually wear a medium or large in tops. I will say this one runs a little on the tight side. It fits my shoulders and bust fine but is unattractively tight on my belly. I have an apple body shape so my belly is round, so other body types probably wouldn't have as much of a problem with this.  The fabric is nice and it washed in medium water and dried in medium heat well without shrinking.",

Machine washed and drip dried with no issue.,
Brenden D Richard,So cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VA123LEY4OR2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNMQM9JV,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Color: RedSize: Small,,"I recently picked up the shirt, and while I really love the color and overall design, there's one thing to note: it does have a tendency to outline the belly a bit more than I'd prefer. The fabric is soft and the fit is generally flattering, but it’s not as forgiving around the midsection. If you’re someone who prefers a looser or more relaxed fit, this might not be the most comfortable option.  That said, the vibrant red color is fantastic—bold yet not too overwhelming—and it definitely catches the eye. The shirt is well-made, and the material feels great against the skin. It pairs easily with jeans or chinos, making it a solid choice for a casual day out, though you might want to layer it with something else if you're concerned about the fit around the stomach.  All in all, it’s a stylish shirt, but if you’re looking for something that won’t cling to your belly, you might want to try a size up or choose a different cut.",
