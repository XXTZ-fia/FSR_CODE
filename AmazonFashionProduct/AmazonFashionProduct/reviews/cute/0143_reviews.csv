Both were on sale for $7.99 each. They are long enough and wide enough which shocked me because manufacturers tend to make shirts very short and wide nowadays. (Which really doesn’t look good on most people)  They were vacuum sealed in the package and I did have to spray them with a lot of water and hang them up to let the wrinkles out but I think they’ll be OK  The material is a little bit slick, stretchy and potentially clingy so body imperfections will show through depending on how you size and wear it.
