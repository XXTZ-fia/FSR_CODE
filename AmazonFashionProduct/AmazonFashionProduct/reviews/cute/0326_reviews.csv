I ordered a XL (my true to size) and XXL. I am 5ft 5in and 220lbs. I did read some reviews to order a size down cause its over sized but I like an oversized look on me to begin with. After getting them and trying them on I will say is if you want a true to size look but somewhat oversized go with your regular size. If you want an oversize look to cover your butt a little and wear with leggings or just like that look maybe go one size up. The quality is nice. I’ve washed them both plenty of times but I do hang dry them and they still look new still. They are a nice thickness but not too heavy.,

And I was right!The color is between a dark beige and a 'lighter' brown.  It has a very nice deep color (although a little bit bland by itself) and the fabric is soft and flattering.  The feature I liked the most were the sleeves.  The cuffs are longer so it makes the sleeves puff out just a little bit more so that detail is very nice.  Since I did order a smaller size, the fit on me was better: not too long and not too short and the details of being oversized is not lost on me.  You can still tell the shape of the sweater but I am not swallowed up by the sweater.  This sweater can be dressed up with a nice pair of slacks and shoes/boots or dressed down in a more casual look with jeans or leggings.  Overall, I like the sweater and would order another one in a more vibrant color (just to compare).",
