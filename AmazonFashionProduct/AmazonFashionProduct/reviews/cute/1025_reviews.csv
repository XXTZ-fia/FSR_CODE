The fabric is fairly stretchy so it slings to your body enough to provide a clean look if you tuck it into your jeans. I think it runs on the small side. I bought a medium and if it were a numbered sizing system it would be between a 4 and a 6. If you wear a size 8 or 10 and/or have a large bust line, the medium probably wouldn't work for you. Since it is stretchy, you have some ""wiggle room"" on sizing. I wash it in the washing machine with tap-cold water and toss it on medium heat for just a couple of minutes to take out some wrinkles then hang to dry in the laundry room. The color is not quite as peachy as it looked here online.",3
