Only complaint is the top is more of a crop top which I feel like defeats the purpose of a warm outfit. My daughter is very tall for her age so I appreciate that the length of the pants and sleeves are long and give time for growth but my the time the pants and sleeves truly fit that shirt is going to be a crop top. Washes great (I hang dry and it still stays super soft and doesn’t get stiff). Over all worth the price, I just wish I could order a size up in the shirt.",
