These are cut way too small - forget the size chart, it's not accurate at all. The waist is so tight and my daughter is skinny as it is, so they wouldn't fit a larger child. Not only that, but when she sits down, she says it squeezes her stomach and the pants are three inches above the ankles. Serious highwaters! Don't bother with these, totally unusable for us.",
