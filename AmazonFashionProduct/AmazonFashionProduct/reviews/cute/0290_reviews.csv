The colors look great, very true to the pictures. I probably could’ve done with a small, but the medium fits perfectly in the shoulders and under the arms so there’s plenty of room in the waist in case it shrinks. They are not too dressy, but will go well under blazers or sweaters for work or nice enough to go with jeans. Their lighter thickness will make it possible to layer in the cold weather or wear alone in Fall or Summer. Highly recommend.
