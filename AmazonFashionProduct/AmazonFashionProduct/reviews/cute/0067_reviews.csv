Love the ruffles in the blouse and the little beret hat is amazing touch.  The material is soft and in good condition.  Does not look cheap at all.  Looking forward to my little one wearing it this fall.,

tombo86,One of the cutest outfit!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1T224RM1EIUZW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D97RL96X,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 6, 2024",,,"This is one of the most adorable outfits I've ever seen. I got it for my niece and she looks like an angel. The top is nice but also a little on the thin side. The skirt and hat are of great quality and very soft. This is a must for the fall season. It fits her perfectly and she is almost 18 months old. Overall, I would definitely recommend this outfit.",
M,Super cute winter set!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1A4W9E8OGB7OS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D97RL96X,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 4, 2024",Color: PinkSize: 4-5T,,It is such a cute little set for little girls. I love the beret and the checkered style of this skirt. It will be perfect in winters with some pretty boots. I am not so kicked about the quality of the fabric though. It's soft but I feel it could be slightly better in terms of thickness. It will be useful for this season but not sure how it will be next year.,
P Smith,Adorable Outfit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LFWY35SLXL5R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D97RL96X,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 29, 2024",,,"This is the absolute cutest outfit! You get the beret, a long sleeve shirt and a skirt. The shirt is a plain cream color, the beret matches the skirt and the skirt is a dark brown and light brown plaid. The shirt is very thin so not sure about wearing in the cold winter months but will be perfect for early spring and fall months.  It looks so cute on and is good quality.  Very pleased with this  purchase.",
joe Phi,Adorable Outfit with Room for Quality Improvement,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RROEUEYCBZDU7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D97RL96X,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 23, 2024",,,"This baby girl outfit is undeniably cute and perfect for the fall season. The ruffle top, paired with the plaid skirt and matching hat, creates an adorable ensemble that fits well with the autumn aesthetic. The color combination, particularly the khaki top with the brown plaid skirt, is both stylish and seasonally appropriate.  The material of the clothing feels comfortable and soft against the skin, making it suitable for toddlers. However, the quality of the stitching leaves something to be desired. While the fabric itself is decent, the stitching isn't as durable or well-finished as I would expect. This might be a concern for parents looking for clothing that can withstand frequent washing and wearing.  The skirt is slightly longer, reaching below the knee, which is a nice touch for added warmth during cooler weather. It fits true to size, which is always a plus when shopping for kids' clothing online.  Given the price point, this outfit is reasonably priced for what you get. It's an affordable option for those looking for a cute seasonal outfit, though the quality might not make it the most long-lasting piece in your child’s wardrobe.",

Fits true to size maybe, a bit on the bigger side. The skirt is longer, below the knee. Quality matches price point. The hat has a nice stretch, to where it actually will fit and stay on.

Customer Review,Sewing quality not good,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CE8SVTZAGZ3M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D97RL96X,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 6, 2024",,,"This was covered in weird loose threads and missed seams, and the fabric quality feels and looks very cheap (like Temu quality clothing). It's fine for just 1 or 2 wears, but don't expect it to last you much longer than that. Not really worth it unless you just want it for an event or a few pictures.",
