Ordered 12/16 - got it on 1/30.  What's up with that?The shirt itself is just okay.  For a ""cotton blend"" it has a very POLYESTERY look and feel to it.  It's clingy, but I expect to be wearing a cardigan with it on the 14th.  I love the coffee-themed design, but the decal seems as though it won't survive repeated washings.  Luckily I'll only be wearing it one day a year.UPDATE:  I washed the shirt in cold water, and hung it on the line to dry.  The decal held up beautifully!",2

I ordered an extra-large (I am 5’ 7”, 130 pounds, 36D) after checking the size chart and it fits just right (it is not too big nor too loose).  I like the way the V-neck is done.  The shirt is well made with solid stitching (no loose threads or wonky stitching).  I like the cuffed sleeves (gives it a more feminine look which goes with the V-neck).  The hearts are well done.  The white of the hearts stands out against the vibrant red.  The shirt washes up great (it did not shrink, the color did not run, nor did it pill).  I do recommend washing the shirt inside out or in a mesh laundry bag which will extend the life of the graphic.  Best of all is the shirt is my favorite color.",2

Nina,"Runs small, but well made",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31FF2KF2JFOYW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07M6JCCQC,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 19, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: A-red-1,,"This shirt looked cute so I decided to try it out.  It looks great in person; the red is nice and bright and the printed white heart design stands out well. It also feels well made, with a pleasant-feeling and thick fabric, good stitching, and fun design elements like the v cut in the front of the collar and the cuffed sleeves.  Unfortunately it turns out I didn’t pay close enough attention to the measurements, or I would have realized the XXL would be a tight fit on me. That’s on me; the bust measurement is clearly about ½” short of my bust but I didn’t think to check it beforehand. I measured the width while I had the shirt laying flat and at the armpits it was just under 23.5” wide, then about 22.75” at the waist area, curving out to about 25.5” at the hem. I think this shirt is well worth getting provided you check the fit since it seems that these run a little small.",3
