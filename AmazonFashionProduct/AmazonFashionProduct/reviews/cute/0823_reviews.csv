Call me crazy, it said it was white so I ordered it. I guess elves got to the package en route and changed the color to cream. Either way...it's off white, not white. So if you don't care about the color.. Other than that, this is good quality. I have a hard time keeping the off the shoulder, actually off the shoulder. Sweaters/tops like this never stay down. Would be cute in a picture - or if you had a helpful friend/SO other around to help you keep it in place. But that's just a me thing - I shouldn't have ordered a style like this but one can always dream....oh, maybe there is some kind of way to tack down the edge so it stays in place? Either way, it was returned.",

I’ve purchased several items through her recommendations, and they’ve all been great! Unfortunately, this sweater didn’t live up to my expectations. I wore it for the first time to a friend’s birthday party at a club, and it started to rip shortly after I arrived. I tried to not move as much to prevent further damage, but the tear got worse until my arm was completely exposed. I had to leave early, which was really disappointing. I’ve bought a lot of clothes from Amazon and have never had a bad experience until now. It’s a shame because the sweater was super cute, but it ended up being a waste of money.",14

The sleeves are very long I have the folded up here, it’s a bit longer than in the model photo and not as tight. I don’t mind a little looseness in the torso and its length since I don’t like cropped stuff but I wish the sleeves were tighter fitted so it’d make me look less frumpy. The off-the-shoulder part does roll up if you move your shoulders a lot or lift up your arms all the way but thats to be expected in off-the-shoulder tops. I will say that the color is accurate, it’s warm to wear and soft to the touch, and it’s stretchy. Was hoping to wear this to a party but I might try looking for something else.",2
