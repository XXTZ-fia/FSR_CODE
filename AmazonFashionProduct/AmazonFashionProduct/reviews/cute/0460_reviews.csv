Looks exactly like the photos. Fits okay, too. Happy with the length of the sleeve. It's lightweight. Those pros get a 5-Star Rating.  The drawback and the reason for the 1-Star Rating is that rubbery polyester feel. I am not a fan of that type of poly. Glad I got the larger size as it isn't as tight and much of that icky feel is lost.  I wish they would have used better quality material.  This isn't the 60's or 70's.  Poly has made much improvement in 50 years, so why not take advantage of the ""new"" polyester material in this top?  While it's a great color and decent fit, I would NOT buy it again.",2
