True to their description, these sweatpants were indeed comfortable. They featured a soft, plush interior that kept me warm and a relaxed fit that allowed flexibility for daily activities. However, the delight in their comfort was overshadowed by the disappointing quality. After just a few wears, signs of wear and tear began to show. The fabric pilled excessively, and the seams near the waistband started to unravel. Additionally, the color faded after the first wash, which was surprising and upsetting for a relatively new garment. While they score high on comfort, the compromised durability and poor fabric quality make them a less desirable choice for anyone looking for long-lasting winter apparel.",5
