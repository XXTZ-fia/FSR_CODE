Secondly, this is a warm sweatshirt. It is extremely thick and the inner fleece is very soft! However, because of this the fabric when worn is pretty stiff even after washing a few times. It fits well, but was a tad shorter than I prefer in my sweatshirts. It lifts up and can show my stomach when I raise my arms. For reference, I am 5'5"" and 200 lbs and am usually in between L and XL sizing in women's clothing. I went with L with this sweatshirt and probably would have been happier with an XL for the additional length and bust. So if you are in between sizes and looking for a looser/comfier feel, I suggest sizing up. Overall, it's well made and a warm fabric so not too bad in my opinion.",10

Jeremy,"Soft and thick, warm but not bulky",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MHBD3NAGJLII/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CH17LYLC,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 19, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Light Green,,"The sweatshirt got much softer after an initial washing.  It's a nice thick material that keeps you warm, without looking to bulky.  The only complain is that the sleeves are a tad short for what my daughter likes, and when she puts her arm up, the sleeve rides up quite a bit.  Some people may not mind that, but it was enough that my daughter mentioned it.  The color seemed to match the picture, which was nice.  Very happy with the sweatshirt.",2

nyc_88,so much lint from the fleece lining!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YQFRTC8I8GWF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CH17LYLC,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 7, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Coffee Grey,,"I like to browse for cute fashion forward items I can look presentable in while at home and this one seems to fit the bill. While it said cropped on the page, other reviewers who said it was like medium crop (not as severe), sold me. I want to cover my stomach when its cold out - we are not trying to get sick! Even though the interior is a bit ""fleece"" like, nothing rubbed off onto the shirt I had underneath - always a concern for me when I see such linings. Even though the instructions said to hand wash, I put it in the washing machine on COLD and heavy with my other things. The lining of the inside got all over my entire load. I had so much to lint roll off. It was never ending when I was trying to shake it out of my load and the sweatshirt itself. I do not reccomend. No one is going to hand wash a sweatshirt. This is a poor quality lining that didnt reveal itself until after the wash.",7

It definitely does not feel cheap at all. It’s a thick soft sweatshirt. I love the V neck it has too. It’s so comfortable that I am thinking of going and getting more colors.",2

I needed it to justify the price, because this is expensive to me, and I think it does. It does not feel thin and cheap. This comes in lots of cute fall colors, and I'd be happy with any of them!",2
