TS,Perfect length and fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPQLB3C1XKIQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09PFNCJD1,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 1, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: _Grey,Verified Purchase,"I love these tanks they fit just right for my curvy body type. I’m 5’7 and wear a size 18.  They’re not too short either as I’m finding a lot of tanks and tees now have that cropped length that is just not flattering on me. The material isn’t too thin or too thick, they’re great to wear as a summer tank or layered in cooler temps. They also machine wash and dry well with no shrinkage. One last thing the shirt they have labeled as the color purple is more like a faded mauve/pink color which is why I bought the shirt. The color is pretty but most definitely not what I’d consider ‘purple’. Anyhow that’s the only thing I found a bit odd as far as the color label but as I said I bought it for the color shown not what the company listed it as. They do have actual ‘purple’ ones for those who want a true purple. Just thought I’d mention that.",

For some reason, clothing companies seem to be making shirts too long and too big. I'm not pregnant and don't want to look pregnant, nor do I want my shirt hanging past my butt. The length of these shirts you could tuck in or leave out. The tail does not go over my rear end. I have a farm and horses to take care of, so I'm outside most of the day in the summer.

I have to keep pulling it up so my breast aren’t so much exposed as for this army green one. I’d stay with your regular size even if you want it looser. It will stretch out as you wear it. I’m not sure how long this will last because of the stretch. This one feels softer than the wine color I got also. I got that one in  a small and the army green in medium, which I love the medium best because I like a slightly looser fit. I’m a 36A, longer on the upper torso than my legs. I’m 5’2 , usually a small or medium.  I love the green and wine . Love the kind of rustic kind of look. Very casual which is how I dress.  The green is a dark color then it shows in my video but lighter of course in brighter light. I got the T green also but getting that one tomorrow, i believe. I’ll do another review! As may as well.  I’m h and I hand washed it like the wine and it ran an odd almost pinkish color oddly. I’d wash any of these colors first unless it’s a very light color .  Soaked it in cold water , salt and vinegar. It’s makes your colors last longer.  The t green isn’t as soft as the army green. So odd . It irritated my upper armpit area  from the friction and the ribbed material. Also horrible to wear on a hot humid day. No airflow and made it itchy. I will only wear this in low 80 temps with no humidity.",3

However, being a 38D, and generally a size 10 -12 with a fairly trim (but far from perfect) torso, I bought it in XL, based on other reviews. But this is way too big, even after a wash in hot water and extra drying.  I think it's too late to send back after that, so I'll keep it - well actually, them, as I bought it in both dark gray and wine red and both have the same problem- so a word of caution: if you want this top to fit snugly and contour to your curves definitely DO NOT go a size up, or it will just hang off of you. The sizing chart corroborated that decision to order XL and the detailing (fabric patch) around the buttons has a rough, unfinished edge, so I'm taking a star off for that, but otherwise it's a very nice tank, not too thin not to thick.",9

I like the button design, though the area around that does curl up on the edges a little, but nothing that makes it look bad. Based on my experience the lighter colors (for me it was the light green and white ones) are a little see-through, but the darker colors (brown, dark grey, and black) are not.

I got the Pink T (I think) which looked like a medium blush color to me. I didn't want hot pink, baby pink, or just straight pink. I like the darker shades. It's off, more of a salmon shade. The stitching around the buttons, I like! That's 1 of the reasons I chose this. I like that it looks kinda shaggy and raw and not perfect. It's supposed to look this way guys!!! (I saw this complaint several times) All other stitching was great. I wear a black tank under it and you can't see thru it to for it to look weird or make the color look bad. I got XL and I'm 190 and 5 3. It fit slightly loose around my waist/hips, I almost exchanged it, but its so minor that I think a large would be too small. It appears kinda boxy shaped, which I'm not a fan of, cuz when you've got more body area, it just shortens it up even more, so i like slim fit and longer appearing tops better. You can always pull/scrunch them up a little, you're outta lot when you're outta fabric. BUT it wasn't noticeable while I was wearing it. Also, don't dry it when washing ! I never dry new items.",16
