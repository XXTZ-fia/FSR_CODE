The shirt isn't heathered at all - even though the photos might want you to think they are.  The shirt feels of substantial quality -- it has a nice weight to it.  Not thin and clingy, but not your beefy cotton tee -- think somewhere in the middle.  The sizing does appear a bit small -- but I wasn't quite sure what to expect as the size I ordered isn't listed on their chart -- so it was a gamble on my part.",

Note, this is not my normal size, so you definitely want to check the size chart.  The fabric content is listed as being a cotton blend, but my shirt is 65% polyester, 30% rayon, and 5% spandex.  I know that sometimes cotton is blended with all of these materials, and maybe that's what this is, but it's a little confusing.  Also, the tag says they recommend professional dry cleaning.  I absolutely did not do that.  I machine washed and dried it without any problem.  The print on the front is an iron-on transfer, and not screen printed, so it will wear out quickly if washed often.  It is a nice shirt. It's comfortable to wear and it looks nice.",

Unfortunately, the shirt runs very small. Regardless of the size, it is also not larger bust friendly. Even worse, the care tag states ""Professional Dry Cleaning Recommended"". For a t-shirt? I think not. That makes me think that this shirt will most likely shrink horribly in the dryer if home laundered. This would make the sizing situation even worse. In short, this shirt is not for me.
