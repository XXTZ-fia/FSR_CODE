I’m 5’7 and wear a size 18.  They’re not too short either as I’m finding a lot of tanks and tees now have that cropped length that is just not flattering on me. The material isn’t too thin or too thick, they’re great to wear as a summer tank or layered in cooler temps. They also machine wash and dry well with no shrinkage. One last thing the shirt they have labeled as the color purple is more like a faded mauve/pink color which is why I bought the shirt. The color is pretty but most definitely not what I’d consider ‘purple’. Anyhow that’s the only thing I found a bit odd as far as the color label but as I said I bought it for the color shown not what the company listed it as. They do have actual ‘purple’ ones for those who want a true purple. Just thought I’d mention that.",
