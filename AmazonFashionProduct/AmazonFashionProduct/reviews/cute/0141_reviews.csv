Monika,NEED TO PURCHASE!!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL26F3HY7GB94/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08FQYH9SF,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,I bought a large because I don’t want a bit too tight on me and so it doesn’t shrink in the washer but it hasn’t. The weight is fine. I wore it in the cold when I took my dog for a walk once when it was a bit windy and cold but the hoodie kept me warm and I wasn’t cold at all because it’s like a blanket inside hugging you around to keep you warm. I’m planning on buying more of these in the future. The size is great. Everything is great about the hoodie.,

It is thick. I work in a very old building with poor heating and I am always cold. The lining is a very soft Sherpa. I was worried about the texture because I am hypersensitive. I have washed it a few times and it is still very nice. I also bought a zip up hoodie and it is the same for that one too. It is still very soft. The color is true to the picture it is pretty. I will be getting more. It is a great price too. There is no shrinkage. This is a different kind of material that would not shrink. There is plenty of room in the arms to wear something underneath I wear a couple layers. I got a size medium and I had plenty of room and that is my normal size. I would say they run a little big if you are looking for something that is slim fitting.,

I'm from SoCal and have health conditions that make me very sensitive to cold for perspective sake. I'm a big shivering wimp at anything under 70*F basically, -6* was way out of my comfort zone! 🥶 This was so warm and comfy and literally made the trip bearable. They are thick enough that a cold wind doesn't really go through the fabric too. Loved them so much I bought 2 more when I got home. I've had them for a year now and they've held up fantastically. Regularly machine wash them on warm water heavy cycles with everything else and dry on high heat. No shrinkage, no fading, no piling, and the lining is as soft and fluffy as the day I bought them. The drawstring on the hood is extra wide and nearly impossible to slide through the grommets so I've never lost a drawstring on these either. For a simple, solid, hoodie I actually am surprised at how often I get complimented on them (the quality is obvious) and people can't believe it when I tell them they're only $25-30. My kids are always trying to steal them. For the price I'm extremely impressed and highly recommend these! They run true to size (I'm 5""4' 140lbs and got size M, maybe go up a size if you like a much looser fit or want to layer a lot under). Get them in as many colors as you can afford!",23
