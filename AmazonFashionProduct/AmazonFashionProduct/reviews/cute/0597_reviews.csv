I think they'd fit better length-wise if I was shorter.  They is HARDLY ANY ELASTICITY at the top. They do not have a band to keep them up and are held up by the thickness of your calves alone. If you have thinner calves, they'll fall down a lot probably. I really wish they did, but they're 10 dollars so its understandable I guess.  So far I've worn them for about 3 hours around the house and they haven't fallen down once, but they do get lower. In the video, I jump up and down and try to shake them off, but they never fall down fully :)!!  In the pictures I tucked the bottom (not very) because I don't particularly like the roll at the end. In the video I did not tuck them in.  Summary: + Warm enough, knit. Look cute and make me happy. Stayed up for 3 hours, won't fall even when I'm jumping around. - Not puffy enough at the bottom like in the pictures, so I wish they were longer. Barely stay up because no elastic.",4
