I have been scouring the internet for a good roller rabbit dupe that will ship to Canada and I think this is the one. When I first bought this I had no idea which size to buy because the reviews on whether to size up or size down were pretty much split right down the middle. I decided on an XS because if it ended up being a bit too big I could just throw it in the dryer. So, for reference, I'm 5ft tall, have a 28-inch bust, a 23-inch waist, and the XS fits me perfectly. The shorts are quite high-waisted and have a length of 13 inches from the bottom of the shorts to the top of the waistband, if you're not super into high-waisted stuff like me you can roll down the waistband without it looking weird. The inseam/length of the shorts part is around 3 inches and the waistband is 23in without being stretched. The waistband is super stretchy and can probably fit a waist up to 26in comfortably (it can stretch more but probably wouldn't be too comfy). The PJ top has a 22.8-inch length measuring from the shoulder seam to the bottom of the top, 38 inches around the chest, and the sleeves are 7.2 inches long measuring from the shoulder seam. The top fits slightly oversized for me but that's the look I was going for so it fit great. Overall, the fabric quality is nice, I can't tell what the fabric is but it's soft, and it kind of feels as if you mixed cotton and silk. The pattern is printed on but it's not blurry or anything, I will say though, I think the size of the monkey is bigger than the originals. I'm not sure how big it is on the original PJs, but on these its about 2 inches long. Anyways, hope this helped y'all, I'll def be buying more colours",4
