I’m 36B bra size. The bra doesn’t have any way to adjust the straps so I ordered a size up. I think a large would probably have the wrong size cup for me. Ultimately, the material feels nice but it seems like the kind that will permanently smell like BO very quickly no matter how clean and diligent you are about it. It’s very tight around my rib cage, to the point of leaving marks that burn when I take it off. While not a total waste of money, I wouldn’t recommend this product.",

My breasts nursed for 6 years and are very stretched.  Sure, with a good bra they lift and fill out, but bras are torture.  I’m always searching for a good bralette. I hate the padding, thick binding straps and wires of supportive bras.  And bralettes, I fall out of them. This bra is a pleasant surprise.  It’s minimal with thin straps and it holds me up enough and I don’t fall out of it with moderate movement.  It does have swimsuit top vibes. Ive used it for lounging, housecleaning, errands, yoga and going out.  I see myself wearing it to the beach too.  I’m so pleased.  I immediately purchased more.  Finally a minimal bralette that holds me, without compression, separates the breasts, and the straps feel soft and not restricting.  Looks great with open back clothes.  Love this bra.  This design in an organic cotton stretch would be the holy grail (just had to put that out there).",
