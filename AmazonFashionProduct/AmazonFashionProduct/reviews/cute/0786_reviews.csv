I’m really hoping it doesn’t shrink, because if it doesn’t, it will be my new favorite.  Buying another in a different color, but as soon as I wash the first one - if it shrinks - the new color will be sent back.  So comfy and cozy, love the side slits for my ample hips (😝), and I probably could have gotten one size smaller, but love the roomy fit of one size larger too much to return for anything smaller. 🥰If it doesn’t shrink, Hanes definitely needs to make these in a lot bigger color selection, because it’s so hard to find sweatshirts like these for women that don’t strangle your midsection as a heavier woman.",

Just your basic Hanes Fleece Hoodie. We bought these from the time I was a kid for the fall and then to have in school for PE class. It’s still the same hasn’t changed. Which can be a good thing considering you know what to expect. They don’t shrink, they last long, they keep you warm, almost too warm after you’ve run the track for gym class but also absorbs the sweat and keeps you warm thereafter. The weight isn’t too heavy but the range of colors is quite limited. I would say the value for the money of what your spending for the quality of the merchendise is a good deal. You can also find matching pants.",

It's got a loose, slouchy fit, making it perfect for lounging around the house - but this is in no way fitted, so think of it as a casual garment that fills the role of an old band hoodie rather than as a fashion statement.  The listing promises a kanga pocket, and as far as I can tell, that isn't present here. The photos in the listing are more accurate to what I received than the listing text, so I'd go by the visuals instead.  With a pocket, this would have been five stars, but as is, it's still an okay hoodie. It hasn't become a favorite, though, and I probably wouldn't order this again.",
