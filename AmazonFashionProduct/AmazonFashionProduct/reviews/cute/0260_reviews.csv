Every Woman,Fun and Warm But Poor Quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWRQI2R0MN8LD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBDPTZHL,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Color: 1-khakiSize: Large,,"This sweater is fun and cheerful to wear.  It is bulky and very warm.  The sleeves are really long, but the body is too short.  The quality isn't great - the colored yarn used for the flowers bleeds through creating faint colored stripes where the flowers are.  This isn't that noticable from a distance but is obvious up close.So it's fun to throw on to run errands or such, but I wouldn't wear it to gatherings.",

The plus is that is warm. I was highly disappointed.",

Be careful to not pick it like I did with my bracelet as soon as I unpacked it. Do note that in certain lighting, you can see through the white and blue parts to see the pink and red yarn. It doesn’t bother me but I know some people it might, so maybe get one of the darker shades to avoid that. I even love the print of the inside of the sweater.",
