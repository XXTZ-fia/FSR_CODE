The top arrived in a clear plastic bag. Upon opening the bag, I did not noticHenry funky smell. The fabric is not very soft but not rough or scratchy. The stitching seems even inside and out, with no loose strings.  The weather is still hot in California, so my wife hasn't worn it out yet.

Me,Very cozy. Nice material.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NZS3X84GBQRT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBLNLY7V,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 6, 2024",Color: GreySize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I love a good hoodie/sweatshirt and I've gotten some pretty awesome pieces from Trendy Queen in the past, so I jumped on this as soon as I saw it. To be fair (and honest) you really can't beat the price, so I ordered the gray and the white/blue.  The sweatshirts arrived quick, vaccum packed in a plastic bag. There were some slight wrinkles when I took them out, but no strange odors. I wash everything before wear, so straight to the machine this went, and it only got better from there. I highly recommend washing this before wear because it's just a tiny but stiff at first, but immediately gets nice and soft/relaxed once washed. I washed on a regular cycle/warm water then tumble dried on medium until it was dry.  The material is really nice. It is medium to medium-thick, super soft and nice and cozy/toasty warm. The outer face doesn't pill. Inside, this is a soft fleece sweatshirt, so it (the inside) does get a bit knotty/lumpy, but it's nothing unusual or uncomfortable. The cuffs, bottom hem and collar are very soft, have good stretch and don't get warped or stretched out of shape. They don't have that cheep, shiny polyester look/feel to them either (which I loathe). I actually dislike polyester all around and usually avoid it like the plague. Even though this is 50% cotton, 50% polyester, you don't get that cheep feeling or roughness to this at all. It feels soft and wears like an excellent quality cotton sweatshirt, but luckily can withstand the dryer and not shrink.  The construction is simple, but we'll executed. This has strong/studry stitching and surges, even cuts and hems. There are no loose or rogue threads anywhere on either sweatshirt.  I love a good oversized sweatshirt and I planned on 'sharing' these with my daughter. I am 5'7"", 127lbs and 34B. She is 5'8"", 150lbs, 36B with an athletic, long, lean build. I went with a size L. It is pretty massive on me, fitting more like a dress. I'm all for oversized, but the large is just too large. It fits my daughter perfect- nice and roomy and relaxed.  Seeing the price is so reasonable, I decided to order ANOTHER set of sweatshirts, same colors, in a Medium for myself. I'll let my daughter keep the larges because she too loves this sweatshirt.  It's easy, comfy and well made- you can't go wrong with these!",14
Charonna,Decent sweatshirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WWJ1ZHVCGUY1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBLNLY7V,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 5, 2024",Color: Coffee GreySize: Large,,"I did not find this sweatshirt to fit or look as pictured.  The colors are not true to the pic and barely contrast at all.  This is a light beige, not at all a coffee gray, with cream trim.  That said, the seams match up and are well sewn.  This can be worn with leggings or jeans, for fall or winter.  It is long, just butt covering.  The fabric is a decently thicker, average sweatshirt material.  The inside is very soft.  Over all the fit is OK, slightly baggy.  It does not appear to be very oversized, as pictured.  I bought my regular size, but wish I sized up.  I assume it will shrink some in the wash, based on “cold wash” in the description.  For a 40% off coupon, this is a good buy.",3
