Unfortunately, I encountered several issues:  Inconsistent Fabric Quality: The fabric thickness varied significantly between the two sizes. One shirt had a lighter material, while the other was much thicker and felt more substantial. While I liked both, one I could only wear in the winter, while the other could work year-round. This inconsistency was disappointing and made it hard to gauge the overall quality of the product.  Poor Craftsmanship: After just a couple of wears, the thread along the bottom seam of one shirt began to unravel, which was frustrating and left the shirt looking sloppy.  Fit Issues: The shirt is not long and the Med was too short for my preference. The Large was better. It's definitely not ideal for those looking for a longer, more flattering silhouette.  While the style and collared V-neck design are nice in theory, the quality and fit issues make this a product I cannot highly recommend.",

It also has a nice stretch and you won’t have to worry about your bra shining through the material in photos. Material is soft and thick, but thick in a good way. This top stands alone. You don’t need to layer on top of it. This will be great for fall/winter occasions when you take your jacket off and just have this top underneath. It’s basically a collared sweater. I love it. I would size up if you’re between sizes. But is has great stretch if u want the body con look or to tuck into a skirt or pant pick your true size, maybe even even 1 size down. But that’s if you want the body suit effect. Which is nice because the fabric has great coverage. May need to iron/steam after being packed and shipped.",20

The quality is nice and the top wasn't wrinkled when it came out of the package.  I recommend sizing up a few sizes if you don't want a fitted look.  Also, the bust is quite snug for those ladies who need extra room up top.  It's a solid, versatile top and it can be worn casually or at the office on casual Fridays, etc.  You could also easily dress it up with some nice slacks.",2

There is a significant difference and the shirt I received (L) is just a bit too snug. I wish I had ordered the XL.  Other than that, the shirt is superb. It is extremely soft. It's stretchy, too.
