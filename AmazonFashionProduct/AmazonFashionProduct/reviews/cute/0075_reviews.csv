rainier d kanhai,Tall and busty girl friendly,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWFP1VR6G74PM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS92X2HK,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"As a women who is 6' with 34 DDD's I was ecstatic when I tried this on and it fit like a glove. It's long enough to fully fit the torso and doesn't have that weird gap under the bust, it curves to your body and is long enough in the clasp area that your lady parts are not being m*rdered. It's double lined in the bust area as well so for those that would want to go braless it seems like it would give good coverage and keeps the cherries where they need to be. I put like 6 other colors on my wishlist 😂",

The feel and quality are atrocious and the snap closure is done backwards, so that the snaps are inside and irritate you. Worse, I’m not a very sweaty person but it’s so absorbent that I had four inch long lines of sweat just under my boobs within two hours of wearing it, in 65 degree weather. The top is also only partially lined, with the liner extending about a third of the way down from the neckline. In the medium size on my DD chest this very visible line hit in the worst possible spot. The liner is only attached on the top and side seams so this issue may have been anticipated but wasn’t fixed.  I will never wear it again and it was a waste of money.",

I love how soft it is and that it’s double lined. The only reasons it’s not getting 5 stars is because some of the colors in the product pictures are a bit misleading. One other note is that I also bought these for my sister. I got her a large and the body suit was VERY long on her. She’s 5’2”. I’m also 5’2” and the small fits me fine. The larger sizes might be too long if you’re on the shorter side,

BUT…. The one thing I don’t like is the second layer on the inside of the bodysuit isn’t long enough. It seems like it was made for people to wear only high waisted bottoms with. For that reason… it gets a 4 star review. It fits very nicely and snug but not too tight at all. Not for tummy control. I love high neck. Super cute. This was my first bodysuit purchase and it’s been better than the ones I have now found in the store. Good value for the cost,

I am a medium and I don't think it is a matter of sizing down it just looks a little disproportional and you can even see it in the other reviews with pictures. So I'm bummed that the body doesn't lay flat, I think I need to take it in under the armpit or just live with it gaping a bit.

The white color will show everything. You can definitely see my nip shape through it, so if it's cold, everyone will know.

No bra necessary, which is so nice for thicker girls because bra lines can just be annoying.  The crotch area is a little thick, I can def feel it but it’s not the worst. Thong style in the back so hope you’re ready for that. The material is breathable and stretchy but a STRONG stretchy. It isn’t thin if flimsy by any means.  All in all 11/10, get it.",17
