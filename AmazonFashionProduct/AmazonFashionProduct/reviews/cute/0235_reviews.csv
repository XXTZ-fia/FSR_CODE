Very unsatisfactory given a mom's lack of time to ""futz"" with tying a headband on the baby and tying the belt.  When I saw the ad, I assumed that the headband would just slip on (as most others do) and that the belt was attached to the pants.",

Amazon Customer,The hair bow is not premade!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32S7SD9FWJM80/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B5SVG5PJ,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 23, 2024",Size: 3-6 MonthsColor: Daisy Apricot,Verified Purchase,Just be aware that the hair bow is just a long tie that you tie around the baby's head.  It's not an actual bow with an elastic headband.  Probably won't stay on.  Not sure I'm going to include it with the gift.  Also the pants have belt loops and another tie around the waist.  VERY wrinkled fabric!  Had to iron the tie and bows to uncurl them after coming out of the dryer.  Too much work for a new mom!  Would not recommend for new moms.,

I thought it was super cute but in person it looks so cheaply made. The fabric is scratchy and wouldn't feel comfortable for a baby I'd imagine, let alone the person holding the baby.
