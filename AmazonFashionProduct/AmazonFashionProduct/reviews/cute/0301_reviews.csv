The colour and feel of this sweater is divine. It’s heavy and expensive feeling. It’s soooo soft. The quality is truly impressive for the price!  I washed it immediately before wearing and the sweater came out in perfect condition, just a smaller (and better) fit!  I will say the only thing I wish was that it was slightly less boxy looking and had a bit more shape but overall I’m very impressed! It’s a cozy but luxe sweater!",11
