She says it is very comfortable to wear daily, and the fabric is lightweight, soft, and breathable, making it perfect for summer wear. The top is versatile enough to wear for casual occasions and work events. The color of the top is as advertised in the product photos, and the slip-over design makes it easy to wear as there are no buttons, zippers, or snaps. The seams are all well-sewn, and the hems are even, which is a sign of good craftsmanship. It fits as expected in my wife's usual size.  My wife washed the top on the regular cycle and medium dryer cycle, and the size and color have stayed the same. The product description is accurate, and I received it in two days with no issues. I would definitely get it again, and she wants additional colors.",

Freds Mom,"Cute top, dressy, puff sleeves with small front pleats.

The fabric isn't one of my favorites, 60% polyester, 35% rayon, 5% Spandex, and I worry this might be too hot for a southern summer, but we'll see. So far, so good.  This is a dressy summer top with pleats in the front and puff sleeves, and you could dress it up or down a little bit. It's comfortable, fits true to size, but there's no extra fabric or ""give"" to the shirt. I do like that it has 5% Spandex in the fabric, but a polyester and rayon combination isn't one of my summer favorites. Still, I ordered the top, so we'll give it a chance.  You can machine wash this, but it needs to hang to dry. The seller tells us it will dry quickly, and I believe it will because the fabric is fairly thin. It isn't see-through, but it is thin, as a dressy summer top would normally be.  My official bargain sniffer, my Labrador, has just rushed in to tell me that this top is already 7% off, and now it has a $3 coupon. The top doesn't look like something you'd get at this price point; it's nicely made and the fabric, while not my favorite, is okay.  I would recommend this top for anyone who works in an environment where it would be appropriate and for slightly dressy places like going to the doctor. It fits true to size, but I feel these fabrics are going to be pretty hot in the south in summertime. Then again, I can't predict the future, so I will update my review as soon as the hellacious heat arrives.",

The seams all lay flat and I noted no loose threads.My wife likes the details around the crewneck, the pleating gives a plain khaki shirt a little something extra.  She also likes the way the puffy sleeves elevate the look.  This is a shirt that can be worn with leggings as it is a bit on the long side.  I would say you could size down in this particular shirt.The cuffs on the sleeves have some stretch so it should fit a variety of body types.
