Jan,Good for tractor lovers,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBKFLGVEZ7V06/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB61JDT1,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Color: Fuzzy Tractor-apricotSize: 2-3T,,"My 2 yr old is obsessed with tractors and this set was a hit. The top fit well, but the pants were too long. The pants actually fit my thinner 3 yr old better, so I split the set up between my kids. The material for the set is ok. It's not lined and the fabric is a bit rough, but I think it's fine as toddler play clothes.",
lesui_family,Adorable boy outfit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23ADV6CDTQ7Z0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB61JDT1,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: Fuzzy Tractor-apricotSize: 2-3T,,My cutie looks so nice in this outfit.

Haley,So cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Y5LIC85EEYZX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB61JDT1,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 2, 2025",Color: Apricot-old Macdonald Had a FarmSize: 0-6 Months,,"Got this outfit for a baby shower gift, and it is so cute!!! I forgot to snap a picture of it before wrapping it up, but it is true to the pictures, though it did need a good steaming after unpacking it to smooth out the wrinkles. The material is lightweight and pretty thin, so not the warmest. But it is soft and feels like good quality. I'd just say it will need some layering for colder climates. I got the size 0-6 months and it looks true to size as well. So excited to gift this outfit! It is seriously adorable!",

The outside is decent, but the inside feels very cheap; you can feel the polyester, and it feels rough. It could work if paired with cotton winter underwear. It is well made and seems durable. I loved the tractor embroidery and the cut of the pants.",
