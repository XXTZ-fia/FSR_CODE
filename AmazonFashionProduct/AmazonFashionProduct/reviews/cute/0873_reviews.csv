I read all the reviews, and it seemed like a lot of people sized up for that oversized off the shoulder look. I’m 5’1” 135, I ordered a large thinking I would need to size up, but a medium would have been better. The large is very wide on me, and a little too long. Maybe for a beach cover up that fit would work, but as a top with jeans and a tank, order your reg size and it will sill have a nice flow and fall just off the shoulder",
