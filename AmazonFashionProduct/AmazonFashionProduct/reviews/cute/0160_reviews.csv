My view of the different styles: Thong style— crotch is too long and stretchy Brief style— again, too big and stretchy (but then again I have no butt LOL so take that as you will) Short style— could be shorter but pulling/rolling them up doesn’t effect the clean lines There’s a noticeable difference with these on but they’re not constricting (except maybe the first time you wear them). I order a size down. Don’t put on fresh out of the shower unless you like a challenge hahaha  Also, I’ve purchased only the light tan and black. The black has always been much thicker/sturdier than the tan… I’ve ripped all the tan ones putting them on, but none of the black ones. Also, the strap adjusters stay in place better with the black ones— the tan ones are always slipping. Idk about other colors or if that’s just a “me” thing, but I want to share my findings",

I love the clasps in the crotch area which are just like a bra strap, not snaps like other body suits that always come unsnapped at the most inopportune times. That being said, the width of the body suit in the crotch area is the same as a bra strap which basically cuts into your lady parts all day long! Even as the body suit comes around the front towards the pelvic area it is very narrow and cuts into your private area. I have a petite frame, 5ft tall and 125lbs, I wear a small and I have a short torso. I even ordered a medium thinking maybe it would be better but it made no difference. I don’t wear thongs so I was looking for full coverage like normal underwear would be. This is unfortunate because it’s so uncomfortable I will be replacing the one I have with a different brand. It has great reviews which is why I bought this one but for me this is a deal breaker.",
