She's about average height for her age and we find these to be a bit large, but that's OK since she can roll up the cuffs and grow into them.  They're soft, they go with just about everything, and they double as both everyday wear and pajama bottoms.  A great value.",

Now that the weather is turning colder, I need to stock up with something she'll actually wear. This three pack works well. She's sort of inbetween sizes, so I sized down this time because she's really slim and gets frustrated with baggy waists. The waist size on the 8 is perfect without needing the drawstring, but either way, I'm glad that the drawstring is adjustable rather than decorative. We might need that once these are handed down to her sisters. The length is a smidge short when she moves, otherwise it sits perfectly at her ankle. It's fine for her. She'll probably end up wearing the lighter color ones for pajama bottoms anyways. I'm still saying the sizing is as expected since I know we sized down.  Best feature: functional pockets!",

They’re a little big on her so I’d say they run true to size. They’re good quality, nice strong elastic waist. The material is kind of like a sweatpants but not thick at all. They were a little long on her since I sized up one so I rolled the waistband and she is able to wear them. She says they’re loose and comfy. I would recommend these! Good quality.",

She’s short for her age but the elastic on the ankles fits well so she has room to grow into these. The waistband fits a little snug at first so we had to stretch them a little bit first. Best part about this set is it’s so easy to mix and match tops with. The font on the pants is multicolor so really any shirt can pair well with them.,
