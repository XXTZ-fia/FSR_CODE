I’m a fairly good lookin’ dude and these easily take me up a notch. Now, I do shave my head and have a few fuzzies stuck to my stubble when I take them off, but it’s a small price to pay for the wonderment that is this crew neck.",

I have a heat pump that STRUGGLES to produce heat below 40 degrees.  Currently the outdoor temp is 23 degrees.  The aux heat kicks in and the electric meter spins.  BTW I really dislike heat pumps.  I did not really wear this sweatshirt much after I bought it.  I have my favorite 30+ year old sweatshirt that I wore most of the time.  I decided to give this one a go this year...  I am sorry to say it is pilling all over.  Everywhere the arms touch on the body is pilling.  Under the arms is really bad.  I am guessing it is because there is only 50% cotton in it vs the 30+ year old sweatshirt is a 100% cotton.  It does not have a pill anywhere on it.  Anyway I am disappointed with how this sweatshirt is wearing.  I would not buy this item again.,
