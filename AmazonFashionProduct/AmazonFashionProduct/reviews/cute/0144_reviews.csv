This product is terrible. All the banks were dried out. The pencils do not work neither does the chalk. Do not buy this unless you want to waste your money.,Not as pictured,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12P1DTTAGP262/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7LXGD9L,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 3, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,The printed image is SUPER bright NOT faded at all much to my daughter’s disliking. Wanted what she had seen in the advertisement. Also there’s not black extension under the sleeves which it looks like are part of the shirt. It’s also VERY thin fabric. Not worth $22 or whatever you charged me for it. Bummer.,
