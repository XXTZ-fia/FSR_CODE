Kendra,Super Comfy.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1521EEAE0FA6L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP97K7D6,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Color: WineredSize: Large,,"Nice soft material, and very comfortable. I usually wear a large and this fit pretty true to size, perhaps a little more roomy than most. And I have to admit that I really love the wine red color. I would say it's more of a dark rose than wine, but still super pretty. Very happy with this shirt.",
H.M.,"Collects fibers, layering only (black, small)",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RO67KKWEG1HLU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP97K7D6,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Small,,"I purchased this t-shirt to wear as a layering shirt under sweaters and after receiving it, I'm glad I didn't buy it thinking I'd wear it by itself. I like the fit and the style, the v-neck detail is nice too, however, I'm not a fan of the fabric. Before washing it, it felt kind of like a stretchy workout tee, after washing it, it feels completely different, which is fine, but now it collects every single hair and fiber near it. And everything shows up on the black fabric. I also wasn't sure if the cuffed sleeves were folded for the listing pictures or if the sleeves came that way. The sleeves are cuffed and sewn. I normally wear a medium and purchased the small, which fits how I want it to.  This would be a three star item if I was planning to wear this t-shirt alone, but it'll work great for layering.",
Lis,soft and comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JFM0O73LFSQ3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP97K7D6,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Color: LightgreenSize: Medium,,This is a soft and comfortable t-shirt.

Aam,A little thin but good value,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MLEW2SA0XOEL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP97K7D6,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Medium,,"I’d buy this in multiple colors just because it’s a good length and I love a v-neck. However, the material is a bit thin, so wear coordinating undergarments!",
Michele m.,Comfortable t-shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26UDI544OEDAS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP97K7D6,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: WineredSize: X-Large,,I like the length of this tshirt on my arms and torso. It doesn't ride up and is a flattering fit. The color was just as advertised and the material is soft and not itchy at all. A very comfortable tshirt I will order more of.,
WSMT,Nice v-neck top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HGE077I0DC43/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP97K7D6,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Color: WineredSize: X-Large,,"True to size, nice material. This is a nice v-neck design with a good sleeve length (might be a bit short for some, but it's definitely an actual sleeve and not a cap). Would prefer a little longer length though it does it below the waist. Very stretchy soft material. The color isn't really a deep wine, it's more like a heathered wine - very pretty though. True to size.",

The style and color is exactly as pictured. The material is soft and I found no defects. The size is exactly right and matches the chart on this page. I wish it came it more colors.,

The material is comfortable and light, making it breathable in the summer months.  The fabric is a little thin, so it's perfect for layering.  The stitching is really well done and the fit is true to size and flattering.  Overall, it's a really nice comfortable shirt!",
Brent Duncan,Nice quality but runs large!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8U9ZDDFQDEW7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP97K7D6,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Color: LightgreenSize: Small,,"This top is very nice, well made and comfortable!  The only thing to know is that it runs a little on the larger side, so I’d advise ordering a size smaller than your normal size.  Otherwise it’s great!",
Michelle Cohen,Soft and comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CTPPDJVDD2OS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP97K7D6,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Color: WineredSize: Large,,"This V-neck tee is wonderfully soft. The fabric is good quality -- it's stretchy and roomy. The thick border around the V-neck is nicer than your average V-neck. This is a comfortable tee at a very good price. I normally wear a size 12. I ordered a size large and it fits well. The only thing I would change is I would get the white or black tee instead of the wine colored one that I got. The wine color is fine, but this fabric shows sweat stains easily. The white or back version wouldn't show it as easily.",
Kerry L. Thomas,I love it!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28O57AG1N7KES/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP97K7D6,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Large,,"This shirt is even better than I expected.

The color is also pure white, not yellowish white. I hesitate to wear white because I'm afraid it will get dirty, but this T-shirt is inexpensive, so I feel I can wear it to my heart's content. It seems like it can be easily matched with a variety of outfits.",
Jen S,Classic V Neck,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMFLGKZHMNX51/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP97K7D6,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: WhiteSize: Small,,I like crisp white casual tops for an every day look. This one is made of fairly thick material that is not see through. The sleeves have a nice shape that gives the shirt alot more style than a traditional type T-shirt. I ordered a small which is my normal size.  This does have a loose fit to it which is what I prefer. Comfortable to wear all day whether lounging around or going out to brunch. Versatile and trendy.,
LOLA,Nice t shirt!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R247WZ5A153631/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP97K7D6,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Color: LightgreenSize: Large,,This v neck tshirt is nice and thick and seems to be good quality. It’s thicker than other tshirts I have and feels like it will wash and dry well.  I think it’s true to size and hangs nicely without being too clingy.  I highly recommend this tshirt!,
