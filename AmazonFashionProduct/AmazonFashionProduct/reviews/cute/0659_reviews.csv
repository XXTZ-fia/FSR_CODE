It was pretty much a nicer version of cotton. The material was rigid and not very stretchy or comfortable/soft. I also thought the style of the shirt did not look right. The “off the shoulder” look was tacky and messy looking in my opinion. I am 38G and the XL fit my body well but gave my chest the “flat boob” effect because it was a little too tight in the chest area. It also gave me terrible armpit fat with my strapless bra on. Will be returning.,

Now I have to just suck it up and wash it and hope that it is fine because I need to wear it today. But it smelled like arm pits. Bad. Hopefully the smell comes out. I’m not sure who inspects products to be sure they can be sold again, but Amazon missed this one.  Otherwise though, I love the shirt. I’m 5’10 about 160lvs and wear a 34G.
