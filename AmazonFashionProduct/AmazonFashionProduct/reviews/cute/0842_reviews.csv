I consider myself a hoodie hoarder. I have more than I actually can believe bc I just keep buying them. But don't mistake that for buying or liking just any Ole hoodie. I'm very picky. 1st ill start by saying the claims about this being cheap material- wrong. I've made the mistake of buying cheap ones b4 and this is NOT one of those. 2nd-No There is NO kangaroo pocket. But it also does not advertise there being one. There is not one shown on the stock pics either. So those docking a star on account of THEIR mistake of buying a hoodie without a pocket is ridiculous. Reading is fundamental, folks. 3rd- oversized?! Yes. Very oversized. I am 5'7 162lbs and I ordered a SMALL. It fits like an oversized medium. It falls and just grazes the bottom of my booty. I'm fine with it. But unless you're wanting this to wear like a dress on you, I'd suggest sizing down. I actually had to double check the size on the tag when I pulled it out bc it looked a lot bigger than a small. But I love it. I just personally wouldn't size up or even get it in your normal size unless you truly want it extremely baggy/big. 4th- There are no hoodie strings which I don't mind either way. But if that's something you want- just know this doesn't have them. The hood is perfect and covers my head well and I've got a lot of curly hair. 5th-sleeve length is perfect. Not short and I've Def got longer arms. And not too long. I don't like when they hang and get in the way and drag in or on things and get dingey dirty. I actually am writing this as I'm sitting in my car about to go into the gym and it's about 34° and it kept me warm when I went out to start my car and let my dogs out. I can't find a single thing I don't like about it. I've not washed it yet but I've several other sweatshirts/items from this brand and haven't had any issue with fading or shrinking. If I do- I'll be back to edit my review to add that but I truly don't forsee there being an issue. But come on- stop taking stars off for garments not having things that they literally don't advertise having!!! AGAIN-This does NOT HAVE a kangaroo pocket. If you want that- look elsewhere. This brand has them- I know bc I have them!!! Don't buy this knowing that then give 3 or 4 stars saying it's bc no pockets. Make it make sense!!!! Oh and the price point is perfect. Great price for a quality, nice fitting sweatshirt with a hood that if taken care of will last several seasons. I love it. ❤️",14
