Sadie F,Very soft and pretty!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1T2ZW0WSJKCJN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3X84Q3V,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 17, 2024",Size: 12-18 MonthsColor: Cream White,,"I got this for my daughter to use under her Hedwig wings for Halloween. The ""cream white"" color is a true white, and I was easily able to cut the brown thread for the flower centers out of the sweater, without damaging any of the other stitching. The sweater runs a little bit big, so while the 12-18m size looked oversized on my 18m daughter back in October, it still looks great now that she's grown a bit and is almost 2yo. It's about the same size as Old Navy 2T, but it's forgiving if it's a little big since oversized sweaters are common now. The sweater washes well, and it still looks almost new after months of use. Food stains come right out with a little stain remover, and there's no pilling or other visible fabric wear, even though I dry it in the dryer instead of laying it flat to dry. Overall this is a great sweater that I would happily get again!",
