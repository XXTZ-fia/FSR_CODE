I’m normally a medium but I ordered a large because I knew I’d just be wearing them to bed and I like a looser pajama bottom. The large size feels like a small after washing!,

You will need to size up (I am a small and purchased a large) if you want them alittle baggy and comfortable. Do not dry them in the dryer. I wear the navy blue pelican boxers to the beach all the time.,

It still was a bit snug. I should have ordered two sizes up. Now that is going to depend how you like it to fit. The cotton can’t be beat as far as being cool for summer. Pretty prints.,

Well, that's not all she wrote, she did say this value pack of all cotton lounge boxer shorts are very cute, and they're soft, and they're comfortable to wear, and the colors are rich and bold but yet not overwhelming, and these boxers are well made with no loose strings or uneven seams.... and then as she was walking away she added... ""great product"".  And that was that.",3
ILoveMyKids,I like these! Size up if you have curves - these aren't necessarily forgiving.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FS52YO00R98P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGGDY32C,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 16, 2024",Color: 3pcs-flamingos/Watercolor Painting/FlowersSize: Small,,"If you're curious about the texture of these boxers for women - picture old school, standard boxers for men. These are stiffer and hardier and kinda more like cotton shorts material than something you'd want to wear without undies underneath for comfort. That said, I love the style and simplicity of these, especially when I'm wearing nightshirts or tanks on the shorter side and just need a little more coverage when it's night time/bedtime and I'm around other people in the house or lounging around in the mornings with the possibility of someone seeing me. I would say these run fairly true to size at first blush, BUT they are not very forgiving and that can be problematic for most women. I am around a size 4 and ordered the Small, and they fit just right - but barely, and I have a rather flat bum these days. They're not overly baggy and they're on the short side - and I definitely would not want them any smaller at all. In fact, I'd probably be more comfortable in the Medium - and again, that's at a size 4. These don't necessarily have much stretch and give to them outside of the waistband overall, and that can be an issue for women as we are all shaped differently around the hips/bum area and often need some sort of give to account for curves. While these fit me fine for now, I can completely understand others with different shapes and sizes having a hard time with these due to this lack of stretch/give, and I would say they run on the small side and to size up. I do love the prints on these and they wash and dry easily over and over with no issues whatsoever - so they're pretty hardy and I expect them to last a long time. Depending on what you're looking for, YMMV.",

Heather_Raye,Super cute!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JF1LJT2Q55TK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGGDY32C,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 11, 2024",Color: 3pcs-flamingos/Watercolor Painting/FlowersSize: Small,,"It has an elastic waistband which is nice and helps make them more comfortable. If you have a larger butt though you may wanna size up because there’s zero stretch obviously in the cotton. Maybe I won’t steal my hubbys anymore, but probably will lol. I like how cozy they are for lounging or sleeping in. I’m 5’4 weigh 125 with a 25 in waist and got a size small which fit me nicely. I love the variety of designs as well. My butt does slightly hang out of them. Also being that they’re cotton they may shrink too. I honestly love these!",6
