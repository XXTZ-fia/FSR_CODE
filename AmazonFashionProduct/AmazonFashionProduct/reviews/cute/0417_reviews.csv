It would drive me insane so I would never wear it.  It's a bummer because it's a stunning sweater.  The material did not feel itchy as others had mentioned.  Would be great if you lived in an area that didn't have as much dry winter air (like Texas).",

So I like all my tops to be loose. the hole for the head was so small that I had to squeeze so hard to get the hole to stretch around my tiny head.

It is a heavier sweater but not heavy enough to go without a coat in 40 or colder temperatures which depends on each individuals tolerance of cold. I am 5’5 and weigh 171 lbs. I typically order a 2X because I love my clothing baggie. After reading other reviews I thought I’d order XL which fit comfortably on me. I did not find it to be overly baggie as other reviews stated. I found it fit like an XL with a little extra length in sleeves. It goes below my waist and cover part of my butt but not as overly sized as I had hoped. I personally wouldn’t feel comfortable wearing leggings with it considering the length. I wished I would have gotten the 2X but I’m keeping the XL because it fits very nicely and is loose but not ridiculously loose that I like.,2
