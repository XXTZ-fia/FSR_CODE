Very comfortable and doesn’t wear like a nursing bra. If you need a lot of support you won’t find that in this bra, but it is sufficient support for my size and excellent materials. I like how the cups are sewn in so they don’t shift or fall out but can be slightly removed for easily cleaning all that milk leakage out #iykyk",

The material isn’t super thick, but I’m not really wearing anything tight at this point, so that’s not a big deal. However, the few hours that I get to sleep at night, I wake up soaked in milk. I’m quite literally falling out of the cups, making it impossible for the breast pads to catch any milk.",

The cup size fits perfect but the band is a little tight. Definitely ordering more in a large !,
Gabby Johnson-Caler,Amazing Bra,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KKPTL76ZVQHY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBPLXKX4,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Color: BeigeSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"I love the quality of this bra, it’s not thick like some nursing bras to where you see the outlines through a fitted top but it’s not so thin that your nips just poke out. It holds you in place and doesn’t make you look like you have a uni-boob. It’s easy to put on and pull down the straps to nurse or pump, it’s also easy to get back off. The pads inside also don’t shift around like most nursing bras do which is a bonus. I’d say that overall it is worth it for the price!",

It keeps wrinkling up in the back. The back strap keeps unhooking itself so I keep having to take off my entire shirt to rehook the back of the strap.

Lastly, the straps have started coming off where they hook to the band, literally just happened while I was sitting on the couch not moving. I have 4 of these bras and experience the same issue on them all. I also measured multiple times to ensure I ordered the correct size.  For reference I have a smaller band size and large cup size and ordered an XL. This could be an issue for my body type.",

As a breastfeeding mom, finding a bra that provides support while being easy to use is a game-changer, and this one delivers on all fronts.  The material is incredibly soft and breathable, making it perfect for all-day wear. It’s gentle on the skin, which is especially important for sensitive areas during nursing. The straps are adjustable, and the band feels snug but not restrictive, offering just the right amount of support without digging in.  One of the best features is how easy it is to nurse while wearing this bra. The clips are simple to open and close with one hand, which makes feeding your baby much more manageable, especially during nighttime feedings. The bra also has removable padding, which is a nice touch for added convenience and customization.  Even though it’s designed for nursing, the bra still offers solid support. It gives good lift and helps maintain a flattering shape without being overly structured or uncomfortable. I feel secure and supported throughout the day, whether I’m at home or out and about.  I love that the Momcozy Nursing Bra comes in various colors, so you can easily find one to match your style or wardrobe. It’s discreet enough to wear under regular clothes and looks sleek, not bulky.  If you’re a nursing mom looking for comfort, support, and practicality, I highly recommend the Momcozy Nursing Bra. It makes breastfeeding so much easier and more comfortable, without sacrificing style or support. A great addition to any nursing mom’s wardrobe!",

I wanted a nursing bra that didn’t look like it was only built for lounging around on a Friday night with friends or going for a quick jog. I wanted a comfortable bra with some structure. However, when I put this bra on for the 5th time or so, I threw a tank top over it and then a long sleeve. Somewhere along the way, I felt a small pop as the strap slid out of the little loop. Since I’m a “house on fire” kind of mom, I didn’t have time to fix it and had to deal with it for most of the morning. I thought it was just a mistake on my part until it happened again the next time I put it on . . .  Needless to say, this bra isn’t my favorite, especially given my current life circumstances (I.e., being a mom who is breastfeeding . . .).  I would recommend the non-convertible version of this bra with scalloped edges. It’s a 9/10 bra (minus one because the coverage makes it difficult to wear any of the shirts that I usually use for nursing in public).",

You shouldn't even be able to remove the strap from back. I also own in every size (small, medium and large) and no matter what, they all snap. Also, the pads inside the bra constantly need adjusting. Almost more of a hassle than it should be.",
