Lauren Thompson,"Wanted to like it, but odd neckline ruins it for me",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VGW7Y0HYH5JE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBVH3LY2,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Silver,Verified Purchase,"I bought this originally for NYE. The pattern is pretty with velvet on the outside , but the interior mesh is a pretty scratchy/rough material. Completely sheer aside from the velvet. The neckline is also just odd, it doesn’t sit like a normal mock-neck does, but it kind of flops and folds over not in a very flattering way. It also doesn’t have a lot of stretch to it so getting it on and off isn’t a quick feat. Wanted to like it but will be returning",
Jasper,Beautiful Miduo Womens Velvet Burnout Top - But Sizing Runs Small!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRNKHUMC0T01N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBVH3LY2,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Brown,,"I'm delighted to share my review of the miduo Womens Slim Fit Velvet Burnout Top. I ordered this top for my wife, and she absolutely adores it! However, we did encounter some sizing issues.  My wife's usual size is Small (S), but I ordered a Medium (M) to ensure a comfortable fit. Unfortunately, the Medium still felt like a snug fit rather than a comfortable one. So, if you're looking for a relaxed fit, I'd definitely recommend sizing up.  The top itself is stunning! The velvety material is beautiful, and the burnout design adds a lovely touch of elegance. However, please note that it's quite sheer, so you'll definitely need to wear a tank top or camisole underneath.  The price of this top is reasonable, especially considering the quality of the material and the overall design.  One minor complaint is that the fitting at the neck is a bit off. It's not a deal-breaker, but it's something to be aware of.  Key Features:  - miduo Womens Slim Fit Velvet Burnout Top - Cowl neck long sleeve design - See-through sheer material - Velvety soft and elegant - Reasonable price  Pros:  - Beautiful velvety material - Elegant burnout design - Reasonable price - Lovely cowl neck long sleeve design  Cons:  - Sizing runs small, so size up for a comfortable fit - Fitting at the neck is a bit off - Quite sheer, so wear a tank top or camisole underneath  Overall, I'd recommend this top to anyone looking for a beautiful, velvety burnout top. Just be sure to size up for a comfortable fit!",

We got her a medium which is usually what she wears but unfortunately it’s a bit tight. I would definitely size up to get more of a comfortable fit. The material is velvet and really soft however it is on the thinner side. Depending on how tight and revealing it is on you may consider wearing a tank top underneath. Other than that the style is really nice and unique. The design helps take your outfit to the next level. It is really easy to dress it up or down. Overall this is a really nice shirt just remember to size up.,
Paula L.,Elegant Sheer Shirts with Gorgeous Sheen but Minor Flaws,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17RI4AYYNLW9O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBVH3LY2,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Light Blue,Verified Purchase,"These shirts are absolutely gorgeous! I purchased both the light blue and dark blue, which work well for different occasions. The fabric has a stunning sheen that I adore, and the material is thin and sheer, as advertised (I included a photo to show how see-through it is).  The fit, however, is a bit awkward. There’s no distinct front or back, and it seems designed for a flatter body type, which leaves little room for a fuller chest. This causes some fabric bunching above my chest, but the sheen and neckline almost make it look like an intentional ruffle detail.  The material is velvety, soft, and has a slight stretch, but I wouldn’t describe it as stretchy. Unfortunately, the velvet sheds, and by the end of the day, I noticed small fluff balls of fabric on my other clothes.  Despite these issues, I still love the shirts for their unique style and sheen. I think they’re reasonably priced for the quality, but I do wish the fabric wouldn’t shed. Overall, they’re pretty and versatile pieces I’ll continue to wear!",25

MDJ,"SO CLOSE, BUT SO FAR! Gorgeous color, but serious issues with sizing, etc.. Please read review!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UVNK2L6RMFDU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBVH3LY2,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 11, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Mauve,,"MAANNNNNN I wanted this top to work so much! The color is stunning and if you are able to figure out the sizing, would be a flattering form fit. Overall, I would NOT recommend for the reasons herein, but I gave a generous 3 stars because it MAY WORK FOR YOU and if it does, $20 is totally reasonable.  The main issue is with sizing (if you've read the other reviews, this isn't new news). I am normally a 2-4 so I ordered a small (34/36 b/c bust, 5'1"" petite and fit). Even being fit and preferring form-fitting tops, this was uncomfortably tight. If I were to order again, I would order up TWO sizes to a large because of the characteristics of the material.  Another issue is it is WAY too thin - so thin it feels like a cheap piece made for cheap labor in China :( Certain material on my skin really bothers me, and I could tell this was more polyester than the listing lead me to believe. Doesn't matter the cost, I can't wear clothing which feels overwhelming polyester. One reviewer stated a camisole is need under this, and if so, there's simply no room for it and you will burn up.  Even if I could get the right size and the material didn't bother me, I wouldn't be able to get over the collar. It's floppy with too little/too much loose material. Honestly, I felt like a Thanksgiving turkey! haha!  I gave this a generous 3 stars because if you are able to get the sizing correct and the neck/material doesn't bother you, $20 is an excellent price for a pretty piece. If you are someone who views clothing as investment, though, I do not recommend as this $20 will not get you a quality piece which will last.",

I wear M (6-8, 34dd, very long arms), and I like the fit. It is not cropped and not too long, looks good tucked in or out. The turtleneck is a bit too loose for my taste.
