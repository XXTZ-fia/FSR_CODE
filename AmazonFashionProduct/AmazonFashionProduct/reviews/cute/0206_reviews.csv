Since it is more affordable than those higher end brands, I think this might rip easily but so far I've had no issues. The padding is sufficient and I don't need to wear a bra with this, it even gives me a bit of a lift which is so nice. The sleeve length is long enough for my arms, I'm 5'7 almost 5'8 and always have an issue finding tops that don't cut off but this one is great!
