The leggings themself are comfortable. However, they ALL ripped the first wear. I am 170lbs 5’2” and wore them around the house just doing daily activities like chores and watching tv. Nothing strenuous. They fit a little loose honestly. I wasn’t unhappy except they ripped at the pockets a little each time I’d put my phone, or even just chapstick, into them. Not huge but tiny rips enough for me to worry if I was to wear these outside jogging I’d lose my key fob or phone. What really made me unhappy was the first wash. I put them in with the rest of my activewear. When I moved them into the dryer, everything had huge black blotches. The leggings were the ONLY new item. I had to toss several high end shirts because I could not get the stains out. I am so unhappy. Beware before you buy. :(",

If you are on the thin side they will not hug your legs.  I found them to be loose in the calf and thigh areas.  Although the product description states that they are moisture wicking, they definitely retain heat and will not keep you cool.  Recommended for casual wear and workouts in cool weather.

These were perfect in every way. I'm 5'6"" and 185 pounds and was going to get the xlarge but I ordered the 2x bc I didn't want them to tight and I'm glad I did. My body is not evenly propoetuined, I have a belly but no butt lol and fairly skinny legs. The 2x fit me perfectly. Went right up but needed a little tugging to get them as high in the waist as I wanted. They  hold me in nicely in all the right places but are definitely not too tight or restricting at all. They are so soft and comfortable I could live in them and most important not see thru. I feel like throwing out all my other pants as I'll be wearing these a lot and 3 pairs for $20 is definitely a bargain. I'll be ordering another package in different colors",11

I wouldn’t pay any more for this brand. The leggings are extremely soft and comfortable, and they have pockets that are large and the reason I got them…but they are thin and the “tummy control” it says it has is very laughable. It’s just a flimsy fabric that doesn’t even hold anything in. If I didn’t have shirts that covered my bum, I probably would have sent this back as they are so thin you can easily see any kind of underwear line through them. I haven’t noticed any issues with being see-through, but wouldn't be surprised if it happens after a while of natural wear and tear. I’m not dissatisfied with my purchase, but these definitely aren’t 4 or 5 star leggings. I think my soft leggings from Walmart are slightly better in terms of durability, except they don’t have pockets which makes these a better choice in my opinion. We’ll have to see how they hold up in the long run after washing a few times. I didn’t notice any smell when I took them out of the package, and they didn’t hold smell either when I was wearing them for the day. i would recommend but only if you aren't after high end leggings, jist something to lounge around in and maybe do running around or errands in.",11
