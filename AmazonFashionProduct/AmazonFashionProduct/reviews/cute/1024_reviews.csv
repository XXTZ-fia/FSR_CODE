I typically wear a medium in any top- I'm 5'7"" and 137 lbs. 34C.  I ordered this in a large based on reviews it fits perfectly.  It's extremely comfortable. The fabric is high quality, and buttery soft. I love the double layer of the fabric! It's not at all see through, and just more comfortable than most tanks. The square neck gives it a very sexy look on the decolatage area. Spelled that wrong I think. If you're busy at all, or wear a push up bra with it... wow! My husband loves it! The fabric has a significant amount of stretch and holds nice to the body. It doesn't look all wrinkly along the main body area, which I like. It IS shorter than the average, but it isn't a crop top. I would say it comes down (on me) right to where the top of a pair of regular jeans would land on the waist. I got the black one but will be ordering more colors now that I've worn it. As long as I receive the correct top in unused condition, I will be very happy. I recommend trying it! Order a size larger than usual for a good fit though.",

Now the lavender one. I only wore twice and I don’t use bleach on my laundry, not even whites. And I pulled it out of my drawer today to find this large stain. I wouldnt recommend buying these shirts. Everything is great but for some reason can only wear them a couple times before a mysterious stain appears. Maybe the coloring they use are too sensitive to soaps and discolors after a few washes?  Too expensive to repurchase since the two I have are brand new and already ruined.",3

Definitely needs nipple covers because you can see the shape under the top. But if you’ve put on a bra, the straps show. Maybe a strapless bra would work but I don’t like wearing those. Will have to get a tube top to wear underneath or go without. But it looks amazing and hugs my curves. Would love one in every color.",3
