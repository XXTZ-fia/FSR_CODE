The color was spot on blue and very beautiful. Fit nicely on my body but the sleeves were just a bit long so I was thinking of getting a smaller size instead but I got this when it was half off and don’t think paying an extra $20 for a smaller size is worth it. I am still going to return it though because it had weird stitching in the middle. It’s not wrinkles and you could obviously see it when I was wearing the shirt.  I think I probably just got a defective stitching one maybe because of the deal it was cheaper quality. Looks like wrinkles or maybe a water spot when wearing it.,

I am SO glad I took the chance on a great sale price because these came yesterday and I love them!! They arrived vacuum sealed in plastic bags, so they had deep wrinkles and creases. I pulled out a small clothes steamer and noticed they relaxed pretty easily. Then I threw one in the dryer with a wet towel, and by the time I checked again, the sweater was perfectly unwrinkled. The black color is nice, even dark black (the same as a pair of black dress slacks I was wearing when I opened the package). The apricot is true to color and lovely. The fit is loose and not cropped, and the sleeve is very cute. The horizontal ribbing all over steps it up from the usual solid color sweater. I just love these and will be watching to grab some brighter colors the next time i see them on special!",

The boat neck and lantern sleeves give it such a stylish and chic look, while still being super comfortable for everyday wear.  It’s versatile enough for any occasion, whether I’m at the office, running errands, or heading out for a casual dinner. I’ve gotten so many compliments on it already! It washes well (I used a laundry bag as recommended) and dries beautifully on a hanger without losing its shape.  If you’re looking for a sweater that’s warm, fashionable, and flattering, this is the one. Highly recommend!",6
