The inner liner on the bust needs to be a few inches longer, and hits the bust in a weird spot if you're a fuller cup size...every shirt seems to be designed for A-D cups, even shirts. Luckily you can't see the seem through the front so that is a plus. I also wish the shirt was 3 inches longer so its not a crop, but I usually wear a higher rise pant so it works.  I like a fitted long sleeve top and the material is smooth so its great with so many outfits. I also love the scoop neck. It's not too deep, and it's not too shallow. The color selection is really lovely too!",

I’ve pretty much bought them in every color at this point. They are a great basic to throw on with a pair of work out pants to run errands or to wear as a laying piece. They can also be dressed up with a pair of jeans or skirt. The material is soft and comfortable/breathable. It’s double layer so it’s supportive and you can wear with or without a bra- I have a larger chest and there’s not many shirts I’ll wear without a bra and still feel supported but this is one. It’s true to size. I am a size large in tops and bought the large- they are meant to be snug so if you want a looser fit size up. Also like that they are not crop!

This one is super cute, and the buttery soft material feels amazing. However, they added a half undershirt inside (definitely not a bra, because it’s not holding anything down). I’m a 36D, and while the top itself is comfy and stretchy, the undershirt doesn’t fit over my chest properly. I tried it with a bra, but it just made things more awkward. If you’re smaller-chested, this top would probably work great for you. For me, the little underlayer is too short to comfortably cover my chest, so it ends up feeling uncomfy. That said, the material and overall stretch are still fantastic! I’m returning them all :(",9
