It is a soft, lightweight shirt.  I like the neckline as well as the cuffed sleeves.  I ordered a large (I am 5’ 7”, 130ish pounds, 36D) after checking the size chart.  It is the right size for me (it fits comfortably).  The floral graphics are pretty (vinyl).  The shirt washes up nicely (I turn it inside out, wash it in cold water on colors cycle, pop it into the dryer for just a couple of minutes, and then I hang it up to dry).  The shirt comes out soft and with minimal wrinkles.  I like this floral t-shirt.",

They're clearly printed and the design is whimsical. The top is soft and well made with no stray stitching. The raspberry colour gives an outfit a nice bit of pop, too. It's a crop, but it goes down far enough so that you don't have to worry about over exposure if you reach for something high. Fun summer T!",
Lesli Neuenschwander,This shirt is adorable--runs large,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E7NQQIWCUE95/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8T7LGVQ,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 11, 2024",,,"I loved the neckline on this shirt, and the flower design on the front is such a nice touch!  I wasn't sure what size to get, because there wasn't an actual size chart on the listing. The description said refer to the size chart in the image, but there wasn't one, so I did end up with a shirt too large.  I usually wear a large, but these things run small so much I sized up, and it is too big--I knocked a star off for the lack of info.The shirt itself is great though--really soft and not see through. I don't know how long the flower decal on the front will last, I machine wash and toss in the dryer, so it would probably last longer if it was hung to dry, but I always forget to dig it out of the laundry load to do that.  The description again lacked the info. to let me know if it needs to be hung dry, but so far so good though, and it washes well.",
Sara T.,I adore this shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28JGVHABN0PKW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8T7LGVQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 11, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Purple4,,"This shirt is fabulous!

I do wish that it had less of a vinyl transfer feel and seemed more like a silk screen. I get the impression that over time the design will either peel off or break down, but it is cute while it lasts. It is also super soft which is a bonus. I do think it might run slightly small - I would have liked it to be more flowy and it was more boxy on me, but overall really nice.",

I would recommend washing it inside out, and probably not putting it in the dryer unless you are setting the temperature to its lowest setting. The fabric is super soft but not very breathable so it might not be the best on a really hot day. I'm usually a medium, and I ordered a med in this shirt. It fits perfectly. I'm 5'5, 140lbs for reference.",

I buy a lot of graphic shirts and this one looked more like an iron on screen print.  It also ran a bit bigger than other XL and just didn't fit me right. It wasn't horrible but wouldn't be a go-to every day shirt like my others are.,
TR3,great color,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37O7MAEMPT2S4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8T7LGVQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 17, 2024",,,"Got this in recently and feel in love with it.  It is soft, not scratchy at all. My sister even complimented me on the color of the blue, which is lovely.  I enjoy feeling comfortable during the day but I don't want to feel frumpy. This is a good balance of comfotable but nice looking. I can go outside and water the garden and not worry about maybe getting it dirty, but I can also wear it out of the house and feel put together and that I actually tried.  Great buy!",
