I’m curvy with a nice size rear and I thought these would accentuate it, but they definitely don’t. I do disagree with the reviews saying they are thin though. I bought the black and gray set and both are pretty thick. So much so, that they don’t look like tights considering the pattern. Maybe it’s a color choice thing, because I ordered tops from this same company to match and the same colors look way different when ordering the shirts. I honestly wouldn’t purchase anything from this seller again because none of their clothing seems to be consistent.",
