I wear between a 38 and 42 DD bra. I am 5’7 and 160lbs, it is a good length as well, it comes down just to the top of my pants. Being a little thicker in the belly area. I was afraid it would show too much belly for me but it’s perfect and the lace is not too see through but just enough to be sexy! The material is soft and not scratchy like some lace. It is a little thin so I can see how it would be easy to tear. Over all it was a great buy and I can’t wait to wear it!!",

It was only tolerable for her for about 2 minutes before she had to take it off as it was that uncomfortable. I guess you get what you pay for lol.  I give it two stars, one for fit and one for the quick shipping to get it to me in time for the event she wanted to wear it to. In the end it was returned due to the uncomfortable nature of the fabric. I cannot recommend this product.",

I do think this top is sheer and stretchy enough that someone in between sizes, like myself, can opt for the smaller of the sizes and have it look great, feel comfy and well-fitted, and be confident the correct size was chosen.  The black reminds me of some classic old school apparel with a mix of old school. I have size 36 full Ds, and it doesn’t look trashy. With that being said, I think this top accommodates women of all shapes & sizes especially when it comes to the size of the bust  Highly highly recommended",
