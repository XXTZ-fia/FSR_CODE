Jonathan Rodriguez,They are just OK,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VLJVLMB57K9S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5MTZNSR,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I don't dislike these enough to return them but also wouldn't purchase them again. The fabric is thinner than I expected for $32 leggings (especially when comparable products on Amazon were around $20). I live in Southern California, so not a cold climate, but my legs were freezing in 65-degree weather. These also just feel like very high-waisted leggings as opposed to maternity leggings, which is fine I guess. The belly part of the leggings are no different than the rest of the leggings.",

Ido like the soft stretchy workout material of them. These are mid and I wouldn't buy them again, keeping because I'm only pregnant for a short while and they do the job enough, just not a huge fan of wearing them.",

I have cotton leggings that I can’t wear due to my increase of swelling in my legs, so these have been my number 1 go too as they don’t suffocate my ankles.  Highly suggest them.

These are FANTASTIC! So comfortable for an everyday/lounge legging while pregnant - I haven't worked out with them but they are not compressive at all so probably only good for walking. They are light and buttery soft and fit well - I'd say if anything they run a little big but not to the point that you need to size down. Going to grab another pair or two!,

Very similar in feel to the align leggings from lululemon.  Fits really well other the bump.  I'm about 32 weeks pregnant, 5'6"" hovering around 170 lbs and the medium fits great.  Pre-pregnancy weight was around 140-145 and my usual size was medium.  I believe there is still plenty of room in these to continue to stretch through the end of the pregnancy.  Other leggings I've tried are too constricting at the top of the belly and at the ankles and are not stretchy enough and cut in causing discomfort.  These leggings do not have that problem.  They are comfortable to wear all day long, and there are no seams that cut into the legs.  I wish I would have bought these earlier in the pregnancy and before I purchased two other pairs from other maternity-specific brands.  Only note is they are not very warm if you are looking for something to wear out in the winter.  However, they are amazing and breathable when you get to someone who keeps their house at 74 degrees...  Highly recommend -- will likely by another pair.",

For maternity leggings, I expected them to be cozy and gentle on my skin, especially during pregnancy when comfort is key—this was just not the case.  The fit itself wasn’t terrible, but the material was far from soft or luxurious. I kept thinking maybe I just got a defective pair, but after checking, it seems like this is the quality across the board.  For the price, these leggings were a letdown. I ended up returning them because there’s no way I’d want to spend all day in these uncomfortable, not-so-soft leggings.  1/5 stars, do not recommend. If you’re looking for buttery-soft leggings, keep looking! These are not it.",
