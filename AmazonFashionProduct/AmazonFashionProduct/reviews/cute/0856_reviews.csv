However it is my favorite material as it is light, stretchy and thin and feels like you're wearing nothing. I am not stacked up top but my ladies are looking fantastic in this top, it somehow gives support and the perfect tightness factor without feeling constricting in any way. My only downside is that I don't have a bra that you don't see with this top, But that feels like a personal problem as I just need to get a better racer back. I create outfits around this top because I want to wear it all the time. I'm going to have to buy it in all the colors",17

The material is good quality and feels like a cotton blend, but is actually 95% viscose and 5% spandex.  It has a little bit of stretch but not very much. Weirdly, a different brand name tag was on it when I received it.So, why so few stars?Unfortunately, the sizing chart is way off, so even though I went by the chart this is much too small for me.  I'm 5'4"" 170 lbs and have a 38D bust and a 36"" waist.  I got this top in the size X-Large and it is at least 2 sizes too small for me. It's a shame because otherwise I do like this top.",10
