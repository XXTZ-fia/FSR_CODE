They are cropped but not excessively cropped  They could be nice for layering especially because of how thin they are they won't add much bulk, but the fabric feels cheap for how expensive they are. You can get tank tops that aren't sheer and aren't cropped at this very moment at walmart for less than $3 apiece. These are about $6 apiece for less fabric. Now I know there are some nicer camisoles out there for like $20 apiece but come on.  They definitely feel like they wouldn't hold up well in the washer or dryer.
