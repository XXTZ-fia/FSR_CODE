It is super soft and the quality is better than I imagined. I ordered a small and it was the perfect fit. It wasn’t too tight and I still had a little bit of room. Living in Florida, I don’t have a need for sweaters that often, but I will definitely buy another one of these in a different color. It is a little bit off the shoulder, so you could even wear it over a mock turtleneck or a tank top. Definitely one of my best purchases so far in 2025.",

This is tiny, it’s definitely not oversized, the sleeves are really short and just barely hit the top of my wrist, and it definitely doesn’t have that slouchy, off the shoulder look shown here. You’d need to size up probably 2 sizes to get the look it’s showing here, BUT beware that with a bigger size, the neck might not be “off the shoulder”, it might just be too large and low, and the sweater might not be slouchy oversized, it might just be fitted but longer. Also, the color is okay, it’s hard to see in pics but it’s not a pretty brown, so I’d try a different color. It’s not super soft, definitely needs a shirt underneath because the stitching is pretty loose, but it’s not scratchy. If you really want this sweater, size up and see how you like it, but I’ve purchased others for cheaper that generally just fit better all around, so this is a return for me.",5

The ribbed knitted fabric provides just the right amount of stretch, making it cozy without feeling restrictive. It’s perfect for those cooler fall days when you want to stay warm but still look stylish. The length of the sweater is ideal, hitting at just the right spot to be flattering without being too short.

I almost went to a medium and I’m here to say I’m glad I stayed with my normal size-it’s still very baggy for a small if that’s what you are looking for. I was VERY happy with coffee and white colors- both were perfection. Apricot model photos show a cool toned fiber that looks speckled and in person I felt it was more like an unspeckled beige. It just looked cheap to me. They should redo those photos it’s misleading. In person it’s more like a flat one color light warm toned beige. But! I found that the white color IS actually what I was looking for when I purchased apricot….so if you like the apricot photos try the white product instead lol! I can wear a pink, green, blue, or taupe leggings and the white looks good with all so it’s very versatile. I don’t feel like I have to constantly adjust the neckline to keep it off the shoulder, even with arm movements it seems to stay put off the shoulder and I like that. The bottom of the sweater has a little “rolled up” accent which is cute. Overall it has a lot of give and stretch so you can play with how you want it to look.",173
