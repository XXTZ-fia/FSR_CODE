I read the reviews and purchased a small but I could have got a medium. I'm almost 5'4 and 135 lbs with an athletic build. The shirt is tight and not cropped it does cover your stomach. It's a thick, soft kinda shiny material and stretchy. I definitely would recommend and right now it's a great price!",2

The material is super buttery and soft, with minimal elasticity. The fit is my only reason for 4 stars. I ordered a Size Small and the shoulder with the strap didn’t quite fit underneath my arm, so the material pokes out slightly. Also, it shrinks slightly in the wash. For some, it may run slightly small, so I recommend upsizing. Overall, I still love this top and have worn it many times! Just keep in mind of the sizing.",2

I took the advice of the other reviewers and sized down to a Small (I'm usually a Medium). It fits perfectly - the bottom hits me just below my belly button (I'm 5'10). If you're in-between sizes, or are worried about having enough support for your chest, I'd recommend sizing down. I'm going to buy more in all the colors!",10

NO BRA NEEDED! however I am apart of the itty bitty club. It fit snug which is what I wanted and I paired it with a skirt for church. I appreciated the fact that it’s not a belly shirt but could be if I decide to scrunch it up a bit more. It’s a nice buttery fabric and the built in shelf bra was comfy and didn’t move. I initially wore it with shapewear under for church and it was very stretchy and not see through. It’s a true black and I accidentally dried it after washing but it didn’t fade in color!
