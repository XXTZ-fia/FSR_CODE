I figured they messed up the order and maybe sent one “striped grey blue” pair on accident. I decided I’d keep that pair for myself and reorder a 6th pair to make sure I have matching colors for bridesmaid. Unfortunately the color came wrong AGAIN. So now I’m not even sure if it’s a mistake and I think it’s just one of those cheap brands that isn’t consistent in their fabric colors. I’ve tried reaching out to the company directly. But if you’re looking to buy more than 1 I would not recommend as you will not get the same color. Unfortunately I’m now out $180 trying to get the same color pajamas….  ALSO, in my picture, I got 4 of the pajamas on the left (more aqua blue color) and 2 of the ones on the right (more of a sky/dusty blue). Again these were all supposed to be the “striped blue” pajamas. The one of the left that looks aqua blue doesn’t even remotely match any of the product/model pictures. So again, while I love the fit and look of these, I’m doubtful I’ll even be able to get the right color sent to me :(",3
