It is a loose fit but not necessarily as baggy as some oversized shirts. The length is there, though. I love the half-sleeves/elbow-length sleeves. The quality seems pretty good. The black and gray combo is my favorite raglan combo. Overall, I have been happy with this shirt. I have been letting it air-dry, after washing, to help keep it in good shape.",
