This is Not a thick sweatshirt. It is made thin. You will have to put a thermal shirt on underneath to keep warm.  They do not make sweatshirts thick anymore. I bought them thinking they would be warm but they are not. I do a lot of flying between Texas and Germany they do not keep you warm on the plane.Germany is always so much colder than Texas so I have to try and find a happy medium as far as warmth. Luckily I packed a thermal shirt in my carry on. Plus I packed a sweater.  If you are looking for something warm this is Not it unless you layer it.  Otherwise, I love it. Just an FYI the brown pants and brown top do not match even though they both say brown. The pants are more of a coffee color so I would order the coffee top sweat shirt. I still love them. I believe I could go down a size I ordered an XL.  I believe I should have ordered a large. The top is so large it’s not up against your arms to keep you warm and it’s hard to get a sweater or jacket over the sweat shirt  because it’s so big.  My size is normally a 14-16. I am thinking of ordering a large next time. I own three XL. As long as you have a thermal shirt underneath you shouldn’t need a sweater but I stay cold. I was really hoping these would be thick.",3

Just buy this sweatshirt!  I got it on PrimeDay for $26, but even at its regular price, it is well worth it!  The quality is top notch. Super cozy.  I spent a long time reading reviews to figure out what size to order, and I nailed it!  So, to save you all some time:  This is an “oversized sweatshirt” just as it says in the title.  I like my sweatshirts slightly roomy but not oversized down to my knees like the teeny-boppers are wearing these days.  I am 5’6” and weigh 130. I have a 34C chest and normally wear  size  4 or 6 pants and  small-medium shirts.  I would order a medium in a normal sweatshirt.  So for this sweatshirt, I ordered a small and it was still roomy and oversized. It is perfect.  Now, if you want the REALLY over-sized look that so many teenagers are wearing (you know, with shorts you can’t even see), then order your regular size :)",21
