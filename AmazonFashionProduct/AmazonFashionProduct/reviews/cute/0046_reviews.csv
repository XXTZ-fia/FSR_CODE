Blossom,Gorgeous color but shrank a bit and not super warm,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KV55XXZA41KI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYQ65H4J,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Size: LargeColor: White,,"I bought this in Spanish Moss which is an unbelievably beautiful color. I initially ordered a Large as the chart indicated I should get an XL but I wanted a more fitted look for this particular hoodie. The Large was definitely too big so I ordered a Medium which fit perfectly. Unfortunately, as soon as I washed it (gentle, cold water) and dried it (low heat until damp then air dry), it shrank. I can still zip it but it is now FITTED, so if whatever color you order is a 50/50 blend of cotton and poly, unless you want it to fit like it’s glued to you, go for one that is a bit larger than how you actually want it to fit. I do find it to be quite the thin sweatshirt. It will be good to take to the beach or bring to cookouts or on hikes, where even in summer the evenings can be a bit damp and chilly. It is not the kind of sweatshirt you put on and immediately feel like you’re under a blanket, so while it’s good for layering and I’ll wear it in the shoulder seasons, I find the Amazon Basics sweatshirts are thicker and warmer. Living in the Northeastern US, our weather goes from one extreme to another so layers are important and this will definitely get used. In terms of style, I don’t love the dropped shoulder but I’m so in love with the color, I’ll ignore it. It is a bit shorter than my other hoodies. I have a long torso so I’ll have to be mindful of that; those with regular or short torsos may really like that it’s shorter and therefore a bit more stylish and less slouchy than most hoodies. It feels like it’s decently made, although I’m not convinced it’ll last years and years the way some of my other hoodies have. I will continue to wash it on gentle and try to space out laundering to avoid any pilling or wear.",

Apparently, the seams aren't stitched with the normal type of thread etc... I'm not sure what holds the seams in place but it obviously didn't hold up for me wearing it a few times.. Not sure if it came with the hole in the arm seam since I didn't inspect it closely since it was new-direct from manufactuer I'm assuming.

I obviously didn't read the description carefully! This one is a bit heavier than my original one, but it's a nice weight for the cooler days we have in FL.  It's very soft and cozy on the inside and very comfortable to wear. It's stretchy enough to push up the sleeves, but not overly stretchy. I followed the size chart and got the large, however, it's quite big on me. I was going to return for the medium, but since I got it for relaxing at home I've decided to keep it. It definitely serves It's purpose! Laundering is simple and since the fabric is 50/50 cotton & polyester there's no shrinking to worry about. Overall, I think it's a great hoodie to have on hand and with the price point, it's a terrific value! If this was the lighter weight style, I'd definitely buy more colors!",6
