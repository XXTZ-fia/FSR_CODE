I love that look and it’s great for disguising a belly.It’s so hard to find good tops that fit my body type.  I’m a 36C with a 34” waist, basically a tree stump, but I wear a petite small or medium in baggy swing tops.  Ive lost some weight so I recently decided to try some form fitting tops but definitely didn’t want anything cropped.  I’ve lost the weight everywhere but my belly and a crop hits the belly and rolls up.I’m 73 but I hope I haven’t lost my style.  It just requires a little ingenuity and a lot of trial and error. 😂",

I am an xs in A&F for reference, and pretty much all other brands. 5'4, 115 lbs, 32B chest. The xs was too large at the neck line, both in the front and in the back. It'd probably work on someone with a larger chest than mine. It did not lay flat the way I wanted it to. I will say though, the arm holes were perfect size and did not expose my bra at all. I wanted so badly to like this, because I LOVE the slash top neckline, but it is sold out on A&F. The material was decent for an Amazon shirt, it was soft with some give/stretch to it. It was slightly see-through, but I was also wearing a black bra with a white top. It would probably be fine with a white or nude bra. So sad this didn't work out!

A classier cut tank top, easy to wear as business casual or dressed up on a day off, even tucked into jeans it elevates the outfit from casual to classy without making it look like you're trying too hard. They're form fitting without exposing any unflattering bits since the fabric is thick it sort of smoothes some of it over. I got it as a postpartum top to layer with jackets and sweaters, and believe it or not it functions pretty well for a nursing mom. It's not too tight in the bust since the cowl takes some of the pressure off but keeps my bust from moving too much. It also provides good overage when ticked into pants without adding bulk around the waistline. Also not remotely transparent in the colors I got. So definitely worthwhile!",

Authorized Review,Sleek and Stylish: Great Tank Top with Length Considerations! 4 Stars - Could Have Been 5...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15X53P54PZCF7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CXJPNCX5,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 1, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Red,Verified Purchase,"Fit and Sizing: I'm 5'9"" and weigh 135 lbs; I ordered this tank top in size small. The fit is form-fitting without being too tight, but it’s longer than I expected, hitting slightly below the waist. If you’re shorter, it might be longer than you want it to be.  Color and Appearance: I chose the red color, which is vibrant and true to the product images. The color was exactly as expected and adds a bold pop to any outfit.  Quality and Material: The material is lightweight but not sheer at all, making it perfect for those who want a thinner shirt without worrying about it being see-through. The style is also great if you're concerned about sweat stains, as the armholes are slightly lower than a typical shirt, providing more airflow and reducing the chance of visible sweat stains.  Style: This tank top has a sleek and modern design, with a slightly asymmetrical neckline that adds a touch of uniqueness. It’s perfect for pairing with high-waisted jeans, skirts, or shorts for a stylish Y2K-inspired look.  Comfort: The top is very comfortable to wear, with its soft, stretchy material and sleeveless design that keeps you cool.  Durability: After a few washes, the color has stayed vibrant, and the fabric has held its shape well with no signs of pilling or fading.  Value for Money: Given the stylish design and quality of the material, this tank top offers great value for the price. I would definitely consider ordering it in other colors.  Specific Use Cases: Perfect for casual outings, going out with friends, or even layering under a jacket or blazer for a more polished look. It’s versatile and easy to style for various occasions.  Cons: The shirt is longer than I wanted, especially at my height of 5’9”. For those who are shorter, it might be longer than desired.  Return and Customer Service Experience: I was going to return it because it was longer than anticipated for the outfit I had planned- but it's still a great shirt for other occasions so I didn’t end up returning it. The shipping was fast, and the product arrived as described.",36
