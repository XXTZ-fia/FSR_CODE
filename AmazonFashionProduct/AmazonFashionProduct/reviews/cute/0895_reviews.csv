My son just turned 16m and is fitting the 24m pj's with some room to grow. He runs hot at night (we keep our house at 68-69 degrees) and these allow for him to not overheat because his body heat doesn't stay trapped like with fleece pj's. But they are also warm, and as a little guy who likes to kick his blankets off, his feet will not get cold because of the footed pajamas. These pajamas are stretchy, soft, not see through, have padded footsies, and work for play too. I haven't had any issues with the feet or other areas getting holes, and he's a very active toddler. There is only one zipper from the neck area not from the bottom which works for us because his legs have always been to long to change with the double zipper pjs. They are not fold over hand cuff pajamas. The patterns are adorable, it's 100 percent cotton, it seems they have some new patterns with the seasons, the prices are good on sale or if u just need 1 at a time, just try them out. My only problem is they stop at 24 months 💔. It would be amazing if these went up to 5 y.o.",

They’re always so soft and high quality. They’re also usually pretty expensive too and are $15 a pair. The boy PJs went on sale during cyber week and I got this pair for $7 and I bought others that I thought could be worn by both girls and boys as well. I love this particular pattern, they’re soft, like Burt’s bees clothes usually are, and the feet have the rubber padding on the bottom for slip resistance. The material is decently thick and has provided lots of warmth during these colder winter nights. The PJs have also stayed the same print quality throughout a dozen washes so far and still look as though we just bought them. The size was spot on and fit her snugly and perfectly but yet also had some extra foot room. The material also stretches nicely. Overall I highly recommend, even at the $15 price. These are great quality pjs and I look forward to more patterns!",
