The material is super soft, breathable, and has just the right amount of stretch. I’m usually a small, and the sizing was spot on—fits perfectly without feeling too tight or restrictive.  Compared to my Lululemon top, this one is slightly less compressive, which makes it more comfortable for all-day wear. While Lululemon offers more support for intense workouts, it also squeezes my lats a bit too much, causing some unflattering bulging. This top, however, provides great coverage and support without that issue. The U-back design is both stylish and functional, keeping everything in place while still looking flattering.  Overall, this is an amazing dupe at a fraction of the price! Perfect for workouts, lounging, or even dressing up with jeans. I love it so much that I’m already planning to buy more colors! Highly recommend!",8
