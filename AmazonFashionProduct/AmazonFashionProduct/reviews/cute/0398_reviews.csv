Much better quality than I was expecting for the price. I love this blue color too. I will definitely get more colors. You do need a good brat of pair with it because of how low-cut it is and how wide the straps are. It's definitely a casual top. Wouldn't use it for working out or anything. It's really comfortable and you don't feel exposed or anything. Just beware it is a true crop tank so your tummy will be exposed if you don't have a super high-waisted bottom.,

It ruins the overall aesthetic of any outfit. Being able to rock this shirt without a bra is such a WIN, but I love that it has a high back because then I can still wear a bra if I really think I need it. The fabric is super thick and stretchy and has such a good hold to it. It makes the shape of my chest look great, can't recommend enough.",
