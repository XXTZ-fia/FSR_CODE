Once the temperatures start dropping but before winter really sets in, this is my daily companion. It hits that sweet spot of being cozy and warm without overheating you - perfect for those above-freezing fall and early winter days.  What I really appreciate about this fleece is the attention to practical details. The zipper runs smoothly without snagging (which is surprisingly rare in fleece jackets), and the pockets are actually functional - not just decorative afterthoughts. They're deep enough to be useful for keys, phone, or keeping your hands warm.  The only minor quirk worth mentioning is that it does tend to attract pet hair, but it's not a dealbreaker at all since it brushes off easily. The fleece material has held up well through regular wear and washing, maintaining both its shape and coziness.  For reference, I wear this as my primary jacket during fall and milder winter days, only switching to a heavier coat when temperatures really plummet. It's so reliable that I already know I'll replace it with the exact same model once this one eventually wears out (though that seems a long way off given how well it's holding up).  If you're looking for that perfect mid-weight jacket that bridges the gap between light sweaters and heavy winter coats, this Columbia fleece absolutely fits the bill.",4
