Carsonrn,Great casual shirt.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZPJZ1TH3O8W5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C2Z1M6LK,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 3, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Army Green,Verified Purchase,"It’s thin and has incredible drape. Before I put it on the material feels cool, almost wet, but it’s pure comfort once it’s on. The hems are rolled which looks chic and military or utilitarian with the olive drab color I picked. It’s very thin and shows my bra and skin texture but the material is fully opaque in this color. It has some light stretch but the fabric has body, it’s not just cheap spandex. The shoulders and sleeves are fitted and well articulated. The material stretched to accommodate my bust without being baggy at the waist. I look forward to trying other colors.",3

I buy these when I need a top to layer under something, like a strappy dress, or when I need a top in a specific color for a one-off outfit. As an example, I wanted a forest green tee to wear under an Anthropologie pinafore. The color isn’t very common, and most of the top is covered by the dress, so this worked. I would not get these as a staple.  If you want a bodycon, Y2K fit then order your normal clothing size. If you want a relaxed fit, I would size up.",
