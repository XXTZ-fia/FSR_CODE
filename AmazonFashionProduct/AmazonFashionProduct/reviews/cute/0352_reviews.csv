The front ones on the hip are NOT as deep as the accent stitching makes it seem (which kinda defeats the purpose of girls cargo pants: to finally get functional pockets you can put things in, like a cell phone in). I marked the bottom of the pocket in yellow in one of the photos. Also the pockets on the side of the legs only have decorative buttons. There's no way to clip or snap the pocket closed.  Bottom line: they're great if you want the look of cargo pants, but be prepared for faux-function. We're returning these.",5
