I like that they have some tummy control and they're buttery smooth but they attract so much animal fur and lint too easily! But that's black for ya 🤷🏼‍♀️. I got these on sale for Black Friday after having them saved for a few months. I didn't think I'd like them so I only ordered the one pair but I think I'll get the grey and purple pair too! And those will be less likely to show fur and lint. I'll edit this once I wear them again and add a pic of the length of them on my long legs. Also, I washed and dried them expecting the pockets to flare up which is super annoying and they didn't! I was so surprised. I definitely recommend but there is one annoyance. The back of the knees.. the material bunches up a bit. Why?! 🤷🏼‍♀️ It's annoying but I've only worn them once so we'll see..",7
