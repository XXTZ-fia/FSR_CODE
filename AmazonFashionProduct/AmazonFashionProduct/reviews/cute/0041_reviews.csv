The photo looked darker than the actual sweater, but it was still lovely. The weight of the sweater kept me very warm on a very cold day without making me feel as if I was sweltering. I wore it for a holiday with black slacks, and received so many compliments that I was almost embarrassed to say that it was a regift to myself. This time a a sweater that will look great with jeans or dressed up with a nice skirt or slacks. My only complaint was that it snagged on a few things, but that’s more my clumsiness.

It is oversized but not too much so with the brown trimmed one I got a large and decided to wash in warm and dry in dryer and it did shrink up enough that I like it.  The forest green I got a medium and do like the fit a little better.  I like oversized for most sweaters but for this one I wanted it a bit more fitted. Either way I love them both.  It washed well and my friend couldn’t believe it was off of Amazon.  The weave is a smidge loose so I layer with a tshirt.  I wore the green one with green Steve Madden sneakers and it was super cute and sporty.,4
