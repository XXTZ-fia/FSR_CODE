I'm not sure if having it tucked in made the difference. It almost has a compression like feel to it. I forgot to mention in my first review but the cutout isn't especially revealing so it's still work appropriate, at least for less corporate offices perhaps.

I ordered one size up and it still fits just as tightly as on the model. I love the modern Asymmetrical design and nice sharp cut shoulders. It is decent quality, well-made. But it is so clingy. It really does show every single line of your bra. If you watch the video of the model, you can see how it’s clinging up underneath her bra and you can literally see the underwire. I just think that’s kind of tacky looking. So I’m frustrated that after sizing up it’s still that tight. Luckily the fabric isn’t super super thin, but it is very stretchy and slim cut so that makes it clingy.  I think in black, it might be OK. The sleeves are very long. I would say this is a slightly muted blue based forest green, kind of like an Eagles green.  It’s fairly close to the photos, just maybe a tiny bit brighter in person",
