It’s a little on the dressier side, but can be worn casually as well. I’m usually a large, and the large fits great. (42” bust, 38” waist, 42” hips, size 12, 36DD). The material is opaque and what I would consider more formal than tee shirt / woven fabric. It’s kind of like the fabric version of crepe paper if that makes sense. You can wear it by itself or under a blazer. Color is as shown. I liked it so much I bought it in 3 colors. The one shown here has creases as it’s just out of the bag, but they do come out in the wash.",
