But I am certain I could have ordered an xtra small and still had plenty of room. Since this is just to walk the dog on cool mornings, or to lounge around in the house, and maybe a quick run to the grocery or the coffee shop, I did not bother to return it for an xtra-small.  The Good: It's a pretty color (I bought the mauve-rose). It is warm and cozy and fufills the purpose that I bought it for.  If you are shorter than 5'4"", you should consider going 2 sizes smaller than normal. It will still be oversized.",
