They fit well and were comfortable but definitely on the short side. Like booty cheeks nearly out. Then after 1 or 2 washes I’ve noticed that the fabric is fraying on the ends (and I air dried them). I know they’re probably going to look worse after a few more washes. I wouldn’t recommend these to a friend or buy them again myself but I’m giving them 3 stars for being comfy and cute.,4
