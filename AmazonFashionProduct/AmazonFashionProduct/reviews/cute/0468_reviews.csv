It is quality clothing at a reasonable price. This two-piece set is no exception. I'm 5-4, 140 lbs, with a curvy figure. The size small fit perfectly, although the waistband was a bit tight when pulling it on over my hips. However, once it was on, the waistband was comfortable. The sleeve length is a bit long, with the sleeve hitting above just where my thumb meets my palm, but I like that, especially when it's cold out. The inseam length is perfect -- no need to hem the pants. The pants also feature side pockets, and the top has a half zip that you can unzip all the way and show off a tanktop underneath, or zip all the way up for added warmth. I got it in Navy, but have now ordered a Medium in Black, just to compare. Perfect for running errands or a remote work day.",

I can’t say how it will hold up over time, but it seems high quality. The material feels very soft and comfortable.

It seems to be made a little oversized in a good, modern way. The pants are fitted at the waist and hips but flare out at the bottom. The top sits just below the waist line, short enough to have that modern feel but not so short that your stomach is exposed when you raise your arms.
