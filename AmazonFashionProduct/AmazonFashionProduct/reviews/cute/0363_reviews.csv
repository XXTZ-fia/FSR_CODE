I would like them in a 3x as well but they stretch and fit well enough that I have no intention of returning these lol And perfect timing for all these cold snaps we're getting in the south.

But this last order was just not up to the usual standards. I sized up because I wanted some ease in case they shrunk in the wash. The green camo fit perfectly. The other two pairs in this pack definitely are not the same size. The black/gray ones are like putting on compression tights. They are still soft to touch but so darn tight and not nearly as much stretch as the green ones. I haven’t dared try the other black ones because they feel just like the black/gray ones, very similar to compression tights. And the legs are super long! So if you have long willowy legs and a big tummy and bum then these would probably fit you. If you have short heavy legs you might want to pass.",

Got them and tried them on there was absolutely no way. Gave them to my 14 year old who's usually a medium and they didn't fit her either. My youngest tried them on being silly and they actually fit her. She's 10 and she runs in a women's small. They were still big on her but they fit her nearly perfect. Although the size was incredibly off. She loves them. Super soft. They still appear to be thin though and they do not have pockets. I wouldn't suggest these.,

I have *always* struggled to find yoga pants that fit properly. I’m a size 20-22 and 5'11"", so most yoga pants either don’t stay in place during my workouts, are too loose, or are too low-waisted and constantly roll down. But THESE? Perfect. When I say perfect, I mean *perfect*. If you're tall, definitely get the longer length option—they’ll hit your ankles just right. The high-waisted design covers your hips and waist beautifully, and best of all, they *don’t move*! Even with rolls, they stay in place and move with you like a second skin, but without being tight or uncomfortable. They’re buttery soft—no itch, no irritation—just pure comfort.  They’re true to size, so be sure to order your correct size. If you buy them too loose, you won’t get that skin-like movement and smoothing effect that makes these so amazing. When you first unpack them, they may seem small, but trust me, they stretch and fit *perfectly*, like putting on nylons, but without any of the discomfort. I initially bought a 3-pack and loved them so much that I immediately purchased 2 more. I wear them every day—they’re an absolute dream!",2
