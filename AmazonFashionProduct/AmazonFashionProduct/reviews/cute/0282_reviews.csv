She’s tall and thin for her age and the 2T pants were the perfect length. Too fit perfectly as well but I was not impressed with the fabric. It will wrinkle into a knot when washed and  it has no give or stretch which for a toddler is very important. For that reason I am returning this outfit. I also ordered it in the pink muslin and we love it! I am keeping that one as the fabric is much more conducive for a toddler. Hope this helps someone!,
