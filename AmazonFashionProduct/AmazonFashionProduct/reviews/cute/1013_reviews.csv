Korenski,"Soft and Comfy, But Not as Stylish as Expected",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AH0PZAYW7B48/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CVVQV6FV,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 4, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Khaki,Verified Purchase,"The AUTOMET Women's T-Shirt is definitely soft and comfortable, but it didn’t quite live up to the stylish look in the photos. The fit isn’t very tailored, so the design doesn’t have that crisp, cool vibe I was hoping for. I also got the tan color, which didn’t flatter me as a blonde with blue eyes—it just felt a bit dull. While it’s cozy for casual wear, it’s not as cute or polished as I expected. The quality is pretty decent though so maybe a different color would work.",
