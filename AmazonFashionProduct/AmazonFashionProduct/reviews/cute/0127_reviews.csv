It doesn’t fall in a natural spot along my waist, too low to sit at my waist, but higher than low rise jeans. Just awkward. I have to pull them up, which makes them super short or push them down, which makes them fit weird.  I ordered an XL, and I’m generally a L to XL in all of my shorts with room because I don’t like them super tight. The waist on these is a little tight, just enough to be annoying, but not enough that the next size up would fit. They also don’t have a functional pocket.  I’ll keep these for the gym, but definitely wouldn’t buy another pair.",
