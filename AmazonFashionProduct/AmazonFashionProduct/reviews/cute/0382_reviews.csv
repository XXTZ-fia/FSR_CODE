The cat is super cute on the shirt, and I love the bright blue color with the white polka-dots. It is a very vibrant, nicely colored top. I ordered the 4-5t, and it fits true to size. The fabric is a lot thinner than I was expecting for a sweatshirt. The description says it is a sweatshirt for most seasons like autumn, winter, and spring; however, it is not thick and feels more like regular t-shirt material. It is a cute shirt, though I would not recommend it for warmth as it does not feel like a sweatshirt. It is also 100% cotton, so be sure to keep that in mind when washing and drying, as it could shrink. The instructions recommend you hang dry it to avoid shrinkage. It isn’t an overly soft or stretchy shirt, but I love the design and colors. 4-stars!",
