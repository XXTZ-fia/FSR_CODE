The black does attract fur from my white long haired cat but not as bad as some other materials.

WriterUp,Oversized is an Understatement,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15E7JUN8SHOLC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BMVKN995,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 11, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Stripes White,Verified Purchase,"I got this today. I'm still on the fence. Pros: Nice fabric; not too heavy, not too light Overall, I like the stripes. It feels like you borrowed your boyfriend's sweatshirt, only this one you could wear to a nice restaurant with leggings and be fashionably ok. Or you could just hang out at home and not have to worry about sucking your tummy in. You can't see it in this sweater. Cons: It's VERY boxy and VERY oversized. Maybe that's a pro. Depends on how you view it. I don't think downsizing would work because the sleeves and neck size are fine. Debatables: I read the reviews about the seams on the outside. They are on the shoulders. I don't really have a problem with that. It gives a slight definition to your shoulders - almost like the days of shoulder pads but not that pronounced. However, I could see why traditionalists wouldn't like that type of seam. I guess I would say it's stylish sloppy comfy. One or two of those options in the closet isn't a bad idea when you don't feel like working real hard at impressing who is or isn't looking at you.",3
