I got my typical size, medium, and it fits, but is a little on the tighter side. I think this is how it is meant to fit though so I will keep it. Also, it is slightly cropped, but with higher waisted Shorts or pants you could also cover your stomach. The fit seems to be snug enough that it will stay in position, but did not seem to pinch at my armpits, which is something that I look for in this type of top. Very pleased with this and looking forward to wearing it.",3
