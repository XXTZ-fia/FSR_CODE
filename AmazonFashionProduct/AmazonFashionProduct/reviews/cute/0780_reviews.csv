I think I have ordered two or three items in the past and each and every time, they have arrived worn out and used. I don't have many good things to say unfortunately. The dress is short as others have noted.  If you are taller than 5'3"" or 5'4"" it is more of a bulky sweater, not a dress. I'm 5'9"" and there is no way this thing is long enough.  It arrived used, the sleeves were stretched out and so was the hem. It was wadded up in a ball in a return bag and it smelled very strongly of someone's sandalwood perfume. It also had a couple of large holes in it as well. It is pretty apparent that someone wore it and somehow put some holes in it and decided they didn't want it anymore.  As for the quality, the color is more of a Heather grey than a dark grey. The weave is pretty thin- you can see right through the sweater. The material is also very scratchy and feels like it would be super uncomfortable to wear.",
