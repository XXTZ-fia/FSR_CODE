It's more of a lightweight sweatshirt material but has no ""bubbling"" that is typical of these. It is also more of a dark brown than a black. The embroidery is nice for the words ""little boo"". I don't think the fabric is the highest quality. I will get a few wears out of this for little one around Halloween but thats probably it.",

Snaps at crotch and shoulder make it easy to put on. Size is as expected. Would definitely order again in another color or size.,

ItIsWhatItIsNoMoreNoLess,"Too Small, but Nice Material - Thick and Warm",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14XSQFNS8K5ZP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C9LNCB66,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 11, 2023",Size: 6-12 MonthsColor: Blue,,"This runs a little small, but if you order a size up, you should be ok. Well worth the sizing for the warmth and comfort. The material is like a very soft fleece-like. Looks great. Very high quality shirt/onesie overall. Lettering is attached to be very durable for much longer than 2 or 3 kids can wear it. Sizing isn't obvious on the shirt tag so if you do pass it along, you'll just have to guess at the size. Mine came with a tag that just says 90. No clue what that means. I should add the snaps are also heavy duty. It comes with snaps on the left shoulder and the crotch area. The material is so thick that snapping can be a little difficult, especially if you have a squirmy baby, like mine. Some determination can overcome that slight drawback.",
