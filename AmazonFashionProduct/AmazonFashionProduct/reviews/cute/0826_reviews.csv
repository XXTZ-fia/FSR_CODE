She didn't like how much pink it had in it. The great part is that we both wear the same size, so I was able to take it off her hands, happily!! I just LOVE this sweater! It looks great with a pair of super light blue jeans! I ordered my usual size, which is XL, and it fits perfectly.  At its full price of $30, this top is well worth it for its quality. Currently though, it's an additional 35% off, making it only $19.50!! That is just incredible, and I would snatch up as many of the designs as you can that you like! I absolutely Highly Recommend this beautiful and trendy sweater!!  I hope My Review has been Helpful!! 😄👍",

Kim,Cute. Fun but Doesn't Play Well With Others!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SMJD6IMEMBCN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D62DSNBY,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 10, 2024",,,"This sweater has a thick almost felt-like knit. (See close up shot of texture.) Tag states it's 30% polyester, 26% viscose, 24% acrylic and 20% polyamide. Best part, tag also says you can machine wash cold, in a laundry bag, so 5 stars for low maintenance on caring for this warm sweater. I tried this sweater on with multiple coats and vests. I couldn't find a single one that seemed to go well with this sweater, so for that reason I'll say she ""doesn't play well with others"" but this sweater looks great with a hat! For whatever reason, this sweater reminds me of something you might find on Emily in Paris... It's fun and colorful! I ordered small and the fit is just okay. (I'm 5'1“ 117lbs, broad shoulders and solid 34B for reference.) I would have preferred this sweater to be a little shorter and a little wider on the bottom. If you're average height I'm sure the length would be better, but for me it was just slightly too long. I think it's better not to tuck this sweater in because then you lose the white trim detail at the bottom which ties in nicely with the cuffs and collar.  I had to steam out some creases in this sweater when it arrived. It seems to crease easily for some reason, which is strange because it's a dense thick knit? These small critiques aside, if you're looking for a fun, flirtatious something to give your fall wardrobe a pop of color this might just be your sweater! UPDATE: Hey! This doubles as a fun snow bunny-esqe ski sweater. Sporting this sweater for the daily skin up our backyard ski hill in about 32 degree temps and it kept me warm enough on the up and thought it added somesnow bunny meets retro ski chick flair!",5
