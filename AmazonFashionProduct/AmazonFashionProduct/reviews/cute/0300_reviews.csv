This is stunning! I ordered a size medium in the khaki shade and to say im obsessed is putting it lightly. It fits oversized, so I’d size down one. It has gorgeous gold buttons & the cutest neckline detail. This looks high end and kept me warm tonight while not having too much weight on me. It felt and fit just right!  Update: I ordered this in black as well because I loved the khaki so much, but the buttons on the black came very discolored; a little green and flaky looking - disappointing! Also has areas that seem like they’ll fall apart quickly. I think this may be a hit or miss, but so far my khaki one is 10 times better than the black.",

I read the reviews and while some said the buttons would tarnish others said it hasn’t for them, yet at least. Upon receiving my sweater today I opened it and the some buttons were green, some were tarnished, or rubbing off. Let me say this was not the main reason I returned this, I knew these gold buttons would do that after a wash or two but I would’ve still like to have worn this a couple times with good looking buttons. The other thing that’s a personal bother for me is the wrist area is not stretchable and I’m someone who likes it loose so I can roll up the sleeves and adjust however I need to.",3

A Big Family,Soft but…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30WHJ73FA7LUB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8VY69GN,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 28, 2024",Color: BlackSize: Small,,The sweater itself is soft and looks nice at first glance. It’s a good amount of oversized and once on it does give a good shape. After wearing awhile the fabric blend starts to become obvious as in it gets a little itchy and in areas like wear my shoulder bag strap rests and the underarms area starts to pill from all the movement. Washed and dried in a laundry bag to help preserve the sweater but overall I don’t see this holding up for a long term type of use.,7

This is just interesting. My 17 year old picked this out and upon first trying it on declared herself to be a marshmallow. Do not, I repeat, do not attempt to wear the sweater buttoned. It definitely elevates the sweater to unbutton it and allow it to drape. The sleeves are comically short when you first see them because the body is so wide, but once on that proportion isn't as obvious. Definitely size down. This is not made for long arms. My daughter is a size 0/2 5'7"" and the sleeves are nearly long enough. The color is more ivory than white and the fabric is very soft.",12

The design is unique and the gold buttons make a big fashion statement. If you like super big cozy sweaters in the Fall or Winter -- consider this one!,

I purposely ordered it in an extra-large so that it would fit more relaxed and loosely.  Larger pockets in front are great for a cell-phone or to keep your hands warm.  I see this sweater being matched with a tee shirt and a pair of skinny jeans and making a casual comfortable outfit for going into town.  It's summer right now as I write this review but I can already anticipate this sweater being warm for the upcoming fall/winter seasons.",

And in a sense, it is. It's 100% polyester so it's not as ""soft"" as it could be (but it is NOT scratchy in ANY way whatsoever), but it's comfortable. And it's WARM. It's a good weave on this sweater. It's built bulky, in that it's a loose fit. I got the khaki color so it's an offwhite and khaki color striped. That neutral is perfect to match with SO many things.  There's no collar in the way, and the cuffs on the sleeves fit well for me. I have GREAT range of motion in it, love that it's a loose fit. The length is good on me, too. The knit on it is really tight and hence the sweater is super warm and cozy. Love that. I would wear this in the fall, winter, OR the spring, which makes it a good year-round sweater for me. The pockets are a wonderful addition.  The tag is on the inside left side seam of it and scratchy, but because you'll be wearing a shirt for sure you likely won't really feel it. I don't. Apparently you should hand wash this or machine wash cold. Do not bleach. Lay flat or hang to dry.  Overall this sweater was a wonderful surprise. The loose fit is so comfortable and it has pockets! It's warm and cozy and beautifully made. You CAN machine wash cold. I'm sold. Recommend.",

The sweater is cozy and comfortable. It fits as expected. The only thing that I’m not crazy about is that it’s dry, clean only, but I believe you can wash it in the machine on a cold setting. I would not put it in the dryer. this sweater will look great with jeans and a cute top. I can’t wait for winter so I can wear it.",
