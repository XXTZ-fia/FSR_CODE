Twinpossible,Absolutely adorable set for new babies 👶 🥰 👍!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29AI2ZS3207X8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D961SH9H,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 12, 2024",Color: Green+flowerpantSize: 0-3 Months,,"This is the cutest, lil set I’ve seen for baby girls in awhile. It’s a 3 piece set & after dressing up 3 girls to the 9’s for YEARS, this is something I’d buy in a heartbeat for them & with my vast experience on store brands vs. boutique brands, for $19.99 for a set that leans towards ‘boutique’ quality, aesthetics, style & detailing... it’s a fashionably adorable & SMART buy. The headband is included, which never happened with the super pricy sets I bought. It was always a separate expense.  Even though my baby days are over, I create reborn dolls, and this one is impressively lovely & made very well. It’s a heavy thin to semi thick, if that makes sense, but not too thick of a fabric. Perfect for late summer or chilly summer nights, into fall & especially, all of spring.  SO cute & worth the cost 💲!  5 stars ✨! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  ** I hope my review has been helpful to you 😊! **",
