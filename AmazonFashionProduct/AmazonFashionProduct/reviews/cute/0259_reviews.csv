I was nervous the thin straps would snap during pilates, but it held up perfectly and was super comfortable. No bulging, no nips showing. Excellent overall, even better than those I tried in stores. I ordered two more in other colors, and may order more if they also work well. In a way, I like that there are no strap adjusters because it doesn't poke or pinch when you lay flat on your back during exercise.

It was very soft. After wearing it for several hours the band under my armpit starts to hurt. It also leaves imprints because of the way they stitched the seam. They made where the fabric comes together like double the thickness of the rest of it. Just seems like an odd way of finishing the seam. May size up next time so it doesn't hurt me as much. Other than that great product. Would buy again,

I haven't needed to replace a sports bra in a couple years so maybe I missed the transition, but I'm frustrated. As somebody who suffers from chronic pain, I can't handle a waist band that's too tight.
