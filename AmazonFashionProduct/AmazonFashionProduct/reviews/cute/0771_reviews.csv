That’s the kind of thing I value in a pair of pseudo-pajamas.  They wash pretty well.  I can see them wearing out pretty quick if i keep washing them a lot.  It’s not like they are made of super high quality fabric.  But I purchased a few different colors and I switch out.  They run slightly baggy.  And I will add that they are very thin material so they aren’t the best for going out in the snow.  Other than that, highly recommend.
