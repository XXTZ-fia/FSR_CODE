I have bought 7 only to find that Artfish must have changed suppliers. The new long tank tops are shorter than the original. Yes, I ordered the long and not the short version. Also, they are now, 46% cotton, 46% rayon and 8% spandex. The originals were 65% cotton and 35% polyester. I live in Florida and like a higher cotton content because it is cooler. I'll probably keep the new ones because I do like the style and fit but I will be on the lookout for the same style tank tops with a higher cotton content. I gave this 3 stars. If it had been the original version, I would have given it 5 stars.",
