Lisa J. Rief,COTTON work out tank!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25O88LA1YYZ9L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCNCB5GH,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 26, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Tie Dye Smoke Ink,Verified Purchase,"It was great to find a cotton work out tank!! So much more comfortable for exercising, and less sweaty. I use mine for a cardio class. I had a little trouble finding the right size. I am 140 lbs and 5’2” and usually wear a medium in tops. The mediums I got were a tad small, so ordered Large. The large was fine in one of the tops, but too big in another. Sizes don’t seem to be consistent. I did keep one, and returned a couple when I found one that fit right. I love the black marbled one. It’s very pretty. Except for the sizing issues, I love these tops.",
customer,Runs Very Large,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKIRV6U6S3YHU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCNCB5GH,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 22, 2024",Size: XX-SmallColor: Mortar Color,Verified Purchase,"I was heartened by another review that spoke of the XXS fitting well, so I ordered them, but my experience was not the same. I got 5 tanks. For reference, I am 5'0"", 90lbs. They were so incredibly large on me, I thought for sure I was sent the wrong size, but they were all labelled XXS. Now of course I would expect them to be long on me as I am short, but the problem was actually that they were just overall very big.  I have some similar tanks from old navy in petite XS that are my favorite and these XXS's are much, much larger than those, and ON's are already a bit big. These XXS's fit more like a small in any other active brand I've tried, so I'd say probably 2 sizes too big. I don't know if the mis-sizing scales linearly with sizes (i.e., whether or not the other sizes also run so egregiously large), but if you are usually an XXS in, say, beyond yoga or athleta, these will probably not fit.  I'll also add that according to their size chart, they should have fit me as I have pretty much the exact measurements for waist and hips that they list for XXS (actually mine are 0.5"" larger). Extremely frustrating that there is such a discrepancy.  All that said, the material is soft and the colors are nice.",

Sure feels like it is to me and I've sewn and worked with lots of fabrics in my time. The 8 percent elastane insures it doesn't consistent shape. I'm using these for hiking and working out. They are great shirts.  Yes, they can be slightly wrinkled after washing and hanging dry. But I'd rather wear cotton than some weird plastic fabric. I'd buy these any time over lululemon. There's a great color selection from pastels to brights. The green jade is particularly gorgeous.",6
