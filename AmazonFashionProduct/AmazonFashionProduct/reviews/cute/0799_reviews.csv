They fit perfectly, are SO comfortable, and the material is soft but sturdy. It’s like getting to wear pajama pants to work. My only complaint is they are wayyy too long for my 5’1” self.

Still worth it, but it was enough to take a star off.",

I wonder if the mocha brown color might have a different sizing than other colors because, there is no way the XL is true to size! It was at least two sizes too small in the waist and hips, especially for having elastic! The measurement for waist size must have been taken with the elastic stretched to maximum. Or maybe mine is mislabeled? Even the length is shorter than it is supposed to be. I might try again and see what happens in another color and the same color.",4
