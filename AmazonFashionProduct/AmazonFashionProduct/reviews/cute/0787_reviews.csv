I am 5'6, 148lbs, 36D and ordered a medium.  I also ordered it in Green.  I love everything about it, other than the is too big for my liking.  I prefer things to be more fitted and this is too big and boxy on me.  I'm really hoping the small works because it is really cute and different.  I'm also going to get it in another color as the green shade didn't look great against my skin tone, but it is a really nice green. I can't wait to get it in a small!",
