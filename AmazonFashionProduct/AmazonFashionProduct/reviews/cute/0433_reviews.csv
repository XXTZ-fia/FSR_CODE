I usually wear an xl but decided to size up to xxl mainly because I have a larger butt and skirts are always short in the back. Sizing up helped with that.  I do note that the shorts underneath are a great quality of material but my large thighs make them roll up but that’s okay because you can’t see it when wearing the skirt.  The waist band is a tiny bit tight even tho I sized up, so if you have a more curvy sized body and usually wear xl then I would suggest sizing up just to make sure it’s not too small.  Overall it’s very cute and flattering def suggest buying if you are looking for a cute skirt with shorts under it, fabric material is very soft and comfy as well",6
