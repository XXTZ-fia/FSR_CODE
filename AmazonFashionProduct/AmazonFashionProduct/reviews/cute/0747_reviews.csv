The color was true to the image and the fabric quality was great. I’m usually a medium in blouses, but I am tall (5’9”) and have an athletic build with long arms so I went up a size and bought a large to make sure the shoulders and arms were a good fit, and I’m happy I did because it ended up being a better fit for my chest as well (34C). The body is fitted enough that it still fit comfortably snug in the waist and accentuated all the right places without being bulky - in fact it actually fit me just like the model in the photos which was a pleasant surprise! I’ve worn it tucked into a black leather skirt and dress pants, and it looks great dressed up but would be cute with jeans too.",

I did notice quite a bit of pilling in the fabric and wish I had stuck to a line dry only or very low heat /short time in the dryer to avoid this.

I’m always hesitant when it comes to ordering clothing online because it’s a gamble when it comes to the fit or item quality. Amazon recommended a large based on my size; however, I went with a medium instead after reading reviews on this brand’s typical sizing. First off, I 100% made the right call on the medium. As you can see, it’s more of a form-fitting sweater, but it’s so comfortable because the fabric has quite a bit of stretch to it. The fabric itself is thick and consists of a viscose/polyester blend, so it’s soft and isn’t itchy at all. In fact, it’s better quality than I expected it to be! The twisted knit front gives the sweater a really feminine look, so it makes it easy to take this sweater from day to night. In addition, the nutmeg color was accurate to how it was depicted online, and overall, it’s just a lovely color especially for the fall months. The only thing I can’t speak to is how this sweater will hold up after washing, particularly the twisted knot in front. Hopefully, it holds its shape well, so I’ll have to update my review if I notice anything wonky. Overall, I really like this sweater considering the price point, and I would happily buy from this brand again. I predict that I will get a lot of use of it out of it, and I look forward to wearing it more once the weather cools off a bit.",13

Taking it out of the package, I could immediately feel how thick and soft the material of this sweater was.

Stitching looks great overall, although I am not a huge fan of the seam that runs across the breast area.  I was a little worried at first because the sweater looked small and I wasn't sure it was going to fit, but it stretches out to fit your body. I think it manages to be fitted but still flattering, but if you want a looser fit, you should size up. If you are a little chestier, you may also want to size up if you don't like the super plunge look on a top.  Sleeve length is a little long, but I think that's intentional so you can cuff them. Just noting this for those who don't like that look, but I am a fan.  I really like this sweater, and I'll be asking for additional colors for my birthday!",7
