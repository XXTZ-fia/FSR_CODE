But due to the remote area I live (no UPS drop off) I am not able to return the product so I will save it for a different season. I already ordered up. I would suggest ordering two sizes up in you are using it for the winter.,7

It could be a stand alone piece, but honestly I think it's just best for layering seeing as how it's basic, thin, and lined. The furry lining is warm and plush and luckily the same color as the sweater itself so rolling the sleeves up won't look super weird or anything. Only thing of note is what I already put in the title, which is that the mock neck sits higher up on the neck than it looks like it will based on the product photos provided. It goes up high enough to hit almost like my other turtlenecks, only it doesn't need to be rolled down. Definitely overpriced; would probably only pay $20 for a sweater like this otherwise.",

The sweaters came nicely packaged, no weird smells, and are really nice quality. They are nicely sewn and didn't have any flaws. They are incredibly soft and comfortable. If you're tall, the sleeves are long and they actually come all the way down to my hands (which is super rare for me). I have a shorter torso and this fits me as I would want for length. It fits true to size and is very warm! It looks like a sweater with a half turtleneck. Just like what is pictured. The sweater in green didn't do me a lot of favors. It was a really pretty green color, looked just like it did on screen and I loved the look of it off! However on, for me, it was more something for comfort and warmth. The black one looks a lot better on me and more stylish. Still I love these tops and if you're looking for something soft, warm, and nice this is it!",3

It hugs my body a bit more than I like. I was between sizes and went lower .... not a good idea if you don't want a body hugging sweater.  It's well made and I really like the thermal lining. Perfect for a fall or winter hike or as a layer for winter sports (but it is WARM, so don't layer too much on top of it).",

She isn't a fan of cold winter days/night. I am always looking for sweaters, blankets, shoes that will keep her warm. She ordered her regular size and it does fit but she feels she should have sized up for a little looser fit. This sweater is a knit that is fleece Sherpa lined and is thick and stretchy. It is a heavy garment that is well made and you can feel the quality of the product. The sweater is soft, very warm and comfortable. It came really wrinkled and she will probably have to stream press the sweater to get the wrinkles out. We go camping in our RV quite often and this sweater will be perfect for her to wear during the cold nights around the campfire.",
B.B.,Super comfy and warm,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38SCS6ALW2NF1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBVDSH5H,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 19, 2024",Color: OatsSize: X-Large,,"This thermal really blurs the line between a sweater and a thermal, and I love that about it! It’s surprisingly heavier than I expected, but in a good way. The soft, fluffy lining feels amazing and really adds to its cozy warmth. It came vacuum packed, so it was full of creases, but a quick steam took care of those. The fabric is thick, stretchy, and is perfect to wear with jeans, etc., making it a great choice for casual days.  I love that it’s true to size, with sleeves that are the perfect length. The mock neck is also a nice touch—it's not tight, and while it’s not lined like the rest of the interior, it still provides good coverage. I actually appreciate that difference. It feels great worn on its own, thanks to the fuzzy interior, but it’s also perfect for layering. Plus, it’s easy to care for—just toss it in the wash with cold water and hang to dry.  Overall, this thermal is perfect if you're looking for something warm and comfortable.",7

It is a knit that is lined with fleece and has the stretchiness of a knit, combined with the warmth of fleece.  It is a heavy garment and you can see and feel the quality of the product.  Most people will probably think that the sweater runs small; I usually wear an X-Small and this Small fits me perfectly, making it a 0-2 size.  However, I am thrilled with it.  The sweater is hip length and the sleeves have tasteful cuffs.  It would be fine to wear as a dressy garment, perhaps with wool slacks, but also great with jeans.  I ordered the rust color and love the richness of the shade.  I can't wait for it to get cold where I live so that I can wear it.",2

About the size, so I ordered a small, which is the smallest available size, my bust size is 36, waist 29 and hips 33. this sweater is a relaxed fit on me, so it doesn't hug the body. So I'm thinking if you're a few inches bigger than me, this will be nicely hugging your body, it you are my size or smaller it would be a more relaxed fit, however it still looks and feels good.",5
