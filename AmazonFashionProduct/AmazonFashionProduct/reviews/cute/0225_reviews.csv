When I took them out of the package they had a really strong and weird smell that takes a couple washes to get out. They're also not super flattering, I have tube tops from skims, aritzia and even amazon that contour my body perfectly, these are kind of boxy. A good thing about these tube tops is that they're a thick material if that's what you're looking for. They also have a band at the top that keeps the tube tops from slipping down however if you sweat or wear it too long, they do start hurting!",

The tops are thick and great quality for an Amazon top. I don't have to wear a bra with these and I got a Large (I am 36C). Very comfortable, I've worn them around at home. They are really cute and they are both my school colors so I got lots of compliments on them when I wore them to home games. The black does not fade with washes, and I've washed them after every use. I would recommend washing on a delicate cycle and hang drying. True to size, I would get your normal shirt size for a normal fit and size down for a tighter fit. The non-slip detail on the top of the shirt works very well, I really didn't think it would. This is why I feel like I didn't need to size down. Highly recommend, will be buying in more colors next summer.",2
