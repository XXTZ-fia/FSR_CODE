Amy,Fit is okay but see through,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12V9XUI1FQ21U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DQCZ4YS4,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 2, 2025",Color: WhiteSize: X-Large,,See through for shape and color. The ruffle is a little to cutesy... more so than I thought it would be. Seems true to size.,

Blue Skies,An upgrade from a regular t-shirt!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1U229MAQKH5PH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DQCZ4YS4,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 26, 2025",Color: WineredSize: Small,,"Pleasantly surprised with this trendy t-shirt. At this price point, I am amazed at how soft the t-shirt fabric is - has a slight stretch to it that helps it maintain a nice flattering shape at all times. I particularly like the addition of the ruffles on the sleeves - just the right amount in my opinion. I ordered the Small and the fit is spot on, so I would say that sizing runs true to size. I am 5'3"", 108 lbs for reference. I plan to get a lot of wear from this top. Cannot beat the quality and style for the price!!!!",4
JenWI,Nice for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LLCW4OOJRUM5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DQCZ4YS4,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 26, 2025",Color: WineredSize: Large,,"I received the shirt in wine red.  I found the photos to be very accurate as far as the color. For the price, this is a nice shirt.  Soft material; a little thin but with the darker color it’s not see-through when on.I found it true to size.  I go between L and XL. The Large definitely fit but again with the weight of the fabric I might have been more comfortable sizing up to the XL so it wouldn’t hug my curves.  Still, it fits nice enough and I’ll get some use out of this shirt in the summer for work, since it can easily dress up with a nice pant.",
MJ,Perfect Size and Cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E309TK4U6VKW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DQCZ4YS4,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Medium,,I recieved the product for a review. Its good. I like the stitching and the fabric is soft. The ruffles are a little bigger than I wanted but overall it looks good on. Will be perfect for spring wear at the office.,
Sydney J,Very cute and soft,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3J0YGT2689C4T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DQCZ4YS4,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Color: GreenSize: Medium,,"This t-shirt is really nice. It is very soft, is a very pretty shade that matches the color in the product description, is stretchy, and is comfortable to wear. I thought the sizing was pretty true to size as well. I typically wear either a medium or large and I tried out a medium and it fit pretty well. For reference I’m around 150 lbs and 5 ft 2 in.",
