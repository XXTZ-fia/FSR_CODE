When I got my replacement order, I got the correct item.I removed a star for the situation and the wait.  However, the top is wonderful and I love it. I typically wear a medium in any top- I'm 5'7"" and 137 lbs. 34C.  I ordered this in a large based on reviews it fits perfectly.  It's extremely comfortable. The fabric is high quality, and buttery soft. I love the double layer of the fabric! It's not at all see through, and just more comfortable than most tanks. The square neck gives it a very sexy look on the decolatage area. Spelled that wrong I think. If you're busy at all, or wear a push up bra with it... wow! My husband loves it! The fabric has a significant amount of stretch and holds nice to the body. It doesn't look all wrinkly along the main body area, which I like. It IS shorter than the average, but it isn't a crop top. I would say it comes down (on me) right to where the top of a pair of regular jeans would land on the waist. I got the black one but will be ordering more colors now that I've worn it. As long as I receive the correct top in unused condition, I will be very happy. I recommend trying it! Order a size larger than usual for a good fit though.",

It does show the tummy a tiny bit but if you’ve got a flat tummy, it looks great. Great color and great tight fit. Stretchy material. Definitely needs nipple covers because you can see the shape under the top. But if you’ve put on a bra, the straps show. Maybe a strapless bra would work but I don’t like wearing those. Will have to get a tube top to wear underneath or go without. But it looks amazing and hugs my curves. Would love one in every color.",3
