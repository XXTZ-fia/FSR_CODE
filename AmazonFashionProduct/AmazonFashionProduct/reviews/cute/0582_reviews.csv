MissBee,"Soft, warm and cozy",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R143R79QXIX96T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBKXCMR8,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 23, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Brown,,"This is a cozy fleece sweatshirt for lounging around the house on crisp autumn or chilly winter days/nights. It's also a nice weight for hiking in cooler weather. You can stash your keys or another small item in the little chest pocket although there are also hand pockets in this sweatshirt which is convenient. You would not be able to fit anything large in that little pocket; definitely not a cell phone. I do like the hand pockets over the pouch style pocket for looks as well as seurity. I always feel like items will fall out of the pouch pocket.  It does seem to be well made and the contrasting hem, pocket, collar and plaquette edging is good looking. The hem is elasticized and creates a little bit of a bubble effect at the bottom but it is not tight at all around the hips but I guess that depends on your body shape. I haven't washed it yet but the directions recommend that you do not put this is in the dryer. I'm giving 4 stars because I think it's a tad overpriced.",
