The shorts were awful. Like you'd think they were made for SpongeBob they were so square. The shirt was cute but already had stray strings coming off of it unraveling.

Shorts have button, zipper, and pockets. Would be a perfect outfit for a dinosaur themed birthday. The 18-24 month size is too big for my 17 month old, so hopefully he'll grow into it by this summer.",
Mindy Sze,Cute but mediocre quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R161O0NYAVG8TP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8VH6BV7,"2.0 "," the United States "," February 8, 2024",Size: 5-6 YearsColor: Blue Dinosaur,,My child loves dinosaurs so this outfit appealed to him. This would be a warmer weather outfit and makes dressing simple. However the material is very mediocre. Both the top and bottom says cotton but the feel of the fabric does not seem like cotton. Both were very thin and the top was can see-through in the light. Also the stitching was not snipped off or finished neatly.,
Jordan Rhees,Cute but on the cheaper quality  end,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3169MITUYDF79/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D8VH6BV7,"3.0 "," the United States "," February 4, 2024",Size: 0-6 MonthsColor: Khaki,,"Our newest addition is expected to arrive in early May, so we are still adding to his wardrobe.  While it’s cute , the material is very thin and see through and very cheap quality. There aren’t any snags or strings hanging loose like other sets I’ve ordered and the elastic waist band is pretty decent. The color is a lot different than the description as well.  Not my favorite order but we will still use it!",

It's going to be perfect. It fits her nicely; it's a little large, but I ordered it that way because it's still winter. By the time summer arrives, it should be the perfect size. It's well-made and nicely put together. We love the little pockets and the drawstrings, too. I know it's advertised as a boy's outfit, but I think it works for boys and girls.",

I've been ordering things in neutral colors, I just feel that laundry is so much easier and faster when most of the clothes are the same color palette! I ordered this one in a 6-12 month, which is a huge range for sizing. That said, the fit is definitely on the larger side so closer to that 9 - 12 month. The fabric is soft, albeit a bit thin, but I don't think it'll be an issue. Kids grow so fast, especially at this stage that buying expensive or high quality garments would just be a waste of money. Plus kids are always getting dirty and this outfit just washes so easily, no special instructions or care required. It's pretty well made, I didn't see and loose threads, rips, holes, or uneven seams. The checkered pattern is a nice welcome change from the solid top and matching bottoms I've seen as well and the chest pocket is adorable!",
