I loooooooved the material. It felt thick, buttery, silky and smooth. Right after I bought it, they went up in price to $20. It stayed like that for 2 months, so now on prime day I decided to restock and get the black while and grey and they were def not the same fabric.  They’re a lot lighter and less shape shifting. Not sure why it’s inconsistent. The seller has another shirt listing similar to this one that is usually 14.99 (prime day price for the ones I got) and I bought it last month hoping it’d be similar to the coffee/green shirt even though they were cheaper. The shirts I bought were delivered today and they felt extremely similar to the ones that are regularly 14.99.",2

The material is soft and provides a flattering fit, hugging you in all the right places. However, I'm removing one star because it’s not 100% cotton, so it’s not the most breathable fabric. Made in China, the shirt is crafted from 88% polyester and 12% spandex. While it offers great stretch and durability, keep in mind:  Polyester: Durable and wrinkle-resistant, but less breathable than natural fabrics like cotton. It tends to trap heat and moisture.  Spandex: Adds excellent stretch and a form-fitting design, though it restricts airflow and contributes to a less breathable feel.  Overall, it's a great shirt for comfort and fit—just be mindful of the material if you prefer more breathability.",6
