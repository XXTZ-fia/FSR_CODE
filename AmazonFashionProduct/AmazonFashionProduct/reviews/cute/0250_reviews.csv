First, the fit was a bit off. The cardigan is described as loose and relaxed, but it ended up being too boxy and unflattering on me. The sleeves felt a little too wide and long, and the overall shape made me look frumpy rather than stylish. I was hoping for something more chic and comfy for layering, but this just didn’t work for my body type.  The material is also a letdown. While it’s marketed as chunky knit, the fabric feels surprisingly thin and not as warm as I expected. The knit is loosely woven, and after a few wears, it started to stretch out and lose its shape. It wasn’t as cozy as I thought it would be, especially for fall and winter wear.  Additionally, the buttons felt flimsy and didn’t seem to hold up well after a few uses. I noticed them loosening, which was disappointing considering how expensive it was.  Overall, this cardigan didn’t meet my expectations for both comfort and style. It may work for someone else, but I won’t be reaching for it again anytime soon. There are definitely better options for a cozy, flattering cardigan out there.",9

I can create the cutest outfits with these sweaters, which I have and worn them to work, an outside event, and even at home! I have also fallen asleep wearing them and they are extremely cozy, comfy, and they keep me warm. When I purchased these, it was during summer, which my work's building can get quite chilly. I am now excited for the holidays, which I now get to style for. I cannot stop wearing them and I will never regret this purchase. If you do decide to purchase these sweater cardigans, make sure to take really good care of them through wash cycles. They are strong and sturdy but I recommend a very safe and delicate fabric softener too soften them up a bit through drying as I have ran mine through the wash more than a dozen times (still in perfect shape and condition) but got a little stiff.
