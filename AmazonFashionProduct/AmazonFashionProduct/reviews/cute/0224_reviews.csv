I may iron on a team logo and jersey number on the sleeve stripe.  I ordered it in size medium and the color ""gray"", which has white contrasting trim.This color block sweatshirt is very thick.  The outside is a smooth knit and the inside fleece is soft and fuzzy.  The oversized fit is also quite boxy.  Compared to other oversized items I have, I feel like this is a little bit disproportionately wide -  If I went up a size for more length, the additional width would be way too much.  But that's just me.  It's made of 50-50 cotton and polyester.  I washed and dried it with my regular ""lights"".It's a stylish and good quality sweatshirt. I did not see any loose threads of mis-sewn seams.",8

This block colored sweatshirt in black and tan is very comfortable and is a nice length. The black wrists and the black stripe down the sleeves creates a nice look. This casual look works with jeans, black slacks or leggings. This is a really nice sweatshirt to wear to work as I work in retail. It is machine washable which I really like.",

The cuffs are robbed and fit comfortably around my wrists, not feeling too loose. Overall, it’s a thick good quality sweatshirt that is well made and is worth the price.",

This is everything a sweatshirt should be….soft, comfortable, warm, oversized to perfection, and good looking. I usually wear a L in tops but per the size chart went with a Medium and it’s spot on. Love the color blocking, gives the sweatshirt visual interest. The only way they could have made this any better is if it had a front pocket but I’m not complaining🙂",

Loose, but not so much that it gets in my way of free movement. This is a true sweatshirt with soft fleece on the inside of it. Nice and thick for good warmth in colder days to come. It was a lot too warm for the summer temperatures that I had the day I tried this on and took the photos! Despite the thickness of the material, it is not overly heavy in weight, and that makes it super comfy to wear. It is well made and doesn't have loose threads or other flaws that I could see.  I really like this sweatshirt. So much so that I have ordered another in a different color! The price listed on the product page is definitely fair and the sweatshirt is worth it. I highly recommend this sweatshirt.",

I maybe should have sized up for the super roomy oversized fit - I got my normal size and while it is not tight by any means it just looks kinda puffy.

KinDC,"Disappointing quality, poorly cut, and not flattering",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MN0XFYVOGQ99/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBZCSKBK,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 13, 2024",Color: PinkSize: Small,,"I love oversized sweatshirts and have a large collection of them, so I grabbed this one as soon as I saw it. I ordered a small, which is my usual size in these types of sweatshirts, and it does fit similarly to others.  Unfortunately, though, it turned out to look better online than in person and the cut even seems to be different than what's depicted. The banding at the bottom is tighter than the cut at the top of the garment, which creates an odd and very unflattering shape with bulky shoulders and slimmer hip area (rather than what's shown in the listing pictures).  Cutting and stitching is also unevenly done, which causes the neckline to pucker weirdly and not lay right. Some of the seams don't line up as they should, and noticeably so, and sewing is done inconsistently, so some seams move from one side to the other, which creates odd puckering and puffing in places. The stripes on the arms are also unevenly cut so that they're thicker in parts and thinner in others, and again, noticeably so.  The pink color is far more muted and less interesting than it appears online, and not a color I would've ordered if the pictures were true to reality.  Care instructions are also not as friendly as I would’ve liked. I was careful to choose a sweatshirt that was machine washable since I hate hand washing those. This one technically is, as claimed, but requires cold water, which means it essentially will need to be run separately from my other clothes or hand washed.  The only positives I could find are that the sweatshirt material is thick and the lining is soft and fuzzy, but given I won't be wearing something this poorly done, those are moot points.  Bottom line, I don't recommend this at all. It's poorly made for the most part, and I can't imagine it will look good on many people.",5
