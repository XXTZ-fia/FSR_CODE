The only drawback we have encountered: we did have some of the material that is sewn parallel to the zipper come unsewn, although I suppose wear and tear is bound to happen. Not sure if it’s a quality issue or just normal from a baby tugging at it. I have also noticed when he crawls his legs come out of the leg holes and start to go up into the torso section of the pajamas, which I think in part is due to how stretchy the fabric is.  My baby is a very small 10 month old, only 18.5 pounds, and he is still fitting into the 6-9 month size, for reference. And I think he will get another month or more out of this size.",
