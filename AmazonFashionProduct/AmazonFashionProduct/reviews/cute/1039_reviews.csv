Lover of All Things Beauty,Nice basic long sleeve with a little extra given the wrists!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTKZMHUFYT8L3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBP4R35Y,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 3, 2024",Color: Light BrownSize: Medium,,"This comes in a sealed bag that’s vacuum-sealed, so it’s pretty wrinkly when it first arrives.  This is a stretchy, silky feeling shirt. It’s really soft. It is a plain long sleeve shirt with elastic ruffled wrists. The title for this says “Dressy Business Casual Blouses.” This isn’t “dressy.” I can see the “business casual” - you can wear it with a basic skirt or dress pants and it’ll look good. But it isn’t what I’d personally call “dressy.” But, I always take titles of Amazon products from random brands with a grain of salt because they seem to shove in as many words as possible for it to show up in the search results (at least, I assume that’s why). If you look at the actual description for the shirt, it doesn’t say anything about it being “dressy.” It says it’s “long sleeve, crewneck, casual loose style, smocked cuffs add a feminine touch” and “Classic and versatile blouses to style with jeans, trousers or a skirt, throw on a lightweight jacket for an effortless fall look.” I’d agree with those descriptions for it. So if you’re looking for a basic long sleeve shirt that has a little extra added to it, this shirt will work. If you’re looking for something that’s more dressy, I think you’d be disappointed.  The description for this says it has a medium thickness. I don’t agree with that. It’s very thin and lightweight. This isn’t going to be something I’d wear if I’m going to be somewhere that’s cold unless I have a sweater or will be wearing a coat.  I got the medium. A small would’ve been better. I am tall and pretty thin. The medium fits me comfortably. It is loose. I prefer to tuck it in a little like it’s shown in the product photos and it works well for me that way. I feel like it would look a little too loose and big on me if I didn’t wear it that way (which is why a small would’ve been better, then I could’ve worn it either way. But with a medium, the only way I like the way it looks is if it’s tucked in a little in the front). It looks good with jeans for a more casual look, but can also be worn with slightly dressier pants or a skirt for a business casual look. I like that it’s versatile like that.  I got the “Light Brown” color. It looks exactly as shown in the product pics. It is a cooler type brown color, which works great with my fair, cool toned, muted complexion.  It’s really comfortable, the material feels nice. It didn’t have any weird stitching or loose threads. It fits me nicely. I love the color. At the sale price of $11.98 (at the time of writing this review), I think it’s a great price and I’d definitely recommend it. At the regular price of $22.99, I think it’s overpriced. It’s a nice shirt but a basic shirt that I wouldn’t pay $23 for. I give it 4 stars.",

The mauve color is just beautiful and the material is soft.  It is pretty thin material so it will not keep you warm in the winter.  It would be good for spring/fall.  The sleeves are just adorable with tiny ruffles at the wrist level.  It came vacuumed packed so tightly that it was a brick, but the wrinkles mostly came out with just hanging it up for a couple of days.  No funky smell either upon opening the package.  My only issue is that I put it under a long sleeve cardigan with the little ruffles hanging out by my wrist.  Very cute.......but it kept bunching up weird around the front part of my shoulders and sticking out of the sweater weird.  To be fair, maybe it was because I was wearing a sweater over it (?).  I have not worn it just by itself to see if it did the same weird bunching.  It washed nicely in cold water, delicate cycle and I dried it for about 10 minutes on low heat and then air dried from there.  No shrinking that I could tell.  Overall I am happy with the shirt!",

If you are on the far opposite side of the scale like me (5’4 and103 lbs), this can be very disappointing, and it is why I gave this shirt only 4 out 5 stars. I decided to order one anyway, because it is just so dainty and cute, and it was on sale. As expected, the small was quite baggy on me, but the color is nice, the detail on the sleeves very pretty, and the fabric comfortable and stretchy. Great worn casual with leggings, or dressed up a bit with jewelry and jeans or work pants. I have received positive looks and compliments. As for the bagginess, I threw it into the washer and dryer exactly the way I was NOT supposed to, and it shrank nicely into a looser fitting XS. Now it is perfect on me! I think I will take advantage of the discount and buy more colors.",6

I take a medium in this brand, but this top is VERY oversized, so I should have tried a small. It's a big tent, not cut to flatter a woman at all. The sleeves with the elastic are SO loose that you can't style the sleeves as you'd like - they just hang there, and you can't even push them up your arm.  Too much fabric to tuck in, too boxy to leave out.  I like the color and the neckline. That's about it.",

The lightweight material is one of my favorite aspects of this shirt. It feels incredibly soft against the skin, making it comfortable to wear all day long. Despite its lightness, the fabric is durable and holds up well after multiple washes. The gathered sleeves add a unique touch to the overall design, giving the shirt a stylish and slightly whimsical look.  The style of this shirt is both flattering and practical. It pairs well with a variety of bottoms, from jeans to skirts, making it perfect for both casual and slightly dressier occasions. However, I did notice that it runs a little big in the sleeves and around the wrist. This isn’t a major issue for me, but it’s something to keep in mind when choosing your size.

I like the brown shade – it's not too dark but also not khaki. It is a thinner material, but that's perfect for layering. What surprised me the most was how much I enjoyed the sleeves and cuff. Not only are they pretty, but they're also practical for someone like me who almost always finds sleeves too long and has to roll them up.",
Rochelle,Cuffs are not tight at all,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV35KZA9UWMP6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBP4R35Y,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 10, 2024",Color: BurgundySize: X-Large,,"I ordered the burgundy color and think it is a rich plum color. Perfect color for fall. The fabric feels like tee shirt material so it is not bulky. The cuffs make this top a little extra. The cuffs are stretchy and not tight or snug. They don’t leave marks on your arm. I ordered my typical Amazon size of XL. That is also the size I typically order from this brand. However, I felt like it was a bit looser on me than I thought it would be. If you are in between sizes, I suggest ordering down a size instead of up a size.",
