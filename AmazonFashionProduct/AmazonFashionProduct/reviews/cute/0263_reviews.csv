One is in an entirely different fashion than the other, and it's way higher up with a shorter strap, so it's lopsided when you wear it--enough so that half of your whole chest will FALL OUT of the top. The straps are manual ties, and I tried for a good few months to tie it in various ways to offset this but ultimately the difference in the two is not something you can work with.
