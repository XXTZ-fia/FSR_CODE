Glad I did because it fits appropriately oversized as desired. For size reference I’m 5’2 weight 130 lb. I had no problem with length due to the elastic bottom hem. The quality is decent. Yes fabric is nice & thick also fleece lined as indicated but You get what you pay for. Don’t expect high end quality. It’s a bit stiff out of the package so washing with fabric softener should do the trick. Can’t report on pilling yet but I’m sure it’s to be expected over time. Got the color Coffee. It’s slightly off from the picture shown but overall I’m satisfied. Would I buy it again… probably not.,3

This isn’t a big deal for me but thought I’d include that..also could just be because I’ve only washed once….overall highly recommend and will probably get in another color",3
