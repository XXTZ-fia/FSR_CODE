Customer 117,Stretchy But Small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VEL7Z39CEJOM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7RLLZ3K,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 14, 2024",Color: Heather GreySize: X-Large,,"These pants are a really comfortable material and they have lots of stretch. They're a good color and I like how long they are. They fold over on top which is perfect for me since I'm 8 months pregnant. The cons for me are 1. They don't have pockets which is a huge bummer. 2. It's too tight. When it comes to how tight they are, they do stretch enough for me to put on, but I purposefully sized up so that it would be stretchy but almost loose. These are difficult to get on! And when they are on, they feel like they're crushing my crotch and thighs. Even being so pregnant, my legs have actually not grown, just my big belly has gotten bigger. And as I said, I did get a size up on purpose. It does make it uncomfortable to use the bathroom; every time I have to put them on or take them off it's more of a pain than I'd like, even though they are super comfortable overall. The lack of pockets is a big deal for me because obviously, I keep my phone with me most of the time, so not being able to do that is a real bummer. So pros and cons...but overall still super stretchy and a great style.",

These are great for working out or just casual lounge pants. I have a hard time finding pants that are long enough for my legs, I'm 5'9"", but these are perfect in length. The size feels accurate to me. These are a tighter style than some yoga pants but I prefer the compression feel over loose ones that bunch up every time you move. I think they look great on as well. Great pants overall and thrilled to have something besides black!",

The high-waist design is super flattering and gives great support, making them perfect for both casual wear and workouts. The stretch material is incredibly comfortable, allowing for easy movement whether I’m doing yoga or just running errands.  One of the best features is the fold-over ruched waistband. It adds a stylish touch and allows you to adjust the fit, so it always feels just right. The flare at the bottom is just the right amount, giving a trendy look without being too much.  I’ve worn these pants for yoga sessions, casual outings, and even for lounging at home, and they’ve been fantastic in every situation. They wash well too, maintaining their shape and color after multiple washes. Overall, these leggings are a versatile addition to any wardrobe, and I highly recommend them!",

I had ordered my usual size (XL) after checking the size information in the product description. When I pulled the pants from the package, I was surprised how small the waist and hips were. I thought at first that I had received the wrong size, but they are marked XL. I struggled to get the yoga pants on. Although there is some stretch, it didn't overcome the tightness I felt at my waist, hips and thighs. I couldn't wait to take off these pants. The fabric is much thicker than what I've experienced with other yoga pants. I do, however, like the style with the flared legs and fold-over ruched waistband. These pants simply didn't work out very well for me.",2

It does have the 4-way stretch but it gets quite tight in the thigh area. I'm used to yoga pants that have a lot of stretch! That being said it is most definitely not see-through, even when stretched to it's max. The fold over waist doesn't curl down or up. Because of the thickness and tightness of the fabric it does offer some ""tummy control"", not a lot but I'll take what I can get! Seem to be well made & will be nice when it's colder outside.",2
