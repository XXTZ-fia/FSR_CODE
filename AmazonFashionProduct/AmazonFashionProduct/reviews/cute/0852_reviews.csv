It fits so freaking well.  I’ve been hitting the gym and so this hugs my body so well. I went with the large.  The shorts had me worried at first since it only gives me about an inch worth of coverage right beneath my butt cheek. I wore it for a casual night out with friends and it held up to this horrible heat wave. It’s 86 degrees even in the middle of the night.  The shorts were not riding up at all and despite the middle seam on the shorts, zero camel toe.  It does show cellulite in the lighter colors so I would recommend you choose a darker color like black or grey to make it less noticeable.  The fabric is medium weight, elastic and breathable.  I paired mine with sneakers and a really cute purse. Accessories and how you pair it can really change how it looks.  At first you will feel odd as I felt it’s more suited for indoor use but I got so many compliments from my friends. That’s how I ended up with so many colors lol  Will soon wear the baby pink set with sneakers for an outdoor BBQ.  Just FYI, I’m wearing the blue set in this picture.",32
