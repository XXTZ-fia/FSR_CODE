They loves the cats and says it's comfortable, I can't get them to take it off. However, it's very thin. The name says ""sweatshirt"" then it says ""T-shirt"", this is more like a thin T-shirt material, not a sweatshirt at all, thinner than even a regular long sleeved shirt imo. So its great for mild weather, but definitely not something I would wear if you want them to stay warm.",
