Bought this turtleneck in every color.  Bought as a layering option to wear under sweaters in the cold weather.  Went with medium based on reviews but definitely could have worn a small.  I generally like base layers to be fitted and this is comfortably loose, but not too large to work under sweaters. I could also easily wear it by itself.  The neck isn't tight, which is important bc I can't stand anything tight against my neck. I wear it folded down and it is a perfect height on my neck.  I wouldn't consider this a true thermal base layer, but it is a nice medium thickness, soft and stretchy and does add some warmth.  I highly recommend",

It was supposed to arrive three days before I left for my trip but it arrived two days after I left. I was not happy however that has nothing to do with the quality of this product. I couldn’t believe for the money how thick it was at how soft and how comfortable it was it washed beautifully. It would’ve been the perfect shirt to help. Keep me warm up north when nothing else could. I bought a size small and it fits perfectly. Highly recommend,2

I went with the cream color for versatility and it goes well with a lot of outfits. I washed it and dried it to try to shrink the neck but it didn’t make much of a difference. There are probably better turtlenecks out there to be honest.,
