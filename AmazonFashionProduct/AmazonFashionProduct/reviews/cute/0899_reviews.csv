It came in a vacuum sealed package so upon opening it, the vest was very wrinkled and thin feeling. I let it sit out and open hoping that may e some of the ""puffiness"" would essentially come back as the Pictures shows but unfortunately it hasn't. The picture makes it look like it's a thicker vest but it is not. It is thin. The picture does reflect like the imperfect type wrinkles but the way this came it is very wrinkled looking and does not resemble the picture at all. I'm not sure if this material can be steamed to get some out or not. I purchased a medium. Looks true to size. However it does look to be more of a semi crop vest in the picture but the actual vest seems to be between belly button and waist length so a little longer than the average crop style lengths.

It’s durable and easy to wash.  However, I found that the sizing runs large. I ordered an extra small, but it still feels too big for me. If you're considering this vest, I recommend sizing down for a better fit. Despite the sizing issue, it's a stylish and practical addition to my winter wardrobe. Overall, a solid choice for anyone looking for a warm and comfortable vest.",4
