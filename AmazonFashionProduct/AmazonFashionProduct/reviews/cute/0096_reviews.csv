I tried it on her to just see how it looked, and it's so adorable -- I am dying for the fall seasons to get here so she can wear it. It isn't too massive on her and just the little bit she'll grow in the next month will be perfect to fill the outfit out!  The bottoms have the feel of the infamous buttery soft leggings people talk about, and I think they'll be such a comfortable pair for her to wear!  This washes nicely with no issues and we washed it on a normal load with other baby clothes.",
