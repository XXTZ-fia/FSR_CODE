Erin,Cute but...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RZQO7S1R1DS9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DC9S65HS,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: Tie Dye-aSize: 5-6T,,"So I definitely think this outfit is super cute and my 4 year old loved the design as well. However, the material is just flat out awful. I hate this new fad of fast fashion cheap non breathable knock off silky fabric that's being used on everything now. My daughter almost immediately wants to take this outfit off due to the suffocating feeling it creates. The material is not breathable in the slightest and the kind of silky feel causes all of the body heat to get trapped inside the outfit and you almost instantly start to sweat. How do I know this? Because I have been trying on clothes from places like amazon for a while now hoping to find a cheaper alternative to clothes but I have been so disappointed in quality of all of these trending fabrics. Back to shopping at tj maxx I go because this is not it. I have found many outfits made from this same type material and I immediately start to have hot flashes the second I put it on. That's the same issue my child had with this outfit and several others bought from amazon as well. So my advice...steer clear of the fast fashion fabrics pouring into amazon and if you're on a budget ross is just as cheap and way better quality. Don't buy this crap.",

Unfortunately, this is not it. Yes, it's long sleeves/pants and has a hood, but the material is super thin. It's NOT sweatpants and a sweatshirt, as the title suggests!! It's not even the soft buttery material I've come to expect from something being marketed as ""joggers."" It feels closer to loose exercise wear.  Nonetheless, my daughter LOVES the colors and design, and she thinks it's so cool that the shirt and pants match. So it's a decent find in the style regard, but if you're looking for warm, look elsewhere.",2
