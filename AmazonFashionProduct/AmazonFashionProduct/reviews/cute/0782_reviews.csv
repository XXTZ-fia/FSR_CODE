I went to try it on and realized the crotch area (where the buttons snap) was stiff and crusty….come to realize this one piece has obviously been worn. It looks like bodily fluids have been left there. Absolutely disgusting. I understand people make returns and its sometimes hard to tell if the product has been used but this is crazy and extremely unclean,

Fabulous!,Good Quality - But Less Easy to Style Than You'd Think,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNSKV6FO34WWN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSK8MXZ7,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Size: MediumColor: White,,"The bodysuit is super durable, stretchy, and comfortable. It doesn't shift when wearing. Its inner material has a silky soft quality that feels great against your skin. The clasps at the bottom stay done until you manually pull them apart.  The material is that of those shiny, athletic leggings - which gives it great stretch and all-season comfort. But it also gives it a shininess and slickness that makes it more difficult to visually style with other cotton or soft materials.  Additionally, I do not agree with previous reviews I've read about its functionality without a bra. Because of the neckline, you cannot wear a full cup bra without it peeking out. Maybe a plunging balconette would do. You, also, cannot reliably wear it without a bra or with nipple covers - as the bodysuit adheres so closely to your body that both will show (the former really only shows if you are cold).  Overall, its good. I've worn it a few times regardless of the issues I've pointed out - but more as a layer than a top itself. I was comfortable the whole night. However, don't believe the reviews that say its the holy grail of all bodysuits.",
