Hailey May,Double lined skims dupe!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12393RRU9GB66/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPF4N221,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Blush,Verified Purchase,I love this top! It squeezes you in all the right places and the color is perfect for spring and summer. My favorite thing about this top is that it's double lined as well!

Not completely buttery soft, but does have a somewhat cooling feeling & is double lined which I feel makes it look a lil better quality. I felt they were what I would expect, honestly, but maybe others would think higher of them. I am 135lbs, 5’7, and 34DD- I have ordered Medium and Large. I have a few different colors. I noticed the Medium seems to stretch a little in the chest/armpit area as if too snug with my chest size whereas the Large (in white) seemed to be less form fitting/looser & less flattering. Out of the two sizes, I think I would choose the Medium again because the Large just seemed to not fit the way it should. The Medium does rise in the belly area though too from being form fitting so I believe it is all preference.",

I was curious to see if I could get similar quality for a fraction of the price. The shirt fits perfectly! It’s true to size and has a great stretch to it, which makes it feel like it hugs my body in all the right places. It’s not too tight but still gives a smooth, flattering shape. The material is soft and feels high-quality—definitely not cheap or flimsy. It’s smooth to the touch, and while it's not as luxe as the real Skims fabric, it’s pretty close. It holds its shape well after washing, too. The shirt is incredibly comfortable. It’s breathable and stretchy, which makes it perfect for wearing all day. I’ve worn it to work and out running errands, and it never feels too tight or uncomfortable. I’ve washed the shirt several times, and it’s held up really well. It hasn’t shrunk, faded, or lost its shape, which I was worried about since it’s a dupe. I just hang it to dry, and it’s as good as new. Overall, I’m really impressed with this Skims shirt dupe. It offers similar quality and fit for a fraction of the price, and I’ll definitely be buying more. If you’re looking for an affordable alternative to Skims, I highly recommend giving this one a try!",

The material is substantial and thick, contour style so it’s definitely snug, which is what I wanted as I wear them with trouser style or looser pants. The “Pearl” color is definitely not a white, it’s off white more of a cream for sure which I didn’t expect. At first I thought I’d send it back but when I tried it on it does look lovely. Size wise I think it’s true to size. I am 34C- 25 waist and normally a XS/Small and the Small was perfect for me. The waist has a little extra material but if I went smaller the chest would be too tight. It’s definitely meant to be a snug top , but the material is smoothing.
