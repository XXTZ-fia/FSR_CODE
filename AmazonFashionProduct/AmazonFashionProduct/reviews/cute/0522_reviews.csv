Here’s why I love it:  Chic Lace Detail: The lace accents on the neckline and sleeves add such an elegant touch. It’s feminine and classy without being over the top. Soft and Comfortable: The fabric is soft and breathable, making it comfortable to wear all day long. It has just the right amount of stretch for a flattering fit. Business Casual Perfection: This blouse is ideal for the office, paired with slacks or a skirt. But it’s just as great for casual outings with jeans or leggings. True to Size: The fit was exactly as expected based on the size chart, and it’s neither too tight nor too loose—just right! Easy to Care For: It’s held up beautifully after washing, with no shrinking or fading.",3

I just love the puff sleeves and they have this design that's just wonderful on the sleeves, and you can see your skin through this because of the crochet. The colors are very nice, but not vibrant. The shirts are nice and affordable that I purchased several of them in several different colors. I just love these shirts, the V-neck is very flattering. The fit is true. The material of these shirts is nice it's not super soft, however, but it is comfortable and not scratchy. The sleeves are like a crochet and it's very flattering. I would say it's a go. Even though these shirts are not super warm for the winter, they are awesome when you don't want a very warm long sleeve shirt. They are a cool long sleeve shirt if there's such a thing. Like and let me know if you found this review helpful. Have a great shopping day.",32
