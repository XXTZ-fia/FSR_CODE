Jennifer S.,Really wanted to love this,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VP0JRDYK5A6Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CFBBQL2Q,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Coffeegrey,Verified Purchase,"So I first bought their sweatshirt/sweatpants set in light grey in size large. Love the sweatshirt, fits great, but the pants were super tight, felt like a size small. I decided to buy this coffee color sweatshirt only, size large, and it fits like a 1x, swimming in it even after wash/dry. Love the color and style but so very disappointed it didn't fit the same as the other large I bought, same brand! I really wanted to love this but it just makes me look so much bigger than I really am. What's up with the extreme size difference?",

I will say that when I took it off, there was a lot of fluff transfer on my black t shirt, that’s the only issue but I guess it’s new so that’s normal.",

I'm guessing it's priced at what it is because the style is more so a dupe for name brand similar item that is expensive and popular... I might buy more colors, not sure yet. I am going to wait and see if it shrinks much after washing. I'd say size up if you want it to be a more oversize look.",
