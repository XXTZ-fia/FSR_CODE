I like the color, and they have several to choose from. The fabric is soft and it seems made well enough. For me, it hits a little too high on the neckline. I am not looking for something super low cut at all, but I have other tanks that are just a tad lower (more like the photo in their listing) that I like better. I think that the slightly lower cut looks better on me because I am short and top heavy. I will be returning this one because there are other brands that I like better, but if you prefer a more modest tank, this may be the one for you!",2
