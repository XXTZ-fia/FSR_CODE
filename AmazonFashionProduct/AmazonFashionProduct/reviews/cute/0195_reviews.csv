Cancer causing toxins are sitting on your most vulnerable parts and we wonder why breast cancer and other reproductive related cancers are rampant? Really. Do better for your daughters and stop promoting things that will do our daughter bodily harm, that is pushing these products for profits. Its no better than the mainstream companies that do it.

I’m also small chested & the top is very fitted for me. I will also say the ribbed texture looks nice but after wearing it for a day, I find it makes me itchy. If you don’t have this issue with other ribbed, fitted fabrics then it may not be an issue for you. In short, I’d keep this as a priced piece and likely buy more if they wouldn’t have torn after light use. Disappointed for sure!",2
