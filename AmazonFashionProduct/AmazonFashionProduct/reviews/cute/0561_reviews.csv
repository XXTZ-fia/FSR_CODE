The fit is snug, but forgiving around the middle because, at least on someone shorter, they kind of scrunch.  I am 5'4"" 150 lbs and order the large.  Even at 60 years old, the fit of these is flattering and makes me feel youthful.  I don't dry mine in the dryer, but I think they would probably be fine.  The red and black are very vivid and the white is truly white.  The khaki isn't quite like pictured but is still a versatile option.  I recommend!",
