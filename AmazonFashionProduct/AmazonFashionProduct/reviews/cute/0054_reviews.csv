The stitching and fabric are all very fine and I am very pleased with everything except the color of the overall outfit. It looks a little dingy, in my opinion. If I had it to do over, I would choose a different color because this color looks like I accidentally washed a white outfit with my colors and it got faded. It just isn't very pretty. It's the only reason I took off one star. It doesn't look the same in person as it looks in the advertisement.",
