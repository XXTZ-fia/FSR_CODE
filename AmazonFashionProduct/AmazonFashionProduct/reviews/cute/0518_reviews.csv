The pockets hold my oversized phone + bulky case with no problem. The arm holes are high enough to cover your bra but not high enough to irritate your armpits. The mock neck doesn't choke you whatsoever. This jumpsuit made me feel good about my body for the first time in a long time, that's how flattering it is.  My only complaint is how short the zipper is. While you can get in and out of it just fine, trying to reach back and zip it is a bit of a pain, especially when you're in a rush.
