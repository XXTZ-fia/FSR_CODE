My grandson looks more and more like a little boy instead of a baby/toddler every day and this outfit takes that one step farther.  The clothes are well made and of a good weight for late fall and early winter. If you put a T-shirt on underneath the top, this would easily work in full-blown winter too, I think. The styling is great, with the quarter-zip, the texture, and the patch on the front.  Regarding sizing, I think these are pretty true to size. My grandson is 15 months old and these are a little big for him. He's a little big for his age (he's 33"" tall and weighs about 25 pounds), so I think when he's a month or two older, these are going to fit perfectly.  Really pleased with this outfit!",
