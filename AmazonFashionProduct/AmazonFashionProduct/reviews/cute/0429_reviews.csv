It has three distinct fabrics: the waffle weave, stretchy slightly sheer panels down both sides, and a smooth material around the collar and cuffs and down the placket.  The apricot color is a rich cream.  I didn't love the buttons and replaced them, reversing the ones on the cuffs so I could fold the cuffs back and still button them.  Another reviewer mentioned carefully removing the pockets.  I've taken one off and am considering whether to remove the second one for a slightly less rugged look.  I like this shacket so much I also got a black one, which came with slightly nicer buttons and which I don't intend to modify.  And honestly, now I have my eye on a possible third one.  This waffle weight is perfect for cooler winter days in Florida.  I'm 5'4', 135 lbs, like my clothes roomy and am happy with size L.  I haven't washed either shacket yet: I always use a washbag, cold water, and hang garments like this to dry, so I'm hoping shrinkage will be minimal.  If not, I will revise my review.",7
