I’m a chesty girl so I didn’t know if this would be one of those things that makes me look pregnant, but it really doesn’t, it’s just flattering, especially on the legs.  The ties on the side to make the sides pull up are my favorite part. I’m going on a cruise and got this to have a bit more sun protection while still wearing something lightweight and this definitely checks those boxes. I usually stick with sleeveless cover ups but I’m glad I gave this one a try. If you’re on the fence, I say go for it!",

The gorgeous purple color immediately caught my eye, and it’s even more stunning in person. It’s the kind of color that’s vibrant yet elegant—perfect for summer days by the water.  Fit and Comfort: I’m 5’3” and 140 pounds, and I ordered a size large. It fits exactly how I hoped—loose but not baggy, with the hem hitting about an inch above my knee. I really appreciate the length because it feels more like a casual dress than a typical short cover-up, which is exactly what I wanted.  Design and Features: • The sleeves are a great feature! You can roll them up for a relaxed look or leave them down for a bit more coverage. • The drawstrings on each side are genius—they let you adjust the length depending on your mood or activity. • It’s incredibly comfortable to wear, even in the heat. The material feels soft and breathable, making it perfect for throwing on over a swimsuit.  What I Love: • The purple color! I can’t say enough about how beautiful it is—it’s truly my favorite part of this cover-up. • The versatility: It’s stylish enough to wear beyond the beach. It can even be paired with sandals for a quick lunch by the shore. • The fit: It’s flattering without being too tight, and the adjustable drawstrings let me customize the look.  This cover-up is everything I wanted and more. It’s beautiful, comfortable, and functional—perfect for the beach, poolside, or casual summer outings. If you’re looking for a cover-up that feels more like a chic dress, I highly recommend this one. And if you love purple as much as I do, this is a must-have! I will definitely be taking it on my cruise!",

I tried this one over a bikini to see how it’d fit realistically…. It felt kinda soft- if I was sweaty or hot it’d probs feel better but nonetheless— It TORE/ripped right at the cleavage just on TRY ON haha. So embarrassing… now it looks like I’m too big for it even though the rest of the cover up fits really well!
