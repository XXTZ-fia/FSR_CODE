I’ve tried lint rolling (pictured above) & it won’t stop, it ruined 2 light colored pieces of clothing that was in the wash with this, & it coated our dryer in the black coating of fuzzies. & when I wear it, I breathe in the fuzzies & black fuzzies coat my nostrils, & my whatever shirt I wear underneath this gets the coating of black fuzzies also, along with my daughters clothing when I hold her.
