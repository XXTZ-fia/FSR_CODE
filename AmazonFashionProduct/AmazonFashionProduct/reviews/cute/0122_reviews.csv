Calie C,Love these leggings!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LS0AI6XK08AE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5MTZNSR,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 28, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I really love these leggings! The fit true to size, have lots of stretch, and the material over the belly does not roll or fall down like many other brands. Material is very soft. My only complaint is the crotch is a bit loose and these aren't as thick as many yoga/workout leggings. I do prefer ones that are a bit thicker with more spandex type material for a bit more compression, but the comfort of these definitely outweighs that complaint.",

Chrissy,"Excellent legging, way better than more expensive ones from other maternity-specific brands",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRDFJQIU4P70U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5MTZNSR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"These are nice, lightweight, buttery soft maternity leggings.  Very similar in feel to the align leggings from lululemon.  Fits really well other the bump.  I'm about 32 weeks pregnant, 5'6"" hovering around 170 lbs and the medium fits great.  Pre-pregnancy weight was around 140-145 and my usual size was medium.  I believe there is still plenty of room in these to continue to stretch through the end of the pregnancy.  Other leggings I've tried are too constricting at the top of the belly and at the ankles and are not stretchy enough and cut in causing discomfort.  These leggings do not have that problem.  They are comfortable to wear all day long, and there are no seams that cut into the legs.  I wish I would have bought these earlier in the pregnancy and before I purchased two other pairs from other maternity-specific brands.  Only note is they are not very warm if you are looking for something to wear out in the winter.  However, they are amazing and breathable when you get to someone who keeps their house at 74 degrees...  Highly recommend -- will likely by another pair.",

They are smooth like butter, hug to my body nicely, comfortable over the belly, don’t slide down or stretch out after wearing, not see-through, and they stretch with the swelling in your legs so they always fit and are never too tight. I have cotton leggings that I can’t wear due to my increase of swelling in my legs, so these have been my number 1 go too as they don’t suffocate my ankles.  Highly suggest them. I promise you will love them! Worth every penny.",
Amanda Smith,Feel great - order pre pregnancy size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMK9E37CDMK01/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5MTZNSR,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Butter is a good description, these are very soft, comparable to my lululemon aligns but these have far more stretch to them. I sweat horrifically pregnant and postpartum and these have held up and dried fairly quickly. I live in Savannah, GA where it’s hot and humid and I don’t feel warm in them and I don’t feel squeezed or constricted in the mediums but they still stay in place pretty good, but I just fidget in general this far along so I kinda wiggle them up. I will say the medium is a bit big, gapping at times across my pelvis but still work. If you like a bit bigger or not compressive fit, I’d order a size up from your pre pregnancy size for late pregnancy (I am 35weeks and been wearing these for 2-3 weeks practically every day). Since I’m wearing them so much (I do still go to the gym almost every day) I ordered them again in a small to see if they wouldn’t gap or I could get another days wear without them stretching a bit. The smalls are my size. I haven’t worn them to the gym but they are a tiny bit compressive (remember this material is stretchy) and they don’t gap across my pelvis. A small is my pre pregnancy size. Oh, also you can easily fold the top down so it’s under the bump, kinda supportive vs over the bump. I generally like u see the bump wear but wanted over the bump so I could wear regular shorts to the gym without showing skin.  For reference I am 5’5” with an athletic build. I’m a bit boxy with long legs and a short torso. pre pregnancy I am somewhere between 134-144lbs (this is my second so I’m a bit bigger and I didn’t get a good steady weight after my first born who is 19m). I’m generally a size 4-6 but prefer bottoms that don’t squeeze too much so I can opt for 8s at times. Currently I am 35 weeks pregnant and 168-170lbs.",11

Sj,Amazing maternity leggings.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF1E7C5Z09E1F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5MTZNSR,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 20, 2024",Size: MediumColor: True Navy,Verified Purchase,"I bought these leggings around 9 weeks pregnant. I have photos in this review from 9 weeks, 20 weeks and now 23 weeks. So far these are my go to legging. I have 5 pairs of them, all in black. In the first trimester I folded the top part down and they acted like normal leggings with just a little more room for my slightly bigger belly. Now in the second trimester they work great with the full belly coverage. They remain up for the majority of the day, if I’m really running and moving around they slightly slide down but nothing that would warrant not buying them. The seams are sewn really well and I have had no problems with washing or drying many times. The thickness is enough where they are not see through but they are not winter thick. These leggings do not have pockets but this brand sells ones with pockets if you want those. Overall I wish I had these for my first pregnancy, but now that I have them I’m very happy with them (that’s why I bought 5 pairs) it’s totally worth the money. I bought size medium and I am pre pregnancy weight 150 and currently 158 at 23 weeks.",6
Taylor Getz,So soft and comfortable!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R30PXI3C9XFV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5MTZNSR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,I'm only 13 weeks so not in need yet of maternity leggings but these had great reviews and were on sale so I grabbed a pair. These are FANTASTIC! So comfortable for an everyday/lounge legging while pregnant - I haven't worked out with them but they are not compressive at all so probably only good for walking. They are light and buttery soft and fit well - I'd say if anything they run a little big but not to the point that you need to size down. Going to grab another pair or two!,

I ordered a medium initially (usually wear a 6 in lulu), & they just weren’t as compressive (not that I want the belly squeezed!) as I wanted them to be, ended up getting an XXS and they are great.  I’m 5’3” and they are maybe an inch longer than I want, but I just roll the very end up an inch, & they are perfect. Squat proof. Comfortable.  I’ve had these for a few months now, and have noticed some pilling on the inner thigh portion.  The color selection is awesome.",

I have purchased from this brand before and really like the quality. HOWEVER… I am only 5’2” and these are almost cropped on me. I’m a little shocked by how short they are. It’s like 2 to 3 inches above my ankle. They also fall down a lot, but maybe I need to go down a smaller size. I am 155 lbs and carry most of my weight in my hips and thighs so I ordered a large, but I think I should’ve done a medium.  I haven’t ordered original leggings from them for a while, but these feel thinner than the non-pregnancy leggings I have from them so I’m not sure if it’s just the style or if they are making all of their leggings like this now. They also don’t have a whole lot of compression, but maybe that’s again just because i got a bigger size. For example, the bottom of the leg, is loose and gaps, its not tight on my calf like a regular legging should be.",

They keep slipping down, and I find myself pulling them up a lot throughout the day. If your thighs rub together like mine, I’ve also noticed that they start pilling between the legs pretty fast.  My last note is that the maternity waist band is pretty high; if you have a short torso, these might not fit you very well outside of your third trimester.  I would still recommend looking for a higher quality pair of maternity leggings with better fit, material, and a little more support, but like I said at the beginning, they’re cheap enough and comfortable enough to add a pair or two to the rotation.",2

sierra ramage,BEST maternity leggings ever,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E8NMCMHLKFBC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5MTZNSR,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 30, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"If you’re like me & scouring the reviews hoping to decide which brand of maternity leggings are worth spending money on… please trust me, these are it. I’ve tried SO many (like, I think 9 brands now?) & these win. They’re comfortable, soft, opaque, have a nice high rise band that comes up to my bra line, & they stretch. I have been wearing these on repeat even though I have so many others, because these are the most comfy (almost 3rd trimester now). The seam isn’t on my belly, which I love most. About to order another pair even though I only have a few months left. 10/10",6
