Lila,"Casual V neck top for fall is decent quality, fits as expected, but fabric is a bit thin",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28ML5UJAISCBA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6GCJFPL,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 18, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: 03 White,,"I got this white casual V neck top to wear for fall. I ordered an XXL, which is my usual size, and it fits as expected. The top looks decent on me. My only issue with the fabric is that it's a bit thin, so you can see pretty clearly what I'm wearing underneath. It's not a huge issue, since I'll probably be wearing layers in the fall, but definitely worth pointing out if you're ordering the white like I did. Also, the thinness of the fabric makes it feel a bit cheap. It's well-stitched, but I'm not sure how long it will last in general. I guess for $19.99 (the price at the time of this review) it's hard to expect something that would last a very long time. Overall, I'd recommend this shirt.",2

I have washed it a couple of times and it has fared well.I wear long sleeve tops at work during the summer as the air-conditioning freezes me to the bone.

It does have long sleeves, but I know that because it is lightweight, I can definitely wear this on cooler nights. It’s gorgeous and I LOVE the “yellow” color. It’s more of a mustard color to me, which is one of my favorite fabric colors.  One feature that really got my attention is that the seam looks like it is halfway through the middle of the shirt, front and back. It gives it a super cool look. And then you have the scooped neckline that is very appealing. And when you follow the sizing guidelines, this shirt should, and does, fit you loosely. I am so excited about this because so many of my shirts are tighter fitting. This T-shirt is loose fitting, and so, so comfortable. Probably because the fabric consists of 65% polyester, and 35% cotton. This shirt should be comfortable for even those who can’t find super comfortable, soft shirts. This is the one.  I love the style, the color, the fabric display that accentuates your best body features, the price is super great, and most of all this T-shirt is so comfortable!",4
Taterlayne,"Light and breezy, runs small",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUQNB3URC3UCV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6GCJFPL,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 30, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: 03 White,,"I really like the material of this top. It is similar to a t-shirt, but it is even lighter with small patches of extra light fabric heathered in. The external stitching adds a casual and relaxed style, and the loose v-neck is flattering. The baggy design is extra comfortable and can even be used for loungewear or sleeping. I like that the thinner material lets you wear it for longer in the year, especially in a warmer climate like mine, where long sleeves only get a few months of wear. It comes in several dusty shades that enhance the casual vibe. It runs small, however, in the arms and chest based on their sizing chart. I still like the shirt and will try to stretch it out and still wear it because I like it so much despite this.",2
