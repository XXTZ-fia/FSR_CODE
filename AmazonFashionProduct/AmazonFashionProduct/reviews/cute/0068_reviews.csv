Rick Gray,Cute and versatile,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUBY1CUOJPG3F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNC5ZLVR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"This cardigan / top is very cute and versatile. The fabric is soft and super comfortable to wear. In person, the cardigan looks just like the photos. I love that this cardigan can be worn as a shirt as well! It is easy to dress up or down whether you're wearing it to work, dinner, a social event, or just to run errands. The buttons are well attached and the sewing is well done. The cardigan even washed well in the washing machine. I would say the cardigan fits true to size so if you are wanting an oversized cardigan you might want to size up. Overall, this cardigan is super cute, comfortable, and versatile!",

Donna Smith,"Beautiful clear bright pink, relaxed fit comfortable cardigan",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RRMJ4WZ0LSU5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNC5ZLVR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Pink,,"I am very pleased with this cardigan sweater. The color pink is bright and vibrant, yet not flashy. The contrasting knit makes it more interesting than a regular everyday cardigan. A relaxed fit makes it comfortable and easy to wear over clothing. However, if you are between sizes, it may be too ""relaxed"" if you choose to size up. I am eager to wear this; it looks like spring, but wearing it now, in the winter, will just brighten my day.",

It fits perfectly true to size. It's warm, but light enough to wear comfortably in a heated indoor situation, or into the springtime, too. It's the perfect length that it covers a bit if belly, but not soo long that it causes proportions to seem off. And it will go perfectly with jeans, or I like wearing it with a long skirt to dress it up for church or date night.",

The material is very nice and soft, nice color-matched buttons, and the pattern of the knit makes for a nice combination of a see thorough upper band and a full knit middle and bottom. I did not get to wash it yet, but expect no surprises by the composition of the yarn. Well made, no issues at all on the one I got.",
FN,"Versatile, but loose fitting",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OXRKWKTK3KZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNC5ZLVR,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Size: SmallColor: White,,"This sweater is really cute for summer wear.  It has a nice weight and thickness and would also work well in the fall.  It is very soft & really comfortable when on.  I do love the short sleeves and the ribbing.  The button holes are not loose which I truly love.  I wear a small which is what I ordered in the white.  The fit is a bit looser than I prefer, especially for being small.  The sweater is boxy with very little structure.  The white is a great color on this sweater, can’t beat it in the summertime.  I can see wearing this with a tank or by itself.  Nice sweater for dressing up or down it does have versatility.  Nice bargain too!",
William H. Suters,Attractive Sweater,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UEPOXVAVKF2E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNC5ZLVR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Green,,I am very pleased with this sweater. I chose the olive green in a large which is a bit bigger than my normal size but I like the option of having it bigger to wear as a layer over a dress or shirt and it looks nice open or closed in layers. I also like just wearing the sweater solo as it's not too baggy and has a nice shape to it. It has a good texture and has attractive stitching and I feel that it will hold up nicely over time. Excellent choice and quality for purchase.,
Nel,Medium Weight Yarn,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21VUUVOXDCYUH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNC5ZLVR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Green,,I'd call this a medium weight sweater. The yarn is knitted in a slightly loose weave making the sweater a lighter weight. The green color is reminiscent of the needles of coniferous trees. The garment is true to size and well constructed without loose buttons or threads. This is a nice layer for warmer weather and a good value.,
Amy G,"Good quality knit, matches the pictures",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34WFDXY3EFY6M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNC5ZLVR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Pink,,"For a short sleeve sweater, this is thicker than I expected. On it's own, it will be nice in the warmer months, but it can also be worn over a long sleeve shirt in colder weather. I ordered the pink and it matches the photos quite well. The knit is fairly soft and nicely woven without any flaws or snags. The buttons are securely sewn and fit the holes well. The fit seems true to size, maybe even slightly loose. I really like this sweater and am looking forward to pairing it with several tops underneath. This would be suitable for work and casual wear, and is best suited for grown women. I'm not sure trendy types or teens would be into this rather classic style. It's a very nice garment that I highly recommend.",

There have only been a few items that I haven't loved.....even things that didn't look good on me were still very cute and excellent quality.  Overall, I think Dokotoo understands a plus size woman's body and delivers consistently flattering plus size clothing.  This sweater is the perfect color of green, and fits perfectly.",

Debbie Schroeder,Really soft,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1W886EZSNWGNK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNC5ZLVR,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 30, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Pink,,"This is a nice weight--not too thin, but not too heavy. I think it's OK to wear by itself, but I wouldn't want it any more see-through. It is really soft, unlike so many sweaters these days. I got the pink one. Recently any pinks I order are not compatible with other pink prints and layering pieces that I already have. The recent colors are more peachy. While not a ""Barbie pink,"" this one comes closest in what has been available recently (but still with a hue towards peach).",
Adrienne E,Love the color!

It has a flattering shape that provides coverage without being boxy, and I appreciate how comfortable it is to wear in Florida during December. The sweater is well-made, fits true to size, and works great whether I wear it open or closed with a cami underneath. I’m a fan of acrylic material, so I’m especially pleased with how soft and lightweight it feels. Plus, it washes well, making it easy to care for.",
Curious,Very comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AXTBWVFTL20A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNC5ZLVR,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Green,,"This cardigan is very comfortable and designed well. It hits me on the hip in a place that doesn't make me look bigger, and it also has a little bit of shape to it so you can see that I have a waist as well. The shoulders are about an inch too wide on both sides though. I'm not fond of the drop shoulder look in general. On me it just makes the garment look ill fitting and I personally look sloppily dressed, but I plan to have it altered because I really like the sweater otherwise.",

Mine did have a few small stitching errors but nothing that detracts from the look.  I got the pink and it is a soft pink with a hint of peach. I live in a warm climate and this is great for a pretty cover up to go in an air conditioned building or wear on a cooler day. It is soft and feminine.,

I normally wear a size x-large and he ordered it in large but it fits comfortably. I’m able to button it up just fine. The material is soft and it didn’t have any strange smells when it came. I wore it over the top of a turtleneck with yoga pants and it looked nice.,
