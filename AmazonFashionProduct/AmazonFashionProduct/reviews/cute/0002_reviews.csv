Keeps me very, very warm during the insanely windy & cold winters in the desert.  Be advised this sweatsuit is an oversized style. I am typically between a size small & medium, and the dark green in a size medium is a little big too oversized for the look I wanted. I would say the sweatpants are a bit more oversized than the top (not by very much & the difference isn’t noticeable appearance-wise). When I wear this sweatsuit I’m definitely warm & comfy, and it looks like I borrowed this from my boyfriend which is totally cool with me.  Yes, the pricing is a bit steep, however it’s a sweatsuit that lasts and absolutely does what it’s supposed to. My roommate ordered a dark green sweatsuit from a competitor on Amazon that was half the price, however upon arrival she was super disappointed- the competitor sweatsuits are shiny & too polyester-looking with terrible quality elastic.  This is a great buy. I highly recommend it.",3

The most frustrating thing is about the sweatshirt, the hood is SO heavy that it constantly pulls the sweatshirt back and the neckline is being pulled against my neck. It makes it SO uncomfortable and claustrophobic. The neck hole is rather large, which I prefer, but having to pull the sweatshirt down in front every three seconds just so I wasn’t feeling like I was being choked was irritating. The pants are okay, but they’re disproportionate to the top. The sweatshirt fits as expected, an oversized medium fit. The pants that come with it, also a size medium, look and fit like an XL. They’re way too baggy and shapeless and much larger than the size of the sweatshirt they’re supposed to coordinate with. The drawstring is also on the inside and it’s SO long. Seriously, it almost goes down to my knees if it isn’t tied, and when it is tied because there’s so much length it’s uncomfortable sitting on the inside of the waistband. Save your money, look elsewhere. Wish I could return but I had to take the actual fabric tags off to even wear because they were incredibly scratchy.",

I first purchased the light blue in medium. After the first wash in cold water and dried on low heat, it shrunk. I then ordered the light green one in large, considering the fact that they shrunk. The light green fit perfectly after the same first wash, and still does. I ordered the pink one in large, considering my good experience with the large green, and expecting the same fit. The pink one showed up and the waistband at the bottom of the hoodie was completely outstretched and not fitted tightly like all hoodies, it was not the same product as the green one. It doesn’t seem like they are all made the same. & Considering they are charging $60+ for these, I really expected a more consistent product.

I love oversized sweats, but these pants puff out a lot at the bottom around the calves and ankles. The hood is HUGE, and the thickest material I've ever seen on a hood. It's double/triple lined and is even thicker than the sweatshirt material. It literally weighs the sweatshirt down towards the back, and it pokes out from behind and there's no way to flatten it lol. For sizing reference i got a medium, I'm 5'6 and 137 pounds, with long legs so most pants are short on me.

I ordered these for my two teen girls and I. I am 5’ 10” and 150lbs with long arms and legs. My girls are similar in size. I have bought several size Large and they do work, but I would like a little extra length in the arms and legs for personal preference. I decided to order an Xl In the dark green. It arrived and I did like the fit on me a bit more due to a tad extra length in legs and arms. Disappointingly, there appeared to be some crusty food type stains on the hood. I tried using water and a clean washcloth to wipe off, but once the crusties came off it had a grease stain. The box and packing was not damaged, so I am assuming it was from the factory. Amazon was easy to reorder a replacement. Although not a HUGE deal, it’s disappointing to pay $63 to get a crusty stained item and have to go to the hassle of driving 30 Minutes to my closest UPS store to return. 🫤",
