AM,Double check your threads,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SXVLJDI6XOKD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D12QT28N,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 7, 2024",Color: Dusty BlueSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I liked the black pair I received so I purchased a blue one. However, since the fabric was now lighter I immediately noticed all the remaining thread tails left over. Also, unfortunately, many of these stitches are not backstitched, so it's very easy for things to unravel if you pull. With extended wear, you know this is just a disaster waiting.  Of course, I checked the black pair I've owned since Oct and thread tails are indeed sticking out. Even worse, because I've been wearing these already and washed them, some of the threads have indeed already unraveled and just like the blue one - many of these threads were not backstitched UGH. The stretchy part in the back in now in danger so I'll have to sew/stitch this myself to save the pants. Not sure these pants are worth the hassle for the cost, you could get one from a reputable brand that finishes the stitches for the same price.  Also you definitely need to iron these pants once you get them because of wrinkles.",
