It is a oversize t-shirt so if you want it to fit snuggly go down two sizes.  Mine is about two sizes too big and it hangs really low.  I cannot wear it out because it is so huge but I will keep it and just wear it around the house.  This is huge t-shirt so please remember when they say oversize they mean oversize.  You could tie it up on one side and it might work. It is made well and sewn out of good fabric.  This just run really big and really oversized.  At a large this runs down past my hips. This one did not shrink hardly at all when I washed it but I did not dry it but left it to hang dry. Next time I will put it into the dryer and it probably will shrink somewhat. This shirt is well worth the price and I will order it again in the size I generally wear and not size up. Just buy your normal blouse size in this shirt.,
