Other brands/TikTok shops have these but I just wanted something more affordable (and immediate for a date this week). This brand did NOT disappoint🔥🔥 When I first opened it & held it up, it looked veryyy wide/large so I was a tad discouraged but it fit like a glove as you can see (M: I’m 150lbs & 5’5”). Also glad that it was smooth because I already own some ribbed-knit pieces.  Only con: It isn’t very thick/warm, so I’ll prob avoid wearing it for the rest of this month, but for the price it worked for a cozy/cute look with UGGs, a scarf, and ear muffs.",

This is a wonderful product. The material is thick and warm and compressing around the waist and not too tight around my legs (which are large and dense) the neckline is also compressing enough that I don’t have to wear a sports bra underneath it. The color is a rich cocoa brown and super soft. I thought it was ribbed in the photo but it’s solid but I don’t mind as the material is thick enough to blur imperfections. The butt is somewhat flattering as there is a seam that goes up the back. It takes some adjusting once you get it on but once it’s in place it is 10/10 flattering",

However, the Bodycon Jumpsuit in size small proved to be an absolute game-changer for me.  From the moment I slipped into this jumpsuit, I was blown away by its flattering fit and form-fitting silhouette. Despite not being very curvy, this jumpsuit magically created the illusion of curves in all the right places.  The quality of the material exceeded my expectations. Not only does it feel luxurious against the skin, but it also maintains its shape and structure even after multiple wears. The attention to detail, from the stitching to the construction, speaks volumes about the craftsmanship behind this piece.  One thing I love about this jumpsuit is its versatility. It can easily transition from a casual day look paired with sneakers to a chic evening ensemble with heels and statement jewelry. The timeless design ensures that it remains a staple in my wardrobe for seasons to come.  My only complaint? I want more colors! This jumpsuit has become an instant favorite, and I find myself reaching for it time and time again. Highly recommended!",15
