Em Dang,Ripped after one wash,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10ZAN5KZ9TY7W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNJBB2C3,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: Bra and Leggings: PurpleSize: Large,Verified Purchase,Material is thick and sizing is accurate but you pay for what you get. It is cute but it’s not fitted in the front so looks a bit cheap for a dupe. I wore it three times before washing and none of my other workout gear has been damaged by just washing. Luckily I know how to sew and the rip is in the back so not too noticeable but I would not recommend this product.,

I'm 5'8"", 153lbs for reference and bought a small. I always try on these sets carefully beforehand and it fit great, with good compression, stretch and comfort. The bra top for sure is only meant to be worn as loungewear or for light/slow movement such as yoga, pilates or strength training. I am a 34D and had to remove the padding as it shifted and made awkward buldges. For larger chested ladies, I don't see if the girls would be supported. I was in a strength training session focusing on legs when I realized the crotch had ripped. I was so embarrassed and rushed to the restroom to put on a long shirt that, (luckily, I had in my gymbag) that covered my backside to finish my sets. Had I bought a larger size, it would have been loose in the waistline of the leggings as well as the ribcage of the bra. I will try to sew and repair myself since it tore in the seam, but I was so bummed it happened on my first wear. I will update my review if I was able to fix it myself.",10
