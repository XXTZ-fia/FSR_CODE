The Amazon description of the top says “60% Polyester, 35% Rayon, 5% Spandex,” but the fabric tag inside the top says, “Cotton, Spandex.”  Also, the main photo of the top shows the blue top with white buttons, so I wondered why the top that was shipped to me has tan colored, wood-looking buttons. The white buttons pictured in the main photo give the blue top a nicer look.  True to size.",

I prefer a looser fit in tops, so I went XXL and I'm glad for it because it has just the right amount of room for my style. The lace sleeves and the colour held up in the wash, the fabric is super soft and comfortable.",

A definite winner for my wardrobe!!!",

The seven wooden buttons adorning the front provide options for styling: they can be worn slightly open to create a more enticing, relaxed look or fully buttoned for a classic, rounded neckline. This flexibility allows the wearer to effortlessly transition between a more casual or sophisticated appearance, depending on the occasion.  Although the color is described as Lake Blue, I would consider it more of a green, which perfectly complements my red hair. It washes well in cold water, maintaining its quality. This top is an excellent deal for its price point.",7

The stitching is decent and the buttons are all sewn on securely. I ordered the Lake Blue color, and it almost matches the photos. In person, it's more of a combination of aqua and mint green. It's a pretty color that's close enough for me. If you like your tops on the loose side, I'd order a size or two larger. I'm 5'2"" and thin and I ordered the XL.
