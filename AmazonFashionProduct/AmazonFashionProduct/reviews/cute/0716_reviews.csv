A year and a half ago I had breast reduction surgery and since then my chest has gone through many changes. It has been near impossible to find a bra that would fit me properly, and comfort is a huge factor because of my scares. I can't wear bars with wires and a lot of bars without wires, their stitching rubs on my scares. supportive sports bars, same thing and if I wear a cotton sports bar or cotton barlette.... one word, unaboob. This bar is the first bar that I have found that actually fits very nicely...because of the way my surgery was done, I get loose cup, but spilling out the side...so small cup fits my front, but not my side, and bigger cup fits my side, but is to big for my front. This bra has a very nice high side to keep everything in where it should be, and secure. but it's not to high that it's rubbing your armpits and causing discomfort. The fabric is very soft and feels really nice on your skin. It's really good at just staying in place. I slept in it over night because it was so comfortable, and when I woke up in the morning it was not rolled up under my breasts, which is super common, it happens to a lot of my sport bras with wider bands. During the day, I have not needed to play the tugging game with this bra, pulling it back down all day when it rides up. This bra is wonderful, it stays in place all day. I had purchased these bras for yoga classes, but now I will wear them ever day!!!! I am definitely ordering more of these bras!!! Highly recommended!",
