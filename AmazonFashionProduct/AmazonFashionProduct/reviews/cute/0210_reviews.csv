These fit the bill. I got the larger size. I wear a women’s size 9W shoe. The heel part is a little longer than I need but I wanted the extra room because of having wide feet. They are somewhat see through on me. This is noticeable when I wear them with black leggings with the sock over the legging. I covered that by folding the socks over so the doubled part covers the bottom of the legging which works pretty well. If you have thicker ankles/calves then the ruffle seam isn’t very apparent but that is to be expected. I will probably look for some with a more prominent ruffle instead of a ruffle seam to have more options. On first wear I had some fuzzies come off but nothing crazy.",
