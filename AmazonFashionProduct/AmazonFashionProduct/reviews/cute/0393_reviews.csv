This looks nothing like the picture. It is a very pumpkin orange color.  Due to time constraints and the lack of desire to order another one in hopes that I get the  “right” color just to end up with the same one again I decided to keep it and just send a warning. Sizing and fit is good. I’m 5’ 9” and I ordered an XL. Just nothing close to the pictured color of brick red. Guess I’ll keep it for October. I added a picture of my “brick rid” bra I had purchased this top to lay over. You can see the difference and how orange the top is in comparison to the pic seller is using to market and my bra as well.,4
