The black zipper is a nice feature. Medium is my usual size and it is roomy and comfortable except for the waistband on the pants. It is wide and about 2” too tight to be really comfortable. I had to do a bit of cutting with small scissors to loosen the elastic to make it completely comfortable. I have washed it once on gentle setting in cold water and I put them in a small mesh bag that I use for delicates or items likely to leave lint. The top and pants both came out of the washer fine. There was a little lint left in the mesh bag. Dried them on lowest setting until about half dry then put them on hangers until dry. No shrinkage and the minor wrinkles hung out as they dried. Now it looks great and fits well.,3
