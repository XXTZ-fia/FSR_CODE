It's super versatile and I enjoy finding new ways to style/wear this piece, as the possibilities seem endless.  ☆This arrived in a nice little box. That's a nice change from the usual plastic bag, so I feel it's noteworthy to mention .  ☆This is well constructed with clean and even stitching and hems. There wasn't a single loose thread when this arrived.  ☆The material is wonderful! It is on the thicker side and has great compression. It smooths out any lumps/bumps well. The ribbing gives it great stretch as well as lending to an illusion of a slimmer, longer body. The waist area has a tighter, more compressed ribbing that really snatches the midsection in and creates that beautiful hour glass figure (even if, like me, you have no curves- this will make it look like you do! ) The black romper isn't sheer/see-through at all. The material doesn't loose shape or bag out easily.  ☆Washes well. I wash this on a cold cycle then hang to dry. It doesn't loose shape or elasticity and it dries quite quickly.  ☆Super comfy! I absolutely LOVE how comfortable this is! It's so easy to throw on and wear too. All of my movements are free and unrestricted.  ☆I am 5'7"", 127lbs and 36B. I usually wear a small in clothes but because I have a freakishly long torso, I sized up to a medium in this for the extra length. It fits great. For my long torsoed friends- definitely size up. The extra material lends to the length, so it doesn't seem baggy at all.  ♡This is a great piece for the gym AND wearing around! It's super easy, fun to style and feels/looks incredible on. This is quickly becoming my new ""go to"" piece now that the weather is breaking. I. Definitely ordering more colors!",6

I don’t know that this one makes it to the gym, but it will be cute dressed up with a jacket and heels, I think.
