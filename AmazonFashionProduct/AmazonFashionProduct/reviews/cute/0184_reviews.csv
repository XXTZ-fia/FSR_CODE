Sarah S,Awesome and secure- a great dupe!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IOY8EWBZXHW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B097D59D9V,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 28, 2023",Color: Jasmine GreenSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"Detailed review ahead (girl, be ready for a novel)….I have to say first that I am a die hard lululemon fan, but I work as a choreographer every summer for a well respected theatre camp. Last year, all my lululemon running shorts and most of my tanks were on their last leg. I had heard about these online and wanted to give them a try as an alternative for summer camp, as I could spend less and buy more colors to mix and match. WOW! For the money you can’t go wrong.  I purchased the white, black, denim blue, and jade green tanks and the matching mesh lined high waist running shorts. I am 5’7 and your typical smedium 32dd. I ordered medium across the board. I rapidly lose weight over the summer due to the heat and the exercise. I feel these will fit me if I fluctuate as low as about 15 pounds lighter.  Tanks- These are fantastic. They are not for super high impact, but for lower/ medium impact dance they are great. I can also see myself wearing these all summer as loungewear or with shorts. If I sized down it would’ve given me more cleavage than I wanted. I may try taking in the liner a bit for more security near the end of summer when I’ve dropped weight. Great lululemon dupe. Comfortable and flattering. The ONLY con I have is that the size varied slightly by color. The black and white fit more snug (which I preferred). The denim blue and Jade green fit a little looser as you can see in the side profile picture of the denim blue set.  Shorts- these are great dupes as well! The back pocket completely fits my iPhone XR. The side pocket is super secure and deep. The shorts are slightly longer in the back. The high waist is pretty small and includes about an inch of tighter elastic. I personally like this for camp so my walkie doesn’t pull them down, but if you have more of a square figure it may pay to size up. The tank meets right where these shorts start. My only complaint on these is sometimes the way they lay can look a bit funky in the crotch area, but nothing too major. The colors all looked great. I wore the white with red underwear and it didn’t show through where the mesh liner was.  As a set- Black is perfect and what you’d expect. The white is a CRISP white. Like, it made me pull out my teeth whitener white. It’s beautiful, but literally my Snow White OPI nail polish even looked a tad dingy in comparison. The Jade green shorts were a slightly different shade than the tank. It was not enough for my husband to notice without telling him. For some reason it looks a lot different in the photo but they’re more similar in person. The blue is a pretty darn close match. If anything, the band is slightly different due to the different material. It’s not a dealbreaker for me, as I plan to mix and match a lot  Final thoughts- I love them. I sent both my sisters the links to them, I will live in them all summer, and I will be buying more sets in a variety of colors. Lululemon who?",550

Betsy,The liner is looser and these are SHORT,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35JSBWVYK4WT5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B097D59D9V,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 18, 2022",Color: Wine RedSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I am 5'2"", 140lbs generally a Large bottom. Got these in Medium Wine Red based on reviews and intending to wear them high waisted. They do feel a bit tight around my waist (34in), and they are SHORT worn like this... I cannot imagine a taller person or long legs!! Worn high-waisted these have about a 2in inseam, and it rolls up sometimes when I've been active a while which is really annoying. The back pocket is roomy for my phone (Samsung s10) to have a snug fit and doesn't feel like it flops around when I'm active. The front pocket is on the left side and suitable for a house key or room card or lip balm or something small. The mesh is light and these are light wicking. The liner is loose.... like quite loose. If I had a Large, I would have been swimming in it. So not great if you don't want to wear undies with these! The fabric is a sporty, lightweight fabric as expected and food for watersport as well as an alternative to swim bottoms. If they get wet (red wine color) it's noticeable from sweat or other liquids. The waist band is a softer stretch fabric and feels nice against the skin and nonchafing. These are very well made and high quality shorts. The color is a true wine red and very pretty.",55

My daughter is a lulu snob and asked me “when did you get those lulu shorts”. Will order again in other colors. So far I have pink gray black and blue.

Megan Tanju,“High waisted” may be misleading,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WPME4HNO61RT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B097D59D9V,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 15, 2024",Color: Charcoal GreySize: Small,Verified Purchase,"First off, I would like to say that I like these shorts. They are really comfortable, I like that it has the zipper pocket in the back as well as the little elastic pocket in the front of the waistband, and for the money I’m very happy. So, functional, comfortable, good price and seeming good quality (I’ve had mine about a month and use them at least 1-2x week).  The reasons I wanted to write this review: - “high-rise” vs “Mid-rise:” they don’t provide the coverage I wanted for my midsection (I had hoped to rock a crop top with the shorts the same way I wear crop tops with my high waisted leggings. They do not provide high-rise coverage, and my opinion. In the photo I took here, I pulled the shorts up as high as they were comfortably go. That looks like mid-rise at best to me.) - I don’t like the look. I bought two different styles of high-rise workout shorts off Amazon, and I dislike the fit of both waistbands. This waistband is comfortable, but visually I dislike the look.",38

The color? True to the Amazon post, which is always a relief. And let's talk about that waistband—it's softer than a cloud! The leg material isn't exactly silk, but hey, it's still more comfortable than some of my Nikes from the past.  Now, about the price—can we talk about a steal? Just under $20, and they're giving my pricey Lulus and Athleta shorts a run for their money! Plus, that zipper pocket on the back is a game-changer for stashing my keys or emergency doggy bag stash.

I usually wear under armor athletic shorts and while these are cute, they’re not at the top of my list.  I have fairly muscular legs and some shorts tend to be tight around my thighs, these aren’t. They give room for being flexible without worrying about ripping them BUT the waist band is odd. It doesn’t fall in a natural spot along my waist, too low to sit at my waist, but higher than low rise jeans. Just awkward. I have to pull them up, which makes them super short or push them down, which makes them fit weird.  I ordered an XL, and I’m generally a L to XL in all of my shorts with room because I don’t like them super tight. The waist on these is a little tight, just enough to be annoying, but not enough that the next size up would fit. They also don’t have a functional pocket.

The lining fits snug and the shell is looser but it feels like my thighs are eating them when I move. I definitely wouldn’t be able to wear these while running and they scrunch up a bit while doing strength training. I’ll probably end up wearing them as casual shorts but they won’t be my first choice. For reference, I’m 5,7 and 150, typically a size 6 or medium; I have hips and a butt.

Compared to other notable athletic brands, i think these are high quality for the price. The pictures aren't great to show the fit, but i wanted to show how vibrant the pink is. I LOOOOVE the color. I bought two different pairs both pink, but different shades of pink. This is the ""Bright Pink"" color. The other pair was ""Rose Red"". As some have mentioned, the waistband is pretty tight fitting. I dont mind it, but when I'm just wearing the shorts and my sports bra, it definitely cinches in at my waist, with just the slightest bit of skin bulging over. (the worlds tiniest muffin top) It doesn't bother me enough to not wear them. The other thing that makes the fit a little weird, is that while the waist is tight, the built in briefs are pretty dang loose. And i am not a pancake booty. I have some buns, and the briefs are loose on me. It causes the material where the shorts meet the waistband to give just a little puff thats not the most flattering. I'd rather it lay flatter than poofing out. Anyway, this could all be different with one size up. I'm 5'4"" 127lbs and bought size small. Maybe a medium would eliminate the issues, but c'est la vie.

But the legs fit weird. The split hem is sewn shut. Even when I ripped that seam, you still don't get the range of motion with a good running short. If you take a decent sized stride, the legs will slide up and you might as well be wearing buns.  I'll keep them (since I ripped the seam), but only for lounging around the house and maybe errands. Definitely no workouts.",

Pros- The high waist on these is fantastic Great pockets Pretty color Breathable & quick dry Comfortable  Cons- These shorts don’t move with me. The hem tends to roll up with movement. Since the shorts already have a short inseam, I don’t feel like I can wear them out in public. It’s totally fine for my purposes since I bought them for home workouts, but I’m sure most people expect to be able to wear them out and about.  Fit- I’m normally a 6/8 or M in pants and shorts. I sized up to a L based on others’ comments, and I’m glad I did since I don’t like my workout shorts to be tight.",

I used to be an extra small but had surgery, have sensitivity/swelling on the area, and my weight shifted places. Love that it’s not too tight or too revealing on my back side, and it doesn’t wrinkle which is a bonus for me. The zipper pocket in the back and pocket in front are small- at most you can fit a car key/debit card and a phone, but overall a good deal for the price.",4

I don’t own any so I can’t compare except the look. I love the pink and blue colors I bought. The waist is somewhat compressing seems a bit tight for a medium.  There are no pockets. They are very lightweight and the built in liner is great. I wore them hiking in 90 degree heat and they were pretty good no sweatiness and didn’t ride up much at all. Wish they were cheaper for being Amazon.,9
