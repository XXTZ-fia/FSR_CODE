They are a synthetic material like most yoga wear. I wear a tank or sports bra under them, so that I can wear this around the house while I am working (since I work at home). When I am ready to get some exercise, I can keep the long sleeves if it is chilly, or take it off and just have the tank top. As you can see in the photo, I have a black tank under the olive colored shirt. The tank which is also Artfish is great too. They hit me right at the hip which is perfect with high waisted leggings. I was looking for a low scoop that would show a bit of the tank for a layered look that I can mix and match. I bought lots of colors and I am going to go back and get a couple more that I didn't order. These wash and dry nicely too. They have plenty of stretch so they are good for those of us who are a bit busty, but I think they would be fine on smaller chests too. The olive is a different color than shown in the listing, it is less yellow. I actually like it much better than their photo. It looks more like my photo, although mine is a little dark. The other colors that I got (gray, white, blue, teal, pink and red) are closer to the listing. The teal is nicer in person... a bit darker and more blue, like my photo. And the pink is a little different than their photo too. They have a lot of good bright colors to choose from, but I'd like even more to choose from.
