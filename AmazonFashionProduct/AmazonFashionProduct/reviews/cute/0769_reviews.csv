The length was fine (knew I would be wearing with hight waited pants), the length of the arms was good (I have long arms) ,but a bit baggy/loose and a lot baggy under the armpits, which I am not loving. I do own another style of this shirt (different neck line) from trendy and love everything about that shirt. This v-neck style is just coming up a little less desirable for me (and it is all because of the arms). I do love the feel of the material though.",

I got 3 colors and they look as advertised. The fabric is soft and stretchy. It is a slimmer fit, which I didn’t mind, but if you are a slimmer body type and have boobs above a B cup, it will look weird if you go with your normal shirt size. The seams from the torso of the shirt to the sleeves are too far in and stretch weird, so with having bigger boobs, it makes that seam travel farther in than normal. That is the one thing that is deceptive about the pictures. If you have bigger boobs, go up one or two sizes from your normal size to accommodate for this oversight in the design. I will be rebuying these in a bigger size!",3
