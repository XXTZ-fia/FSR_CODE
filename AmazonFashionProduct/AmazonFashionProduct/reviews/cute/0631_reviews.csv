Ryan,Wife Loves It! Great Quality Sweater!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FVWMXJD1KWK9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9RRHH2T,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Color: CreamSize: Medium,,"We picked this sweater up well before winter, so my wife hasn’t had many chances to wear it until the last month or so. In that time, she’s been really impressed with both the quality and the overall fit, even with its oversized design. My wife loves oversized sweaters, and this one absolutely fits the bill—it’s cozy, stylish, and exactly what she was hoping for.  One thing to keep in mind is the size of the holes in the knit. Since this is a high-gauge knit sweater, air does pass through certain parts of the design, making it better suited for layering. It’s perfect for pairing with a long-sleeve top or thermal underneath, but it might not be ideal as your only layer on a really cold day.  In this price range, there is certainly a lot of great competition you could choose from, but I will say the quality of the sweater goes a long way towards warranting its price. All in all, as long as you’re planning to layer it, I think you’ll be really happy with this one. It’s a great combination of comfort, style, and quality!",
