They do not look or feel cheap. The waistband is thick too.  I ordered a large based on the reviews. I had to return and size up because of my hips and butt.

E.

I went with an XL, despite the recommended Large and I’m so glad I did! These aren’t fully baggy, but more of a “loose fit”. There isn’t much structure to these, as they’re made from a cotton material, but they’re loose enough for what I wanted. The coloring can scrape off with your thumbnail. The good thing about them is that if I wear them and my hip, they’re easily long enough (low rise style for those who were older than 12 in the ‘90s/‘00s!). They’re not lined and the fabric, while being a cotton blend of some kind, isn’t stiff. They’re definitely not what you’d think of when you consider cargo pants. But hey, they were less than $30 (before tax) so they’re not breaking the bank.",

(Just under 5’2”) I currently weigh around 135 which is at the heavier end of my normal spectrum, but they have a drawstring so they would fit well even on a much thinner frame, depending on the bagginess desired. The material has a good thickness to it without being heavy or restricting. The inner pockets are interesting as they are made of what seems to be the same material that tents and rain flys are made out of… But it’s really not an issue for me at all.
