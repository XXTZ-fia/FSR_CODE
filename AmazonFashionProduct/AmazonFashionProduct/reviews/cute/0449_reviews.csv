It's seriously adorable! The shorts are pretty soft. The top is less cozy/soft of a feel, but it's right on par with other cute little toddler sets I've snagged on Amazon in the past. My experience is that the material lasts for a long time (my daughter was tiny and would wear these sets for like 9 months when she was a baby) and washes pretty well with a decent stain remover.  The color green is very olive-esque, which I adore. The shorts are a great neutral light heather gray that will go with tons of other things. This will be a great spring/summer set!  One thing I will say...if you're questioning the size, I would size up! My little guy turns 1 this month. He's a little on the tall/chunky side, and is just breaking into 12-18 month clothes. I got the 18-24 months for him, hoping it would last all summer. It was definitely the right call. The shorts come down just below his knees right now, and the shirt has a little bit of an oversized look to it, but I do think that if I had gotten his 12-18 month size, it would have shrunk after 1 wash and not worked very long for us.  Overall, absolutely ADORABLE. I would totally spend the money on it!",4
