I’m very picky on my materials & the quality of fabric used in athletic styles and this dress is well made. The fabric & stitching is well done. The material itself is not too thick, it’s breathable. I am in between sizes- I’m a M/L depending on stretching of fabrics. I have an athletic build (powerlifter), weigh 170lbs; Hips 45”, Bust 32”, Waist 30”, Thighs 25”. This dress smooths & tightens in all the right places. I probably could’ve sized down for a tighter fit to a medium, but I like to be able to have some room in my outfits so I am happy ordering the L! When going to the bathroom you do have to pull it over your shoulders so if you are more broad there I would consider sizing up as to not wear & tear the stitching on the arm area from taking on/off. This dress does not have padding on the top. I don’t feel like it’s needed since it’s double lined but if you have more going on up top that’s something to consider.  If you’re debating ordering this dress just go ahead and order it. You won’t regret it!!",17
