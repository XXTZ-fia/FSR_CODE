I buy these when I need a top to layer under something, like a strappy dress, or when I need a top in a specific color for a one-off outfit. As an example, I wanted a forest green tee to wear under an Anthropologie pinafore. The color isn’t very common, and most of the top is covered by the dress, so this worked. I would not get these as a staple.  If you want a bodycon, Y2K fit then order your normal clothing size. If you want a relaxed fit, I would size up.",
