From the moment I put it on, it felt like being wrapped in a warm, soft cloud. The fleece is so cozy, and it keeps me extra warm, which is perfect for cold nights.  I love the fit. The top is just the right amount of roomy, and the wide-leg pants are super comfortable without feeling sloppy. It’s great for relaxing at home and feels way more put-together than most loungewear.  What really impressed me is how well it holds up after washing. I’ve had fleece lose its softness in the past, but this set came out looking and feeling just as good as new. No pilling, no shedding, just as cozy as when I first got it.  If you’re someone who loves to feel warm and comfortable, this is perfect. I’ve been wearing it constantly, and it’s worth every penny. Highly recommend!",

My gifter chose XL for me, Im currently in between L and XL as I attempt to lose weight....and while the pants seem to fit pretty well, at least in the waistband, the shirt is HUGE. It drapes well past both my shoulders and the sleeves are very long, which normally I would love, except they are also very wide - so rolling them up to wash dishes or do any cleaning doesn't really help since they don't stay rolled well.  I was gifted the teal green color which is perfect for my seasonal color palette (I'm a cool summer) and it can be very hard to find clothes that fall under this palette so I appreciate that. If I could return this and get a size down I would, but the return date is past and I was not the original buyer.

After just two wears, the waistband of the pants completely unraveled, which was disappointing for a set that seemed so promising.  It’s now sitting in my ‘fix or ditch’ pile, but honestly, it’s just not worth the thread to repair. While the fit and design were flattering, the durability left much to be desired.
