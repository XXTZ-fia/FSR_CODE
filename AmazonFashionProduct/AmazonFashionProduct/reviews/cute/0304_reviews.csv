The problem is that the first time I wore it, the stitching was coming off on the side, whereas I had a 1 inch hole that I had to deal with while I was at work when I wore it. I don’t have a physically strenuous job. I sit at a desk so ultimately, I’m just gonna blame it on the stitching. The fit was not tight. I just think it had defective stitching. I can easily fix it, but the problem is when you buy something new you don’t expect it to start falling apart the first time you wear it",
