I tried it on and was immediately annoyed by how much shorter it is than what the picture shows.  The material is in no way soft and cozy, more like just shy of being scratchy. The pockets are the weirdest part of this item. They have these horrible, long, single pieces of thread holding the two corners of the pockets to the sweater on the inside which I  can already tell will not survive regular wear. Overall, it's a far cry from a ""stylish"" sweater like the tag boasts, more like poorly designed trash. Will never buy from this brand again.",
