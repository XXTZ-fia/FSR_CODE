However, I am glad I ordered it anyway because now I know how amazing it is. The material is crazy soft and feels so smooth. It is also very comfortable and the color is just like in the picture! I highly recommend, it really hugs your figure but also is stretchy at the same time. The double lined part is also a huge bonus.",

I am really impressed by the material as well, it is incredibly soft and high quality and feels similar to my similar, much more expensive name brand tops. The top does have some stretch but doesn't thin out or become too see through which I really like. I am usually a small/medium and didn't want this to be too fitted so I went with the medium and it fits perfectly. The neckline is very flattering and there's plenty of room in the bust so it doesn't get too tight and flatten things out. I'll be getting a lot of wear out of this. Highly recommend!",

It’s sooo pretty on her, not too tight and not too loose either. It fits just right how it’s supposed to. She’s a size M and I’d say it’s true to size also. The color is a beautiful shade you don’t really get that option color too often either which is another reason I picked it out for her!",
