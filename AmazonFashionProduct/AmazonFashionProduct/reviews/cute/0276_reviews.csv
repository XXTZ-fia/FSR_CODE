The material is thick, soft and feels like it has a bit of stretch. The cut and design is so flattering and sporty like. I got it in a size one up bc I didn’t want it too cropped. It fits perfect. The stitching and cut is done well. Has two side pockets that meet in the middle. Nice thick large hood for full coverage if chose. Long silver tone smooth zipper that goes all the way down to mid chest when unzipped. Nice seams on the wrists of the sleeves. Washes really well. I have washed worn twice on cool and always air dried. The one thing I will say it does pick up fabric fibers easily so lint brush seems to be needed often. It’s very comfortable and very flattering on the body. My daughter is 8 and I purchased a size larger, 10 I think. I would love this in beige or another color. It’s really made well and has a thick material. Definitely should last over time. I like how the cut is different than your typical hoodie sweatshirt. Sleeve length has plenty of room. Plus the zipper in the center is very trendy now. My daughter thinks it’s comfortable and really like it.",6

We went with the largest size and it fits like a women's XS/S. My sister is shown in the photos and she is 5'3"" and has a petite build.
