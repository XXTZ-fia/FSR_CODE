It worked for me.  The top seems a little big but I’ll make it work.  There is no hook on the back of the top.  It’s all elastic like a sports bra.  It’s a really cute swim suit for the price.,

It fits very well and had good support in the top. The bottoms are a little bigger than the top seems to be. I thought the colorful bands on the top and bottom were high quality and study… that was until they started to unravel the first time wearing it. One of the straps on the top also ripped but I fixed it easily. The colors of the suit were lovely it looks just like the photo. The padding and lining were also good quality. I don’t think I would buy it again just because of the quality of the bands and straps since I won’t be able to wear it again after one use… at least not at $25.,
