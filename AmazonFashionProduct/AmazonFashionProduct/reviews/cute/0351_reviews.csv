It’s hard to put on bc it’s made out of the same material athletic leggings are made of. Sizing up is also important to avoid cameltoe with this fit. Also don’t expect to wear a bra with straps if you don’t want them showing due to how wide the neckline is.,

A little too much cleavage for me but I am planning on throwing a sweater over it for the cooler weather. But I feel comfortable in it and it’s really cute.  I am 5’3 so the bottom of the pants sit right where I want it to. Might look like high waters on anyone taller. Overall I am happy with it. :),19

If i could wear it anywhere on any given day best believe I would. The quality is so smooth and nice also very thick and stretchy material. Fits u like a glove for sure. It runs true to size ( I got a large ). I have been seeing quite a lot of people say that it was short on them and i can see that but for me who is a 5’3 tall person it’s perfect. You hear me. So good in the length department. If i had the option to rate half stars i would rate it 4.5/5 because the stitching at the top where the top of the bar is has came lose and is gone. ( Just half of it but maybe in the future the rest will go ) , but i will and have already gotten over that it’s still together in one piece and working wonderfully fine today. Also people are saying if you bend over your boobs will fall out a bit, yeah that true but not the dramatic of course. Look at it this way if you hold ur boobs with your arm like your hugging them and bend over then that’s a little bit how it would be wearing this for my experience. Big boobs+gravity= big spillage. Small boobs+gravity= small spillage. Itty bitty titty committee= you know the deal. Anyways those are literally my only cons about this piece. My ONLY cons. I don’t work out but im thinking about starting to go for walks in the mornings more often, and this will for sure be my number one go-to walking fit. (Whenever it’s clean) It’s so comfortable guys. I can’t get over it. I would sleep in it if i could. ( i may or may not have already ( don’t judge i was tired from school and clocked out once I hit the bed)). Lastly my measurements are 5’3, 204 lbs, and I believe im a 36 C cup. I would add a video but kinda don’t feel like it if I can edit this maybe i’ll add it later. Hope this helps you guys! :D",
