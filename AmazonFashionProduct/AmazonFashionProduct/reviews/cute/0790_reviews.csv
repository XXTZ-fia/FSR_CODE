And not a good quality one at that it was thin, nothing like the photo, a plain crewneck T-shirt poor Quality and not flattering unfortunately I ordered it right before the birthday party so I had no time to exchange it.

Made of 79% Polyester, 16% Viscose and 5% Eiastane the combination of these synthetics makes for a soft and warm fabric that feels good to the touch. The quality of stitching is excellent through out all parts of the shirt. Following the laundering instructions I washed & dried it twice and it held its shape and color. I bought this for my 12 year old niece and the measurements are as follows: The shoulder width  seam to seam is 12.5"", the sleeve length seam to end of cuff is 21"" and the length from  the front of the crew neck down to the bottom of the shirt is 20"". It came with lots of wrinkles in it (due to packaging) and I found I had to iron it on a setting between delicate fabrics and wool with steam to get them out. I have a steam iron and that setting worked pretty good. You may have to play around with your iron settings before ironing the shirt.

I don't know if that was an error on my part or the seller's but I thought I ordered a size 7-8 and I got a 13-14 instead and so there is no way this is going to fit my daughter... for years. It's huge on her. The fabric feels nice though, even if it is a little thin. And I like that the sleeves have tight cuffs to keep them from falling off.

Since it arrived vacuum sealed, I wanted to try to remove some of the wrinkles. But I didn't want to risk it shrinking until I know if it will fit my granddaughter. The wrinkles came out in a short wash, and I hung it up to dry immediately. A few hours later I could see a bit of the ""sheen"" of the fabric, which is quite pretty. I ordered red, which has a hint of pink in it, but not too much. It's a lovely color!  I'm quite impressed with this top, so I hope to find more from this manufacturer before Christmas!",
