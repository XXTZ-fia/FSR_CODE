I like that the long sleeves keep my arms warm in the winter and the shorts don't get twisted up while I sleep like pants do. Love that they have a nice elastic waistband and pockets on the shorts! The only negative is that the waffle knit and material make it a little 'sticky' when not wearing it. The material sticks to itself in drawers and coming out of the dryer and catches every little bunch of fuzz or hair that clumps a little in the dryer. Even with plenty of fabric softener. Easy to just pick off and remove, and then just unstick from itself and fold. It's not static electricity, but basically acts the same. However, once you put it on, there is no issue with it feeling clingy. It's not overly soft like some materials, but is in no way way rough or uncomfortable. It has enough weight that it feels good to wear and isn't too light. I definitely love the set, find it  comfortable, and enjoy wearing. I'd definitely recommend, just check it for fuzzies out of the dryer.",
