Has a nice thickness that elevates it from a standard cotton tshirt. Just be aware that this is definitely a layering piece: looks great under a sweater or vest without adding bulk or heat, or a jacket if you don't plan on taking the jacket off. If hugs every bump and lump, so if you're ok with all that showing then go for it and wear it alone, but if you're busty this is probably going to be too much on it's own, at least it is for me. This suits my needs perfectly because I was looking for a less-bulky and fitted shirt to wear under overalls, sweaters with a wider neckline, and thin jackets, and I love the high neckline of this shirt and how soft and kind of silky the fabric is. The large may look super small when you pull it out of the package but it fit me great; I typically wear a large and this fit as expected without being cropped.",18
