The polarized lenses are a game-changer, effectively blocking out 100% of harmful UVA and UVB rays and reducing glare, making them perfect for driving, outdoor activities, and bright, sunny days.

They are, in my opinion, for someone with a larger head or facial features.  The quality felt cheap. As you open the arms, you can feel the frame flex. Exactly the opposite of a sturdy pair. Will return. On the plus, they came with a tool to tighten the screws on it's frame, as well as a fabric protective bag.  Price point is not on par with the quality, comparably to other avail items on Amazon.",4

Not bad quality and comes with a bag and cleaning cloth.  Only exception is they are not very BLUE.  More like a light grey with a SLIGHT blue tint.  The picture is slightly deceiving.  This is the problem with a lot of photos online using different lighting and filters.  ( see photo ),4
