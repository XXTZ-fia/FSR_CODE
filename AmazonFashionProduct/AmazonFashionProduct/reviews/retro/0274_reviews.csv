It did run small in our opinion-glad we ordered a size bigger. BUT it came really shrink wrapped and impossible to get the wrinkles out. He had to wear it for a 60's party. I was beside myself. Nothing with much heat if you follow directions so wrinkles don't come out with ironing. Not supposed to dry so put in wrinkle setting in dryer and sprayed with water-wrinkles didn't budge. Steamed-nope!!  I wrote the seller mid Friday and they couldn't get back to until Monday. Party was Sat. and I explained that. I needed their help. I feel for wasting a whole day on this shirt there should be compensation. Why would a company shrink wrap a shirt of that material as it sets the wrinkles in permanently? Now funny thing I read the reviews and no one mentions shrink wrap. hmmm  Someone came in with the same shirt at the party so you know I had to ask if it were shrink wrapped...nope --box and tissue. The company got back to me Monday and they are saying I can't deal with them I have to deal with Amazon.????? They are very evasive and not helpful at all. The shirt would be a great shirt minus the permanent tons of wrinkles",
