I wanted something fun and vibrant so I went to Amazon for a retro bowling shirt. I’ve purchased actual bowling shirts from Amazon in the past being a big Two and Half Men fan and they were in $40-$50 dollar range. Obviously those shirts are two colored fabric stitched together and the fabric has some weight to it. When I can across these I didn’t know what to expect but for half the price I had a pretty good idea. I could tell they were not two different fabrics stitched together but more of print style just by the pictures, but decided to give them a try. Pleasantly surprised. I have broad shoulders so I always order 3x. They were a perfect fit. The length is perfect too. As others have stated they are very thin but for me in the Florida heat that’s a major plus. They are silky, light and comfortable and the colors are very vibrant. Had many compliments on them. I purchased two different styles and they were both exactly as pictured. Two thumbs up.",
