The fabric is stretchy, forgiving, and comfortable.  It would be really cute one someone with the right build.  I felt like the dress's big, heart-shaped buttons made it look at bit more like a costume, but that's a matter of taste.  Others may think it adds to the cuteness.  It would be easy to sew on different buttons if you don't like them.  If you're not sure about sizing, it runs big.  I'm 5' 4"" and 130 lbs.  The size medium was too big for me.  I had to return it.  I didn't reorder a size small because the dress is cut for women with fuller busts.  The waist of the dress fit well, but the top was too baggy.  My arms came no where close to filling out the sleeves, so the sleeve fabric stuck straight out a bit awkwardly.  The dress fell several inches below my knees (longer than I expected).  If you're petite like me, this dress probably isn't for you. If you're bigger on top and/or tall, this dress would probably be prefect for you!",2

I can't tell how well it's made, as it was clearly too big for me. I think the ""waist"" in the size guide might be referring to pants waist size which... Isn't usual for dresses, but it would be closer to accurate, so take that into account.  I'm torn on ordering down a size because one reason I went for it was it was listed as 95% cotton, which you can see is not true. It's 0% cotton. I strongly prefer cotton and linen for my dresses and skirts so not sure if I'll reorder or not.

But not this baby! The top is big enough for my boobs and the waist is small enough to provide shape. (Yes, it’s still technically too high and could stand to be taken in an inch or two, but with the belt, it’s totally doable.)
