I wore this while playing on violin for two hours and it never gave me any issues (but I got a TON of compliments). The dress has a cute vintage look but I recommend a petticoat if you are want it to sit with more volume- otherwise the fabric is heavier and sits flatter on the body in the skirt area. Wrinkles very easy and must be dry cleaned. Size is exact - I’m 5’3”, 125 lbs and the small fit like a glove.",2

The fabric has a nice amount of stretch, and more fitted would still be comfortable. Zipper is nice quality for the price and feels like it will last a while. The color looked a bit darker, this piece is a little brighter, which is ok, however, I was hoping for a deeper hue. The material is thick enough to feel well made, but not restrictive.",4

The only complaint I have is, being so petite, the top puckers out and looks a little big/baggy so I have to keep pulling the dress down so it doesn't bulge. Otherwise, I'd recommend this dress!",3

It wrinkles kinda easy and needs to be dry cleaned. But it worked great for me. I only needed it to work for about 5 nights for a show. The bow is not connected to the dress. I wasn't expecting that. It is just a long fabric piece that you tie around your waist. So, you can put the bow wherever you want... front, back, side. I think if I were a bit taller, it would have sat on me better.

This is why I hardly ever shop through Amazon. This dress is not worth 35 dollars let alone 10 dollars. Also it just came in a zip lock bag. It wasn't even really packaged. The dress could have easily been taken out of the bag and stolen. Amazon's refund & return policy is absolute garbage.
