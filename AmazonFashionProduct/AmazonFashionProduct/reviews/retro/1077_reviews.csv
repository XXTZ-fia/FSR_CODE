Might try Sojos again, i bought these because of the polarization and  style.",

But of course, we had no doubt at all that we would be normally like the frames that this vendor releases. We’ve actually started to have kind of a collection over here. This is a very classy red and very low-key frame that is still chic and stylish, and I felt like it was a perfect gift for somebody a little older who was taken to more chic and classic frame designs. The person I ordered these for has a more rounded head and jaw, and these frames do look good on them. They don’t add too much and they don’t overpower their natural face shape.",

However these are 20x better. They are extremely lightweight & comfortable. They fit so well and the style is exactly what I was searching for. The rectangular shape and style works great on those with heart shaped faces. The best thing about this is definitely the sun protection. I went with these instead of the other competitors because of this and it was well worth the money.,2

They have red-pink lenses, not burgundy, but these are a fun variation.  The polarized effect is great, making driving and errands in the sun so much clearer.  You do get a 'rose-colored glasses' tinted view of everything.  The shading is light to medium, so not too dark.The hinges on the temples are a bit stiff to open, but I need this to keep them on. Once open, they are very comfortable to wear.  The frames are a contemporary rectangle design, in a solid, opaque, deep red plastic color.  Cute and well-made.",
o. sternberg,Great Sunglasses,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GAA31NS9W1V7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7VP19YJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 15, 2024",Color: C4-redLens Color: Red,,"These are the perfect pair of ""rose-colored lenses."" They color the world is such a beautiful wash of pink. When I wear them I feel like I am living in the most beautiful sunset for hours on end. The dark red shade of the frames themselves is beautiful, and I've loved added them as an accessory to many different outfits. The shape of the lenses is a bit more slender than I realized, but I am very happy with that. They have a very ""2000s"" look to them that I think is very flattering and chic. The glasses came packed with a little carrying pouch and a cleaning cloth, so that was a lovely surprise. I really like these glasses and I highly recommend them if you're looking for something cool and different to add to your eyewear collection.",

And they cut out enough sunlight so I can see easily outside and they're also good when I drive.  They look well made, they don't creak when I open the eye pieces to put them on, like one pair I got at TJ Maxx! Overall, I'm pleased with these.",

I like the look and the size, they are as pictured. They fit my head pretty snug and I would say my head is on the smaller side, but it’s definitely not too tight or anything. If you do have a wider face, it might be a bit tight. I like the tint on these, it’s a pretty warm tint so it provides sun protection without making everything way too dark. Overall these are a cute and trendy piece I am glad to add to my collection of sunnies!",
Wendy Reviews,Nice Glasses - Good UV Protection,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CUHUB2DARE9R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7VP19YJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 1, 2024",Color: C4-redLens Color: Red,,"These VANLINKER Retro Rectangle Polarized Sunglasses are nice. I have a small face and it is difficult to find glasses that fit the width of my face. These glasses have a snug but comfortable fit. I would suggest that if you have a wider face, the fit might not be right for you.  The hinges on the earpieces are quite stiff. It is nice for holding the glasses firmly on your head. However, I wonder if it could cause them to break easier after they are worn a while. Only time will answer that question.  I ordered the red ones with reddish tinted lenses. I really believe this tint color makes everything look brighter and sharper! The lenses have UV protection for your eyes. A polarized testing card is included. When you look at the card without wearing polarized lenses, all you will see is a silver hexagon. Then when you put the sunglasses on and look at the card you will see a V in the center of the silver hexagon. This shows you that the lenses are polarized.  Eyeglasses and their fit are a very subjective thing. For that reason I will just say that I am pleased with this pair of sunglasses.",

One day those sunglasses broke and I figured I could easily buy them again… nope. Looked everywhere for similar sunglasses and finally stumbled upon these. I just received them and I am super stoked! First, these are black, which mine before were tortoise so I’m actually more happy with the colour. Second, I can already tell that they are much better quality. The arms aren’t flimsy when you bend them, the plastic just feels thicker than regular plastic sunglasses. All I can say is they just feel and look better quality. Third, the sunglasses are super cute, trendy and polarized which is great for protection!! Finally, they also came with a cloth and a little bag which I wasn’t expecting, but pleasantly surprised with. I love these!",
