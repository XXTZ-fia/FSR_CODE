(They were in the case in my pocket and still got damaged in the crush!) so I came here and reordered the same exact ones with green mirrored lenses.  But there is a LOT less mirroring and the lenses are now more blue than green. The arms move stiffly and the whole pair feels more cheaply made.  Sending them back in disappointment.

I did not get anything on the lense to cause this and there is no way to feel the damage from either side of the lens, it is internal.  In my opinion, there is nothing I could have done to prevent this from happening as they do not get abused, and they do not sit in a hot car.
