It has a nice style and is lightweight enough for the mild winters we get in the south. It is a roomy true-to-size. I usually wear an 18/20US and ordered an XL and it fits comfortably. I will definitely be wearing it this winter.  All that said, I have one big issue. The jacket is much shorter than it look in the pictures, and I am short at 5'4. The jacket hits right at my waist rather than the hip as shown. It is disappointing because I was hoping for something longer. If I had had a specific outfit in mind I would have been extremely annoyed at just how different it looks as a shorter jacket.  One last note, when I took it out of the package, the fabric felt stiff and had a chemically smell. I washed with like items on a normal cycle and dried on medium heat and the smell was gone and the fabric feels much softer. I did not take off any stars for this but it is Wirth noting in case someone wants to buy it and wear it right away. It will not be a pleasant experience. On the positive side, it washed well and had no noticeable shrinkage.",

But, it's nice when you are a double X and something fits you the way it fits the model who is wearing the item you order-  with a slight baggy appearence, but for the most part, form fitting (if you look at the Amazon model and agree with me that's how the jacket fits her). I love wearing this jacket- it is even appropriate for some colder summer nights in Ohio (as well as spring, autumn and warmer winter days and nights) and I feel that it matches jeans and yoga pants well (at least when I wear them ;).
