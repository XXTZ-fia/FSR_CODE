So points for that. They even come with a little card you can use to test them and I've tried it with other sunnies I have and it seems legit to my uninformed self.  2nd the plastic or whatever they are made of is so cheap feeling. It's extremely lightweight and makes a strange sound when you tap your nails on the plastic for instance. I have many sunnies and these seem the ""cheapest"". The hinges though, are pretty good. You can wiggle them around in either direction so they seem to be less fragile in that regard. Again, they are very cute so I will deal with this stuff no problem.  Finally, I don't think I have a big head. Typically sunnies feel like they're too big for my face or I always just wish they were a bit smaller. We'll, these ones are pretty small! I can see my eyebrows while wearing them and the bows actually have to stretch out a little to fit around my head. Felt weird at first but now I'm used to it and I really like the size.
