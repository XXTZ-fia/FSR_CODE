The construction is fine. The fit of the dress is flattering. The bust is a bit tight; it’s made in a way that pushes the girls up and together so keep that in mind. If you’re particularly busty you might want to size up. The dress itself is a bit stretchy so there’s some give. I will say however that the material feels very cheap and stiff. When it arrived, it was horribly wrinkled. It’s definitely not something you can wear right out of the package. Even after steaming it, when I wore it it wrinkled badly every time I sat down.  I think it would be great for a costume, but not so much for every day use. In my opinion it’s overpriced.",
