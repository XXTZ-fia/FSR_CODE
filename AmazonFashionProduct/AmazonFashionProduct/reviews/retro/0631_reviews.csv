Some of the reviews made me nervous so I was soooo excited when the shirt arrived in one day. It's perfect including the front image being aligned right. I got a mens medium. I am short and a lil big in the middle but I can button it but the bottom button which is fine cuz I can wear the shirt with one side tucked in the way folks are wearing shirts. I'll say that the fabric has a lot of complaints from folks expecting something thicker. Most bowling shirts were made of light fabric back in the day!
