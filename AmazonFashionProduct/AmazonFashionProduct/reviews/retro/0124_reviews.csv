BUT with some caveats:  1. It's one single layer. The fabric is nice at least, but a dress really needs more than just one thin layer. The good news is that the fabric is just thick enough to not be see through. 2. The skirt does not fan out like the picture. Likely because it's literally just one sheet of fabric. You will need to buy a petticoat skirt to go underneath.  But otherwise the design/look is spot on. The fit of the dress works really well and you could tie the straps shorter if you need the top/chest part to fit better. I have to disagree with the other review about chest size: I have a smedium chest and the medium fit perfectly. Follow the size chart.  My expectations for the quality of this dress were average/less than average and the product pleasantly surprised me.",3

I am a chesty girl 44DD. Usually around 16-18 pants but 2x-3x top. Tried 4X because unfortunately I know plus sizing is never accurate. I do give this brand props because I was able to zip this dress. Very stretchy fabric on the top and I absolutely love that. Unfortunately where it hit me was directly under the bust line and not at the waist so I had this unfortunate pregnant look/feeling going on so I ended up returning it.,2

867-5309,Pink and white checkered Barbie tie shoulder dress: weird fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TKZGB403CT0W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLZY3B2X,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 25, 2023",Color: PinkSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"This was going to be my Halloween outfit for Barbie, but I'm going to have to really fix the top wildly for this to work.  It is longer than expected, and the top is made for giant armpit holes and massive side boob. The belt is long (can go around 3x). The very weirdest part, though, is the top. It's made for a linebacker's chest, ultra wide and awkward. It seems like the only way to fix it would be to fold in a bunch of extra material and sew it and cut it off, but then the strap location might be a bit weird.  This dress would work if you're 5'5"" with giant boobs. If you're shorter than that, it's going to look long (past the knee). If you do not have giant boobs, add on some extra socks to your order to stuff your bra with to pull this one off.  The material is silky and nice.",5
