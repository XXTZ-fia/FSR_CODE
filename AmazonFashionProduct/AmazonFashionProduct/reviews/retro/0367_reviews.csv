I'm not even sure how it happened so I do wish they were slightly more resistant to that. They do reduce glare well with their polarized lenses. My eyes are very sensitive to light though & I find these allow more light in than I'd prefer on very bright days. I think the size is well suited to smaller faces. In fact, I have them pictured on my 8 year old in my photos & they're really a great fit for her. When I put them on they're fine for a while but they will start to feel a bit tight after so long.",

They fit great, look great on, are lightweight, and I love being able to choose the color according to what I'm wearing or doing that day. All the while they are protecting my eyes from UV rays and glare while giving me noticeable visual clarity.  I appreciate the lenses are made from TAC (tri-acetate cellulose, not 'tactical'). TAC is known for offering polarization, clarity, scratch resistance, reducing glare, and is lightweight. Every one of these features I noticed when I put on Dushine's sunglasses. This is not just plain plastic.  The first thing I that got my attention when I put on Dushine's sunglasses is the instant clarity. Wow! It's noticeable and appreciated. I can also tell the lenses are polarized, not just by the small test card they give, but how there is a sheer prismatic rainbow effect that happens on certain surfaces, most noticeably cars. (I also love some of the iridescent color shifts it gives to some cars when they drive by. It's a very cool effect.)  Despite my effort to be gentle with my new set of sunglasses, I've managed to drop each one the first day I wore them and on subsequent days. A couple of my sunglasses fell down right on the concrete! Ugh! And yet, surprisingly, they have not yet scratched. Whew! Here's to hoping it's TAC's scratch resistance doing its job.  These sunglasses have been a joy to use anytime I am outdoors. They're attractive, comfortable, and very useful for driving. I keep my sunglasses in color-coordinating sheaths by my door. I love them and would gladly buy this set again or another trio to further expand my color choices.",
