So I'm always on the lookout for decent pairs that won't break the bank. These Sojos aviators definitely fit the bill.  They look pretty sharp, and they feel surprisingly sturdy for the price. I've been wearing them for a few weeks now, and they've held up well, even with me tossing them in my bag and generally not being super careful with them.  Obviously, they're not going to be the same quality as a pair of Ray-Bans or anything, but for the price, they're fantastic. Honestly, they look and feel better than most of the other cheap sunglasses I've tried from Amazon. If you're looking for a good-looking, affordable pair of aviators, these are definitely worth checking out.",

I've bought these as gifts for other people, and as stated, I believe this is my fourth pair.  I tend to dislike sunglasses that just tint everything, as usually they aren't protecting my eyes from UV, so everything is dark and I still can't see well.  These are great at filtering out the UV with minimal tinting, even though these look full on reflective. The result is, if it's bright and sunny, it still looks bright and sunny, and I don't have to squint my eyes. There are many styles to fit whatever kind of glasses you like, the aviator style works for me. They also stay in place for the most part, so I'm not constantly adjusting them.  The glasses come with a carrying pouch and cleaning towel. The customer service is great as well!",
