Very comfortable out of the box with no blisters or any rubbing. Supportive enough for many miles of walking in varied conditions. True to size. Still look great. Only issue was keeping the laces tied tightly but that may be my tying method. Recommend.,

Yesterday was the first time I spent the full day in them as well as walking around IKEA. I started feeling an uncomfortable feeling at the heel end of my arch. By the time I got home, my heel/arch area was tender, swollen, and bruised all the way up to my ankle.  I’m extremely disappointed and won’t be buying Keens again.",

They are so comfortable and effortlessly so. I've worn them non-stop out and about the last few days. No rub spots. No strain, no pain. PERFECT!!!!  ************************************** Straight outta the box these were comfortable. I am compatible with Keen in general. These are cute and comfortable. As a large footed person that's a RARE combo!  I have big feet. 10 1/2 or 11 sometimes 10 depending on the brand. I usually wear Saucony but once I went Hoka it was hard to go back to Saucony, they just don't have the support and something was off on the width regardless if I go wide. I've had trouble finding Hoka locally to try on so enter Keen. I've had a pair of hiking shoes which have been amazing. I ordered a pair of sandals last summer which I also love. But I needed something to replace my 2+ yr old Hokas for everyday wear, walking, errands etc. I don't have an extra wide foot, it's just big but I've never had any issues with Keen as is. I definitely think they have a comfortably ample toe box.  These shoes have a retro feel to them. They almost remind me of the Roos back in elementary in the 80s. 😂 Minus the pocket.  Anyhow if you know Keen, they are a decent shoe at many price points. This one is no different. Not only found them on sale so they are even less than Hokas.  I'll definitely update once I wear them out and about. But just walking around the house they are very comfortable.  For the win!",2

The width also felt more like a wide than a regular fit. Additionally, there was absolutely no arch support or padding in the sole, which was surprising and frustrating.

I love the neutral color option. They are very comfortable. I was shocked that they make a woman's size 12. They fit perfectly. I would say true to size, but possibly on the wider side for women's shoes. Which works out even better for me. My normal size is a men's 10.5-11 or a women's 12, sometimes women's 11 Wide depending on the shoe. Price is midrange for what I would call a good pair of shoes.",

I never can tell which ones I am going to like and which I won't, but I definitely like these.I am glad I did not listen to the ""7.5 will fit you best based on data from customers"" because I know now that if I had followed that advice, the shoes would have been tighter than I liked.  I bought the 8, which also makes sense because I have very wide feet, and I like them a lot already!Now these are not quite as smooth feeling on the inside as some other brands I've tried.  I think I'll be needing to wear socks.  But that's okay - I don't mind wearing socks, and most of the time I prefer to wear them anyway.  Included with these shoes was something that resembles paracord attached to one shoe through the laces.  I have NO idea what the point of that is, but maybe I'll eventually figure it out.At time of review, these shoes are priced at $82.48....which seems to be about in line with Keen shoes of this type in general.
