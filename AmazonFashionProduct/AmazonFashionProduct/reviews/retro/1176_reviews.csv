Linda P.,Adorable but not long enough to tuck into everything,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMGCMWZ3F1S8T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09L4R6Q97,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 13, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"This is gorgeous.  Looks just like in the pics.  Except I did get the idea the fabric would be thicker but it is actually very thin - not see through but very thin.  Is also a fabric that will need ironing.  Lastly, I would prefer if it were a little longer so it could tuck comfortably into various waist heights without the risk of slipping out.  High waist would be totally fine.  Mid waist it does tuck fine but will likely slip out and need to be re-tucked throughout the day.  Low rise would not work well unless you want to wear it untucked, but it's pretty shapeless then in my opinion.  So those are some drawbacks BUT it's gorgeous enough that I'm keeping it as with the right outfit it will be super cute!",
