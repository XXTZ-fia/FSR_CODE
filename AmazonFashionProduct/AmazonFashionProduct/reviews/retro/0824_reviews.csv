When I went to order it, my size was not available.  Grabbed it as soon as it was back.  It is a great year round blouse.  Cold months, a blaser or cardigan work great.  I seem to be between sizes, so it is a little extra roomy.  The one thing that is a pain are the sleeve bows.  I wish the were tacked in bow form.  As is typical for sleeve ties, they ope after a while.  You need someone to retie for you.  I plan to ties the bows and tack it in place. The v-neck is mot low, so it is appropriate for everything.  I prefer a bit of a modest top.  I am a 36C and there is plenty of room left for larger cups.  A padded bra fills out the shirt a little more, to really shows a nice figure with this style, with out being revealing or tight.  It is a light fabric that allows the body to have air.  Though, I do not recommend the white blouse for hot sweaty days.  I tend to have a cami underneath as I can get warm, just to help prevent some sweat staining.  Great fun shirt to mix up instead of the typical plain blouse you wear to work.  Though vintage styled, ir does not look old fashioned.  It is all in accessorising and how worn in an outfit.  I will likely order solid blouses in the future to coordinate with various bottoms, patterened or solid.  It just makes me smile more.  Fun without being goofy, shocking, or weird.",

The pattern and colors are spot on. Its not terribly sheer but wear a nude bra with it is a must. I put on an undershirt because i dont like to leave anything to chance.  There is NO stretch at all. Its very boxy and not very well fitted. I sized based on my waist measurement and got the size that was just a hair ( talking 1 cm) over my waist size because I was worried there would be little to no stretch and under wouldent work. Well it was huge. About 2-3 inches too big. I even double checked my measurements and the shirt measurements ( on the listing) to be sure after I got it in. I would have had to sew in several inches on the sides to make this shirt work. A button had fallen off in transit and was in the bag as well.  The shirt was well packaged with tissue paper and looked great. However due to the size issue and no stretch I decided to return it. I was really bummed because this is such a pretty shirt and I had some really great outfits planned but without some stretch I dont feel like its flattering on me even if I sized down. My body shape isnt very forgiving with no stretch.  Its very very pretty. I would recommend sizing down or be ready to exchange.,5

It's smaller than the size chart indicates with no stretch in that area around the back- the buttons pull and it gives me gaposis from about an inch under my bust down my stomach, and my love handles are just OUT THERE, encased in cherry-print fabric like sausages. Thus, the two I purchased are being returned.
