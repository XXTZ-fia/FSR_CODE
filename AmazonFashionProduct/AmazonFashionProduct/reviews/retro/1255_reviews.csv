Samanthia Biggers Khari,Great sound!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R219Y9TX9BM0JP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMZZCLSQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",,,Very surprised at how clear the sound is on this little thing. Easy to set up and start using. It clips on and plays loud enough for people around you to hear. Great price and gift idea.,
JayDubzFL,I've tried 3 of this type of speaker - this is the best sounding I've found,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ63T0KRIWE96/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMZZCLSQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",,,"It costs a little more - there's a reason - because it's a better speaker! Sound coming out of this little guy is great! Has a fantastic range, low to high, and the battery life lasts all day while I'm working. It is a little heavier than other speakers of it's type, and honestly I wish it were something other than white, but I didn't get it for looks, I got it for sound, and it has a LOT of it!",
R J,Nice little Speaker,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37PF89LBJ77S9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMZZCLSQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",,,"I ordered this Divoom Itour-S Portable Mini Wearable Bluetooth Speaker because I'm trying to keep more music in my life lately and I needed a more convenient and accessible utility to help make that happen. Somehow I keep finding myself in these ""music slumps"" where I'm forgetting how much I enjoy music and get so busy I don't listen enough. So the well known brand of speaker I am using right now seems to cut out a lot and even though they are known for high quality sound, I have not been all that impressed which has been unfortunate as that was a gift.  This one does have good sound for such a tiny size and it does the job. It is easy to use and I really like that you can hook it just about anywhere, not something I could do with the other one which basically had to just sit on a hard surface. The hard case is amazing. The cuteness factor is pretty high too. I have not tested whether or not the waterproof claim holds but this company is very well reviewed so I have faith that it will.  So I'm looking forward to listening to a lot of music with this quality little speaker. I'm pretty impressed so far at the very low price it just dropped to, 40% off, so far I'm inclined to believe this is a pretty good deal for what you get with this little speaker . Thank you.",
Amani F,Works great,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RY34DQRK8DLFI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMZZCLSQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",,,works reallt well and the souind is amazing. set up via bluetooth is easy,

hjh,My husband loves this,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DT0REBUSSRH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMZZCLSQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",,,He wears it at work. Its easier than clipping his big ol iphone to his belt. Its loud and sound pretty good. It connects super simple. Pretty good deal for the money.,
Crazy Cat Momma,Impressive lil speaker,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPJ4URZFTM7VS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMZZCLSQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2025",,,"This gem is a must have!  It only has 3 buttons but you can do a lot; you can easily switch from one song to the next or play the previous song again, you can even pause it by pressing the middle button.  I’m really shocked that it water proof due to the sides; at 1st I thought you controlled it by pushing the right/left side of it but they’re more like little mini subwoofers. You control sound/song with the - & + buttons. The clip is strong and the sound is solid, can’t really tell by the video but it’s pretty loud for the size.  Easily connects to any device.  I liked it so much, I got a 2nd one 🙃. This won’t disappoint 👍🏼",2
