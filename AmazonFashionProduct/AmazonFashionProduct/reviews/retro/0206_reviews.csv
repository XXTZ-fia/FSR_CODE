Unfortunately the pretty picture was just that, a picture. Literally ruined a special day. It took 4 hours to steam out the wrinkles. While steaming the wrinkles, discovered a line of dirty black spots on the sides and back of the skirt. Several places where the bobbin thread was in a tangle with the top thread. Spent two hours untangling & securing, clipping loose threads. Fabric is not a clean ivory, it has a dingy yellow cast. The fabric feels line rubber gloves. The bodice pulls like it was cut off grain. The black (zipper should have been white); zipper was turned in a manner that makes it bulky,and since it is black, it shows thru the skirt. As it can be seen in the pictures, the hem was not eased in, it is clumping, the black bias tape end is to long, and bunched up and has a poor seam match up. I really expected a quality product, not what I received, I am not happy at all. Spent hours racing around to select a replacement when the wedding was the next day.  .",6

I ordered a large and let me tell ya it fits PERFECTLY. It has breathing room. Girls aren’t smashed. I don’t feel like the zipper (tad bit touchy while zipping) is going to burst when I breathe. The fabric is a good quality and all the seams are sewn correctly. Of all the vintage dresses I have this one is by far superior with the quality. Anyone who frequents these types of dresses knows that it’s hit or miss. No in between. Sometimes seams will be lopsided or sometimes completely missing even. NOTE: if you want the dress to present on yourself as it does with me when it comes to the bottom of the dress you will need a petticoat. Mine is a 3 layer petticoat.,
