It's really a delightful style. I needed it as a costume in a period play.  PROS: looks like photo, attractive retro style  CONS: material is a bit stiff (but washing may soften it)",

Abby,So many compliments on this dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33X7AY88UMKPK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49ZPQCN,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 16, 2024",,,"This dress is a great value for the price. It is good quality and the material is thick enough hold its shape. It is not see through at all which was my worry since the style I purchased is mostly white. I am 5’2, 155 lbs in a size medium. I have a large chest (DDD), the cut of this dress gives them the right amount of space while still fitting my body well and maintaining modesty.",
CityGirl,Cute dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26LNNUKPHKB32/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49ZPQCN,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 27, 2024",Size: SmallColor: White-lemon Floral,Verified Purchase,I bought this for a lemon-themed bridal shower. It’s comfortable and inexpensive so served it’s purpose but it’s not a breathable fabric so it was very hot at this summer daytime event.,
Katie,Cute! Size down for a fitted look.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CY34TWMZOOM7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49ZPQCN,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 24, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I ordered based on the sizing chart and keep in mind that this is a thick stretchy poly fabric. Think really nice vintage polyester. My dress ended up being too big because I didn't take into account for the forgiving stretch. For reference, I am 5'6"" 200lbs 46"" bust, 38"" waist, typically a size 16, and ordered an XXL based on measurements. I needed to size down to at least an XL as the dress kept sliding around and wasn't as fitted as I would have liked. The cut is modest, I could easily wear this to the office, and the length hit just below the knee. The sleeves were comfortable and the zipper was easy to close. Everything about this dress is lovely, especially the strawberry pattern! I want them all!",4

LaylaKilmister,Great dress but why a poor quality zipper?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R243VZFPNRZI0D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49ZPQCN,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 7, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I own multiple Belle Poque dresses and I love them because they are cute, comfortable and affordable. But what I don't love is how delicate the zippers are on their dresses. Belle Poque use better quality zippers. I feel like the zippers will break easily or get caught easily. This dress had a VERY POOR zipper so unfortunately I'm sending this dress back, which is a shame because this dress looked very cute.",
LSauce,Super See-through,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RB5KG0D11ZCAM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49ZPQCN,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 2, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"The dress style was pretty cute, but the fabric is very see-through. I didn’t realize how transparent it could be through the strawberry print, but the fabric is very thin. Feels fine, just thin enough to see through so I would recommend a slip underneath. I returned it instead.",

Except one thing. The bust is a bit big for a “medium”. Either it’s too big or it’s super low. I’m constantly adjusting, pulling it back down to keep it from riding up and bunching at the bust. I’m a 32C (teardrop) so I’m not a tiny busted chick. Other than that it’s a gorgeous dress, beautiful color and pattern. I feel like I’ve stepped out of the past in it. Everyone loves it. I’m 5’8”, 165 lbs, very athletic build. Waste 28ish inches, hips 42, I have wider shoulders, the medium fit well. Originally bought a large but it was too big.",2

I am 5’10” and about 180 pounds with size 36DD chest. The top gives me a wonderful empire waist line and the length is just to my knees. It doesn’t give me back or boob fat, very smooth under arms. The fabric is high quality and doesn’t show dark underwear shades through the fabric (I checked to make sure panty colors don’t peek through). I’m getting another pattern!",
