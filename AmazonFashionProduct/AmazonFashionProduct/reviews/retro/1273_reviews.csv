I am not rough on sunglasses but as far as I can tell they hold up pretty well. They fit great and the packaging was above average. When wearing the sunglasses I feel like a guy from the 70s, almost a Dazed and Confused era vibe.",

They are very flat across the front but they are, indeed, dark enough to block out the sun. I also like that the lenses are large so they have a lot of coverage. My eyes are rather sensitive to bright light and these help block it well.",

They're a bit larger than expected, but they offer a fun retro style and a unique look that I find chic and interesting in its own way. Three faux-gold bar strips add a bit of detail to the arms. Unfortunately, the arms are really stiff so they're not easy to close or reopen when taking them off or putting them back on. Each time I remove them I worry the arms will break when I try to fold them down. The hardware is a metal hinge with a screw and it looks durable, but I worry how long the plastic will last under this kind of pressure.  A cleaning cloth and a cloth bag for storage are included along with brief instructions for care.  If you love the style and color these are worth grabbing; however, if you're looking for a nice pair of polarized glasses with good coverage for everyday use, I'd pass and find something that's not so stiff.",2

dg27,Great low-cost polarized sunglasses,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLC2WJV6Z6L3C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C5LRYPFX,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 21, 2023",Color: Olive Green/Brown,,"My wife and I each own many pairs of sunglasses, including some very pricey name brands. Many of those are nice, but sometimes the cost doesn't seem justified, especially for an item that can be fairly easy to lose or break.  My wife owns several pairs of SOJOS and likes them very much, including this pair. She has problems with many expensive sunglasses falling off her head. She has never had an issue with any of her SOJOS, and this pair is no exception. On this pair the hinges are tighter than they often are: This is a plus, which helps keep them from falling off.  These indeed have a very retro 70s look, especially with the subtle gradient tint. And the lenses are large enough to ensure complete coverage, even in bright sunlight.  A major plus is that they're polarized: There are many sunglasses out there marketed as providing ""UV protection,"" but which are not polarized. All SOJOS come with a little card: When you view the card with polarized lenses, you can read the logo. If you view it with lenses that aren't polarized, the logo isn't visible.  If you're interested in low-cost sunglasses that are polarized, these are a great choice: Highly recommended.",2

It's nice to give something different a try from my normal sunglasses (in terms of colors and shapes). This is a fun take on the vintage aspect-I chose the blue to work with my vermillion colored shirt and dress. I like that they come with a soft storage bag, cleansing cloth, and instructions for care. And they're unisex so my husband can give them a try. Definitely recommend them.",
