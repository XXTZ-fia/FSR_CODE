The sizing was way off. It didn't even come close to being able to button. It was like putting on a medium. I re-ordered a 2x and a 3x, we shall see which one fits.  Update: I ordered a 2x and a 3x because based on how the XL fit, I doubted the 2x would fit. However, there is a big difference between each size, so the 2x fit (actually, a little loose) and the 3x was way too big.  Also, one of the shirts I ordered wasn't in original manufacturer packaging like the others and I could definitely tell by that fact and the strong scent of B.O. that it had been worn before. Good lord, people. If you're going to wear something and return it, at least wash it first. Amazon is not going to wash it. They're gonna put it in a plastic bag and send it to the next person that orders. I try to be mindful of the next person who is going to get an item that I am returning.",

I’m 5’9’’ and weight about 170 pounds with a 36 B chest. The XL is a bit loose around the waist on me, so someone of similar size may be able to size down to a L for a more form fitting top, but may lose some length. I find that the XL gives me enough length to tuck the shirt in which is my preference.  The fabric is light and has a nice feel, not cheap or flimsy feeling, but seems like it may wrinkle a little easily. Doesn’t seem too sheer. Can’t complain about the quality.
