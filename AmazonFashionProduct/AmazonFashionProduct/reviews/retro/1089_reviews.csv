It's thin and light but has the texture of a Halloween costume. It feels like this dress will fall apart if I'm too rough for it. I got it to dress as Alice from Alice in Wonderland and the color is pretty but if you're not an hourglass body type this dress may be very squared in the chest area. I don't think this dress is worth this price. I'd expect something like this to be in the $15-$20 range. If you're willing to make some sacrifices to buy a cheaper dress, this would be alright but there are certainly dresses that fit better. Wearing a petticoat with it is almost essential to get the shape to really show. But boxy in the chest area and I'd say it runs true to size (I'm 145 lbs and 5'3"") it's a good dress if you don't plan to wear it often.",4

The length of it is basically a miniskirt. I am middle aged, too old for such a short dress. This dress makes me look like I'm off my rocker hahaha. I'm giving it 2 stars because I might wear it someday. Also it probably won't be so short on normal size ladies who are reading this. (I'm 6 ft tall and this is a 2X.) It's also very scratchy and uncomfortable polyester. I would return it but that's such a pita. Update: Changed it to 1 star when my partner saw it tonight.

The measurement guide indicated the same. However, it was FAR too small. I'm not a tiny person but my measurement ratios (should to waist, waist to knee, etc)  are in line with a standard mannequin. The waist was too high for this period of dress and the length too short. It's just a polyester dress - rather cheap - but I expected that for the cost. If you look closely at the models in the advertising the waist is too high for them too. It's almost empire. If you have a bust at ALL you may find this dress difficult to button. The proportions seemed more appropriate for a junior size. If you are petite, this may well work very well for you. I lived in Japan for 3 years and this felt like a ""Japanese"" large. I couldn't buy clothes over there. This could work well for a 1940's themed party or swing dancing. I gave it 4 stars because of the waist and length proportions. Doesn't seem fair to trash it completely because of the cheap fabric or the fit. I always expect inexpensive clothes to not fit well but it was cute enough that I was willing to give it a try.
