I have several polos, but none with a button front, relatively heavy knit fabric and short sleeves.  It is certainly different but I like it.The shirt is made to be worn untucked.  There are nice finished hems at the bottom and on the sleeves.  The fabric is stretchy and clings to the torso.  It's designed for slimmer builds.  I normally wear a medium but ordered this shirt in large.  I'm glad I did.  The shoulders fit well and it's not too snug; maybe just a tad long.The pattern is unusual too and I think retro cool.  The manufacturer says 70's vintage but I think the throwback is more like the 40's or 50's.  This shirt should wear well in early spring and late summer.  The material is probably too heavy for hot July days.",
