Color: Jacksboro.  However, like so many jeans today, these are not 100% cotton. They are 99% cotton, 1% elastane. I purposely do not buy stretch jeans, as they stretch out, and do not wear as well. Absolutely an inferior product to 100% cotton.Side note,  why bother stating these jeans are either  Made in USA or Imported.  That tells the buyer nothing.  These were actually made in Bangladesh. Please give accurate descriptions.I won’t be buying Wrangler again.",

The color had an almost green undertone, the zipper hem was lime green, the pockets black, and the rear pocket logos looked awesome. They draped nicely over a thin build. I was suspicious of the thin fabric from the beginning, though. Thought, well they are Wrangler, a brand I always found to be rugged 5 or 10 year jeans. I remember getting low to pick up a tool and heard a tear. I couldn't pinpoint where. Considered it was just them getting worn in. One day, I was putting a receipt in my back pocket and heard a loud rip. That's right, a gentle placing a piece of paper in my pocket ripped the jeans. I am a slender fellow so it's not like my body was stressing out these jeans. It is too bad, as the design is the coolest. I checked on Amazon, and sure enough i3ts the same design flaw people are reporting and apparently it's a huge one...""rip resistance"". Saw pictures of the same buttons ripping in the back. I even noticed the material back there thinned out to almost paper towel levels of thickness from, I guess, sitting down? Why Wrangler?! These jeans were one of a kind unique and awesome, and you used the cheapest material ever? I would have paid $20 more for true wrangler ruggedness with this sweet design!! Boo!",

They will develop holes in the exact same place. As expected, they're imported from Asia. The quality is absolutely atrocious even for that. Right off the bat, one of the five pairs I ordered was completely smaller than the others despite being labeled the same. After a few months (1-2 maybe) they developed tears in the upper inside corner of the back pockets (usually the right) where the metal attaches it to the jeans. They also developed tears where the back left belt loop attaches to the jeans.  I reached out to customer service a bit past the 1 year warranty date once the fourth pair of jeans developed it's second tear, and I was told there was nothing the could do. I'm just left with torn defective pants that were extremely overpriced. Bottoming, do not buy from this absolute joke of a company. They completely lost any quality they had from their history as an American company.",

Now I’m a lot less confident about wearing these pants as I feel they could rip open at any time for no reason.  Love the availability of tall sizes, and color options. Hopefully the torn pair is a fluke. I have cheap Costco pants that have endured years of abuse as landscaping work pants but these Wranglers haven’t even been challenged yet.  Edit : I bought these thinking I was finally buying some tough AND good looking jeans, but they are not tough. I wore them to work a couple times and ripped the knee already. My other pants have endured 100x the same abuse. The wranglers are nice for fashion, but are not durable.",

I normally wear size 32 x 32 in any pants. It has been an ordeal getting the right fit with these jeans because the waist is stretchy.  32 waist for these was way too loose. I am SLIM, not a guy who has a pot belly or someone who likes to wear their pants like a gansta falling off them or the “plumber showing the crack”. I sent back the 32 x 32 pair and ordered 31 x 32. Even that is loose - a belt is required.  Know this before you order and that, like me, you’ll be continually pulling up these jeans if you don’t wear a belt.  Moral of the story I guess is if you want to be sure of what you’re buying go to a store and try on the jeans. I’m wondering why Wrangler named these “retro”.  I don’t remember jeans back in the day having a stretchy waist. Update: I did an exchange - 31 waist arrived and still a full inch too big.  Something wrong here.  Wrangler needs to do better quality control!  Amazon you may forward this to Wrangler.",

These are my favorite go-to jeans period, Wrangler Retro Slim Straight. However, I have had 4 pairs split on me. I have never in my 50+ years had a pair of jeans split on my other than wearing through the knww.  The rear pocket rivets at the upper inside corner have some sort of design issue.  I reached out to Wrangle and sent them photos of two pairs ripped at the same rivet. I am slender, not overweight. I do not do labor work in these jeans. Wranger only replied with a return authorization. I had to pack them up and ship them to Wranger to be evaluated. Then they would determine if they would replace. The did replace them, but when I tried to communicate with them, they only wanted to solve the probllem by replacing them. They seemed to have zero interest in the fact that the issue was the same on multiple pairs and that I even showed them where many online complaints were of the exact same issue of jeans ripping from the upper inside picket rivet.  So Wrangler seems to care nothing about fixing the problem so that I can feel confident in purchasing these again in the future. That is what I want...fixe the problem so I can keep buying my favorite jeans.  By the way....one of the pairs Wrangler sent me as a replacement, failed even quicker, less than 2 months, in the exact same place.  So how can I keep buying these???...I cannot until Wrangler proves to me they fixed the problem and are not just willing to replace after I ship them for evaluation at my own expense and time.",

I have one pair that I only wear for going out on casual event; nothing stressful.  They seen fine for that.  However, I bought a pair a few weeks ago and wore them to work, big mistake.  I work in a warehouse that requires a lot of bending, stooping, climbing, and carrying heavy stuff.  I normally wear the Wrangler Authentics because of the price and how badly I beat them up.  But Amazon had this item on sale, close to what the Authentics are priced so I bought them thinking they were a better quality product.  I wore them twice…twice and the right rear pocket, right at the brad, like some others have posted here, ripped about two inches.  So into the bin they went.Now I don’t know what is going on at Wragler.  I’ve noticed that while their prices are remaining somewhat consistent, their pockets and zipper have shrunk.  My hand barely fits in them and my Pro-Max phone sticks out and is uncomfortable to carry.  And I’m not going to discuss the torture the front zipper presents at certain times.  However, on their Authentics, the pockets are deep and the zippers are sufficiently accommodating.BUYER BEWARE! Do not buy these jeans if you plan on doing any cowboy…stuff or anything remotely close it it.  These are not the jeans for that.  Believe me, you will regret it.",12

SHAYNE J BENOIT,Horrible quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27KNHL0NSKIEA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5MSC5T2,"1.0 "," the United States "," July 23, 2024",Size: 38W x 34LColor: Bozeman,Verified Purchase,"I’m responding to express my disappointment in my Wrangler Retro jeans.  While they fit great and are extremely comfortable, they are the most horrible quality I’ve ever seen in jeans.  The rivets tear through the material on the back pockets and back pockets wear out and tear through the seat of the jeans after only a couple of wears and washings.  I have owned about 6 pair and every single one does the exact same thing.  I will not buy them again and will not recommend them.  It’s unfortunate that such nice looking jeans are so horribly made.",2

Very nice!",
