Most pedestal fans oscillate, but we needed a fan that would  run a straight line.  We obviously paid top dollar for this excellent machine, and it is worth every penny.  I am more than old enough to remember when the ""Voranado"" line was the house brand for the ""Two Guys from Harrison"" department stores.  Buy the way, in the New York City /New Jersey area, ""Voranado"" is pronounced ""Voron-nah do.We love the retro look.  May have to drill a hole in the base to secure the bottom a bit better.",

This white big old tacky thing is tragic and has got to go. There it was, and it definitely has got a retro art look to it. I like that it's metal, has a solid and smooth feel to it as well as a rounded case. It's like it was really built when they were focused not just on what the fan can do but what it looks like as well. BUT the fan itself also works wonderful and is quiet. The air really does move along better too. This brand has been around forever and they seem still focused on quality and design!! Thanks for designing not just a fan but one that's got a cool vibe design to it.",

Fun fact: Apparently, about 34.3% of adults use a fan for that sweet, sweet background noise that helps them drift off to dreamland (thanks, Sleep Doctor survey!). So naturally, I figured this fan would be our ticket to peaceful sleep. Spoiler: It’s not quite loud enough to drown out the urban lullaby of honking cars and sirens outside. Sure, it pushes air around and looks fabulous doing it, but if you’re looking for serious white noise, you might still need the good ol' box fan.  Bottom line: Five stars for style, three stars for sleep aid.",

About the smaller one, and after realizing how powerful that was, I decided to invest in the larger one because it made sense. This is one of the best quality vans I think that you could possibly get. In all honesty they just don’t make things with this quality material anymore. There are three speed settings, and the tilt ability is also really good. The best thing about it is the fan power and because of the quality of the materials that they use, it worked so well that I didn’t have to buy an air conditioner. I was able to use the air conditioner that I had and use this fan to help because of the fan power. To me, it felt crazy to spend this much money on a van, especially considering you could get an air conditioner for almost this price, but again the quality of this item is worth the investment. I am very satisfied with this, and I definitely recommend it to anybody who is looking into getting one.",

I replaced the fuse and capacitor, made sure the switch was good, but motor doesn't turn. The company won't replace the motor and since I don't want to toss the whole fan in the garbage to replace it with another short-living one at the reduced cost they offered, I'm stuck. I'm looking around for some sort of motor replacement but so far I'm out of luck. The second one I'd purchased rattles on one of the speed settings, which indicates another motor problem, which I won't be able to replace when it craps out.

They work very well and keep the air circulating throughout each room and keep them cooler as right now I’m using them in the summer. They are also very pretty being all metal. I got a lot of compliments on them. Basically just pull them out of the box and plug them in  jr size and they don’t take out much space on the table top. They are a good size and I keep mine on the highest speed because I like the air circulating.,
