As-shipped, it had very clear fold lines that didn't fall out after hanging. After washing and drying, and taking it out immediately while still a little damp and hanging it, it still ended up wrinkled and needed ironing to be wearable.

I’m not really a fan of polyester clothing but it is great to layer on top of a simple white tee.  The material is very breathable, maybe too breathable.

The fit is pretty good, and the look of the shirt is attractive. However, the blue color is a bit washed out. Looking at the options, some of the other colors are more vibrant and probably a better pick.  Though I like the look of the shirt, the material is rather thin. It's nice for breathability and coolness but it's thin enough to really need a t-shirt under it.",
Suzanne,"Great vintage styling, looks like a 50s or early 60s bowling shirt.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2611Z0JV746RE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4788SYZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 2, 2024",,,"I ordered this Hardaddy Men's Vintage Bowling Shirt Short Sleeve Button Down Hawaiian Summer Beach Casual Shirt for my husband. He enjoys vintage styling, and liked the bowling shirt feel of this shirt.  This shirt is made of a manmade fabric, it is 95% polyester and 5% spandex. My husband said the fabric felt soft, kind of like rayon.  I ordered the shirt in a size M. My husband usually wears a size 44 jacket. The size chart for this shirt says a size M has a chest measurement of about 47”. The smallest size available was a M, so that’s what I ordered him.  The shirt actually fit him nicely. I expected it to be quite loose, but the shirt fit well.  My husband found the shirt lightweight and comfortable, he said the fabric was soft and felt cool for summer. His favorite color is green, so I ordered him the green shirt. The green is a saturated, middle green color. The front of the shirt has stripes in white and black, they show up well against the green.  There are six white buttons on the front of the shirt, there is also one breast pocket. My husband liked the bowling shirt style. He thought the shirt was very evocative of the late 1950s and early 1960s.  This looked nice with khakis, it also looked good with a pair of jeans.",
