There is also a diamond pattern knit into the body. Much classier than I expected! I deliberately ordered it too big because I did not want a cropped tight fit. I typically wear a medium and a medium would have given me the tighter cropped fit. I ordered again in different colors…can’t wait to get the black cherry one with red contrast stitching, (I hope It holds Up without pilling)",
