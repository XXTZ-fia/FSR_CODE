DO NOT purchase bc if you do not like the items than you will not see your money back. I’ve never had issues returning something on Amazon. This is terrible customer service.,

Robert D. P. Mackie,Important sizing info,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10CIK36IQWXKZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3JCLBW6,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 3, 2022",Size: LargeColor: Blue Denim,Verified Purchase,"There are two reasons why sizing reviews are all over the place. 1. Some guys who are 5'10"" and 210lbs are fat. Some guys who are 5'10"" and 210lbs are shredded with clearly defined abs. 2. Some guys, usually the fat ones, prefer their clothing to be baggy. Other guys, usually the lean ones, want their clothing fit to be more tailored.  I am 5'10"" 210lbs shredded with clearly cut abs, and bowling ball delts, and a Large fits almost perfectly with plenty of room around the mid-section. The sleeves seem a tad longer than tailored, but for off-the-shelf, this shirt fits me very well. I have full range of motion, and room, while not being overly baggy.  If you're 5'10"", fat, and like baggy clothes,, you may want an XL.",12
