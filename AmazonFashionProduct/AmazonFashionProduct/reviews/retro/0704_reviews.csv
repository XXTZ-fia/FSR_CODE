The fabric is wonderfully flowing, making it super comfortable to wear. What really stands out are the vibrant colors—they pop beautifully and add a cheerful touch to any outfit.  To take it a step further, I decided to turn this shirt into a fun DIY dyeing project and made a stylish slit in it. This added a personal flair and made the crafting experience even more enjoyable.  If you're looking for a versatile piece that combines style and comfort, this boho shirt is a fantastic choice. Whether you wear it as is or customize it like I did, it's sure to be a standout piece that you’ll love to show!!",

But my main complaint is the fabric. There are some polyesters that are soft and comfortable, even airy. The fabric of this skirt felt oddly stiff, like some kind of slightly scratchy plastic. It didn't breathe, meaning that on a very warm evening, it makes you even warmer. Too bad, since I got it for summer use (beach cover up) with sandals. It might be okay for fall/winter wear, though, with something between it and skin, like with boots, leggings and a sweater.",

Has a slip that goes partway down, approximately to the knees, so not see-through. Super comfortable. waistband is not too tight. So perfect for travel because I can squish them into a suitcase and they come out looking great!!!!!! I am 5’7”, 133 pounds. I’m sure I purchased a medium because I am a medium and pretty much everything. The skirts fall to my ankle, just barely above the lump on the outside of your foot. So I am attentive to walking so I don’t trip. So far quality is great. The fabric is thin so a little delicate but I haven’t had any tears yet.",9

Now I will say, the skirt itself is very pretty. It is a good length, vibrant in color, and has actual, decently-sized pockets. It flows well enough (though it isn't winning any medals in that department). From a distance, it seems nice. Not amazing. But nice. And that's where my compliments end.  My biggest problem, honestly, is the fabric. It is 100% polyester, but it feels plasticky. Like, it's not exactly the material windbreakers are typically made of, but it's close enough that it was the first comparison I thought of when touching the skirt. It's not super breathable, and it does not feel great on bare skin. This latter point is especially important because the skirt has *no lining at all.* Now, that isn't as big of an issue in terms of the fabric being translucent, because the weird fabric is so thick that it saves the skirt from being totslly see-through, but it is definitely a downside in that the uncomfortable polyester thus has to rest directly against your legs.  Overall, it just feels... cheap. I'll probably keep it and wear it because of the cute pattern and pockets, and because I'm so very lazy when it comes to returning things, but if I could stop my past self from having spent money on it, I absolutely would have.",14
