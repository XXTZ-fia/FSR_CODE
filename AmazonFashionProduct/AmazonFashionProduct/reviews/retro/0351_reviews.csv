The people who claim they are expensive feeling and durable are lying. The frames are plastic and the lenses are even lighter plastic. I was given these as a gift one day ago, and a lense already fell out. I’ve worn them once. Also, I’m not sure what they use to make these “polarized,” but they are very disorienting when worn. They come with a card to “prove” they are polarized, but instead of cutting glare from the sun, I am seeing lines of rainbows and solar flares throughout. I’m used to expensive polarized glasses such as ray-ban, which do not do this. These glasses make me dizzy and give me a headache and nausea because of the effect the “polarization” has on the plastic lenses. I do not recommend these.",
