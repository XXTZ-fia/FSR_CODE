Amazon Customer,Didn't last,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IPIN5ZY7OAVI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0925SKWJV,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 9, 2023",Color: Zebra + Blue,Verified Purchase,"I've had these for a few years, and i really liked them at first, but unfortunately they don't hold up in the long term. For context, I take very good care of my things. With these, I never dropped them or mishandled them, and always put them back into the soft sleeve included as to not leave them exposed to the sunlight for long periods.  Some pros are: Comfortable fit with soft coating on the plastic The arms are sturdy and never wiggled or came loose. The lenses are great to see through, and provide great eye protection. Good customer service.  Now the cons...  The first problem that arose was the soft coating on the plastic frame started to peel pretty early, especially where the frame touches the face. I emailed the company, and they sent me another pair without question. I applaud the customer service, and the next pair did hold up better. However, I also moved from a more humid climate to a drier one, so this might have something to do with it.  The new pair I received held up for some time, but one day when I was applying a conservative amount of pressure to clean the lenses with the cloth included, the frame snapped right above the right eye. I figured I may have just been too vigorous in my cleaning, so didn't think anything of it. I switched back to using the old pair that was peeling, and one day while simply adjusting them on my face, the same fracture happened in the same spot above the right eye. You can see in the pictures provided, the break happened in almost the exact same spot.  Although I never dropped them, the lenses did present a few scratches just from regular cleaning. I can't say they are weak, but also can't say that they are durable or scratch resistant either.  Overall, I really wanted to like these sunglasses, but they have some flaws that would prevent me from purchasing them again in the future.",

I've seen the all-wooden sunglasses and those don't really appeal. For some reason, these black plastic fronts with wooden earpieces is perfect. I especially like them with the blue reflective glass and the matte black finish make them look that much more genuine (the shiny black plastic alternative looks a little cheesier).  The back-bending hinges and the bag and cleaner cloth made from recycled material are all pluses. The case is pretty solid too (though it's not solid wood). And it comes with a little double screwdriver. I had a similar pair that my daughter accidentally knocked off into a creek and I cried a little until I found them slightly destroyed. Very happy to have a nice new pair in the collection.",16
