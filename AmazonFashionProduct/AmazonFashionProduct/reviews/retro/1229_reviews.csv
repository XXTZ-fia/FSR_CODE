It comes down to about the middle of my thighs.  I am 5'8"" tall.  It has a pretty high ribbed, round neckline. The sleeves fit off my shoulders.  They are ribbed around the bottom so they hold them up off my hands.  It's a thick knit.  Will be great for cold weather.  I have some fleece lined leggings that will look great with it.
