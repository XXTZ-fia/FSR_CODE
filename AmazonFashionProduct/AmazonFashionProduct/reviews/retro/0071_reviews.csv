SO COMFY!  They fit me so well from the get-go that I got back online and ordered a second right away.  These won't be water proof, and only time will tell about durability, but they look well built, and my other Keens (the ptc oxford and ptc slip ons) last over a year wearing them 40 hrs a week, on my feet, walkin on concrete.  If you wear Keens already, take note of your size -- I went with the same size as my other Keens and wasn't disappointed.  If you DON'T wear Keens, please note that in my experience, Keens run slightly larger and slightly wider (I love Keen's wider foot base).  I got these shoes when they were around $85, a great price for them.  I wouldn't spend over $100 for them, but that's because I wouldn't spend more than that for a sneaker-type shoe  (my other keens run around $120-$150) but who knows, if these hold up (and maybe I'll try them out at work once my old shoes give out) maybe I would!",3

The right side of the right shoe.....there is a seam there that lands right on top of where the end of the metacarpal is at its widest.....and unlike the left foot, the right was painful to the point where after a few hours I took them off and my foot at that spot was bright red. Maybe just unlucky for me, so I contacted KEEN and got, well, the support was worse than the shoe. I just returned them asfter asking KEEN is there something to be done, even a piece of duct tape over the seam? No conversation just a link to their portal to do a return but they did not notice that I was clear that I bougth from amazon and was looking for ADVICE not return instructions.......maybe you will do better than I did, but just a warning in case.

I wanted to get him a better type of shoe that would last him longer. I will say, they seem like they are a little pricier. However, in my opinion, they are worth it. My husband has been wearing them for over two months now for multiple times a week and they are still going strong with plenty of life left in them. I would definitely pay this if it means that I buy shoes less often than I was prior. He states that these are supportive, fit him well, and are some of the comfiest shoes he has owned. We’ve had keens in the past that held up for a long time so these definitely met my expectations of the brand. I was also pleasantly surprised of the modern look of these shoes compared to the usual hiking type of shoes that they are known for.

They are comfortable in a basic kind of way, and based on the make, I think they will be very durable.The fit is a bit narrow, but the length is true to size.  If you run wide, these may not be the best for you.  We have 3 people in the household that are about the same shoe size.

These are very comfortable, and have great grippy soles that are very well cushioned, so walking is quite easy in them. The soles have little circular projections in them, and raising them up like they do makes these good for walking in the rain, as the shoes do not soak up water in that case.The shoes came with standard thin black laces installed but also included a nice set of tubular laces that are black/red/yellow and look very nice on the shoes.  Besides having the rugged raised soles, the soles run along the front and back of the shoes, which gives you more grippyness and keeps the front of the shoes from wearing excessively as some of my sneakers have done.

Definitely felt my foot overhanging on the sides and the insoles didn't quite feel right. Didn't deduct from rating as this doesn't claim to be for wide feet nor did it come in wide sizes.

Although they're presented as stylish/lifestyle shoes, Keen didn't compromise on functionality. They seem to have flawless construction and are made from quality materials, like leather.

The Luftcell footbed provides excellent arch support, and the padded tongue and collar make this all-day wearable. Like my other KEENs, I can wear these for hours without discomfort. The rubber sole offers great grip, and the bruise plate adds protection on uneven surfaces - typical KEEN quality. Fit is true to size, with a good balance of security and toe room. As with all my KEEN shoes, I expect these to last. The leather looks durable, matching the longevity I've experienced with my other pairs. They're slightly heavier than some sneakers, but that's a minor trade-off for the durability KEEN offers. Overall, these sneakers are a great addition to my collection. They blend retro style with the comfort and durability I've come to expect from the brand. These sneakers are a bit on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for. I recommend giving these a try.",
Powder Creek,"Great style, good fit.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R215ONTMXK0M3L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTFQNCNS,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 13, 2024",Size: 13Color: Dark Earth/Black,,"Keen Men’s retro sneakers-These shoes look great and fit great. They are called “retro style” but they just look sensible to me. They have sturdy leather reinforcement, so they should last for a long time. The fit is relatively snug around the mid foot but the toe box is roomy. I like the tread. It's a pattern of circular pegs. After a long hike, they seemed to work exactly as they should. I googled some references to this shoe and some sites are calling them mountain shoes, implying they have some capability for climbing. Really they are intended to be everyday sneakers. I don’t know exactly what that means, but I didn’t have any trouble hiking in them. They have a feature called a bruise plate. I couldn’t find any pictures or further description, but I assume it is some sort of insert in the sole that protects you on rough ground. One feature I like is the finger pull strap on the heel. Far too many shoes come equipped with a weeny little strap that you can barely get your finger in. Not so here. It's a good size and provides a good grip. All things considered, I like these shoes and give them 5 stars.",
