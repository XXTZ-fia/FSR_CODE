So, it is very sheer. It does look nice but it is hard for me to wear because of the sheerness, which makes me uncomfortable. The fabric itself is also the cheap, rough stuff that doesn't feel the greatest. It is also not the longest, so my tall and large body looks, strange, in this. Especially because the buttons stop literally half way down. If you are fit, this shouldn't be as much of a problem.",3

It is well made and has a tiny bit of stretch to it. I love the three buttons at the waistline, which will accentuate a small waist. The way that it flows out underneath the bust gives some grace to any tummy parts that we might want to cover. Having said that, this was not attractive on my body. I have an athletic build and it made my arms look huge. I was disappointed, because I really love the way this shirt looks, but it will not work for me.",

J.

The V-neck is not too revealing, but still has a nice feminine look.  It comes in at the waist right below the breast, then fans out a bit.  The three buttons on the waist add extra style to the blouse.  The material is not really stretchy, but it is thin, making this a great warm-weather top.  I get icky back rolls that often cause a little extra pull from fabric, causing some sleeves to rub against my armpit area in an uncomfortable way, and this blouse did not do that.  I was very happy with this.  The only thing I really disliked about this blouse was the split in the front right above the waist.  I wouldn't mind it if it were a little lower on the blouse.  Occasionally, when sitting, the top would ride up a touch and show my belly.  Not ideal for the office I work in.  I washed and dried the blouse on delicate/low heat and it did come out with wrinkles, which steamed out well.  Decent value for this blouse.  For reference, I ordered a medium and I am 5'4"", 150lbs, 36c/d and 34"" right at my ribcage (since this is where the blouse comes in a bit)",14
Jamie Floyd,I wish this was a tad longer.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KQ77A0B039AS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQP7HS9G,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 19, 2024",,,"Thin material but not cheaply made. Very cute and fit pretty well. I am long wasted, so, this was not the length I prefer yet I still made it work. Honestly a really cute shirt. Its hard to find clothes that fit taller plus sized women lengthwise. I wish they had a longer option in these tops. Super cute just not the length I feel confident wearing.",
Hermione G.,CUTE but thin and scant in the bust,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RP6F08ITBSE3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQP7HS9G,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 15, 2024",,,"This is a CUTE top, but it's not going to work for everybody. I'm a 36DDD and got the XXL. I'm technically between XL and XXL on the chart, but the last thing I got from this company in XL was far too small in the chest, so I went up. It fits the bust comfortably, but it's a bit big in the waist, with no way to address that without tailoring. If I went down a size, the bust would be WAY too small.  Do note that the bottom is entirely open below the buttons, as in there are two flaps that just meet, don't attach to each other. That's not going to be an issue for me, but it's not screamingly clear from the photos.  I got the black dot, and it's pretty see-through. Again, not an issue for me and my well-matched nude bra (NOT WHITE), but you can definitely see the tag on the side through the fabric, as in see the outline and the printing (not readably but as dark splotches) through the fabric. The fabric is also okay but not great. I'm not anti-synthetic and there are some GREAT ones out there. This isn't the greatest, but it's also not the worst, either. It's reasonably soft.",3
