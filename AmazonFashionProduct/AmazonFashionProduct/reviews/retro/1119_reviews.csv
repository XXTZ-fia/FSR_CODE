Many people (beautiful women) looked us directly in the eyes and smiled (they were making passes at us, I know it), and I had to forcefully, but politely, tell them we were booked solid with partners for the next few days. Children screamed (not sure if this was in support or fear, but whatever). We are, literally, sex-gods in this outfit.  These track suits are the best. They were priced right, came quickly (unlike me), fit as-expected, and, if it had been possible to increase our sex appeal, would have absolutely done so. God Bless You, G-Style.
