The craftsmanship itself seems pretty good for a dress of this price—nothing was too lacking, nothing itchy, and I enjoyed wearing it out. The sleeves are especially cute. It was true-to-size for me as well; I had ordered Small and Medium versions (I'm usually a Small or 2-4 in dress size) and the Medium turned out to be too roomy.  The belt that came with it was a simple cloth belt, however... It would slip 'n' slide around a bit much for my liking. As a replacement, I ordered an inexpensive elastic belt with a bow (Meta-U brand on Amazon) like some other people in these reviews, I believe, and it did the job much better with a nice cinch!  Lastly, you will need a petticoat to achieve a fitting 50s silhouette. I got a Medium 24"" GRACE KARIN brand one (also on amazon) on sale for about $12/petticoat. I might get a second petticoat to have an even fluffier shape next time, but I digress.  Overall, I ended up being a huge fan of this dress! Received many compliments for it just strolling around a botanical garden. Definitely considering purchasing another. :)",3

For reference, I am 5'3"" 125 lbs and 36B, and all I can say is that by Chinese garment factory standards, that must be larger than a Medium.(2) The dress does not look half as elegant, half as full in the skirt part than in the picture.

I'm tall, so I was relieved that the dress went over my knees, but the bust and sleeves were very tight. I couldn't raise my hands or move my arms around very much because it was so tight. I was very disappointed. If you're considering buying this dress, I recommend ordering at least two sizes up. It's a real bummer because, again, the dress itself was beautiful, but just too small.
