I had no expectations of these aviators but they are incredible. They are lightweight and so comfortable to wear. I have a big head and these fit.  Polarized lenses are the best for driving and blocking sun glare. These are also perfect for driving because they gently block the sun while not being too dark.  I just ordered a second pair and am considering a few more colors to have at home and in the car.  Zero complaints.,

Nicely enough made and fit fine. Two things to note: the lenses are lightly tinted so these are better for shaded areas or overcast days, depending on your light sensitivity (I personally need darker lenses). Also, at least in my pair, there there is a band of clear plastic at the bottom below each lens (in the frame) that gets bright in sunlight and is pretty distracting. All that said, nothing wrong with them, just things to know.",

The earpieces fit my head well and my head is on the larger side so it may not work so well for those with smaller heads. They have polarized lenses and I can see clearly. They came with a basic little bag and lens cloth. With the lightweight plastic arms, time will only tell how well they will hold up regular use.

Also, because the lenses are not too dark, I can read my watch (I keep track of distance when I walk) with no problems' The only negative, and the reason for 4 stars rather than 5, is that I find the temples a bit too short (maybe 1/4 inch).
