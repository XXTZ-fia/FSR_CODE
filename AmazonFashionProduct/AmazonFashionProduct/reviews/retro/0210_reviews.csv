However, the other piece of clothing was only available an XXL which is only one size larger than this sweater and it was huge so this sweater runs a little small.

First, the cut and the cherries are just adorable, and so fun to add to a work outfit or some skinny jeans. The fit is really flattering-it’s not a piece meant to be worn oversized, so it is about waist length and fitted, like vintage cardigans from the 50’s and 40’s. I love the fabric, it’s light enough for a person who is always hot, like me, yet cozy enough for cooler temps or those frigid offices! The best part is how soft it is! Almost like an angora blend…not itchy at all.  The only part I don’t love is that the cherries are not embroidered, they are sewn on patches…they still look cute though, and are perfectly acceptable for the price of the sweater. The extra soft material makes up for that, too-definitely adds a luxe look and feel. I love to pair my sweater with a blouse that I also purchased from this shop-the short sleeve button up black top with the small white dots…I get so many compliments when I wear them!  While I have not run this through the washer/dryer, I’m not worried about it holding up or fading. I have not noticed any pulls or pilling on it either.  Definitely a winner, and I would recommend this great sweater to anyone considering it!",10

The embroidery is lovely and the fabric super soft. Its more of a peachy pink than pink, so it won't match the baby pink dress I got to wear it with, but its a cute color.  It is a cropped top, so you will feel like its short, fyi, which is flattering to certain figures,  especially an hourglass.  NOTE- these run BIG y'all.  Actually all of Belle Poque tops run big imo. I knew this, but initially got the XL according to the chart. I couldn't wear it. There was so much fabric that it bagged in the back. I returned for a Large, which fits fine but I could probably wear a medium because I like my tops fitted. It bags on the ribs under the breast in a weird way, which I can overlook because its so darn cute. I am 43-34-48 (38D)  and 5'9.I recommend sizing down from the chart recommendations.  You can't tell because my arms are up but it could be more fitted. Its definitely more wide than long.",27
