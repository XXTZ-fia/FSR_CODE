First, I am very sensitive to bright lights, especially blue lights. Where I live, the roads are dark and narrow and deer are everywhere so people tend to put their brights on and either forget they are supposed to turn them off for oncoming cars or they just don’t care. There are also a lot of trucks that have insanely bright lights that can cause me actual pain. That being said, I had low expectations for these glasses, because I didn’t think it could be such a simple solution. I googled “what do people do about bright lights at night while driving?” Several pairs of glasses were suggested. I came here and picked these because of the price. I am so glad that I have these. Tonight I didn’t hate everyone! I didn’t swear one single time! The bright lights are neutralized just enough and the blue lights are a light green hue. My eyes were happy. I drive at night a few times a week so this was much needed. It actually works. It works and they are pretty cute. The frames are light weight. This was a good buy.",47
