deb,"really pretty, but too long",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CALI2SSGLQXL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4J4T44W,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2025",Color: Black CherriesSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I loved this dress, but for a 5'3"" person it came well below the knees which is personally unflattering. I don't have the money to get it altered or I'd definitely keep it. I really need a dress to come TO or RIGHT ABOVE the knees to look good on me. I really do love the stretchiness of the bodice, the zipper is good... I wish it had pockets like the spaghetti strap version (which I actually had MORE problems with). the fabric is lovely. if it fit me right, I'd keep it, but it's just too long for me and I don't have a way to fix that.",
SallyMJ,"Beautiful, graceful leafy dress",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19JYUAR7ZEYA8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4J4T44W,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Color: Green LeafSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"I am happy to say this dress is true to size! — unlike some other retro style dresses on Amazon that run small. This sizing chart has a range of an inch or two couple for the bust, waist, and hips. The dresses that don’t fit as well just have one measurement. It might say 36” for the bust, instead of 36-37.” There’s some forgiveness in the waist.  I wear medium, but bought a medium and a large, because I wasn’t sure of the sizing. The medium fit just right. This dress makes me look as if I have an hourglass figure (I do not!) I just pulled the dress on, didn’t even use the zipper.  Something I really like about the straps is they use a design strategy also in some of my bras. The backs of the straps are angled inward a little bit toward the center of the back — just enough so the straps don’t fall down. Most dresses and bras have the straps even in the front and the back, and the strap can fall down, but if the back is angled inward a bit like this, they can’t fall down. Yay!  The leaf pattern is gorgeous. The smocking in the back helps the dress bodice fit just right, the fabric is beautiful and the length is flattering, fresh and breezy. FYI— I do not have a perfect figure. I have a big rib cage, a tummy, and a few rolls. You can’t tell any of that with this dress design — the waist of the dress is a little higher than my waist, so it skims above the waist — very flattering. It’s made well. There’s a lining, so you don’t need a slip.  To the manufacturer - One thing that would make it better: Please add pockets! I think they would work well with this design.",

BUT, as I was setting into the bodice the right front was cut too shallow on the side and sat below half my bra. No amount of shifting would make it fit. The left side was also shallow but not by as much. The side bodice on both sides puckered where there should have been darts to fit. No smoothing that out. I could have possibly added darts, but I can’t add fabric to an improperly cut/designed bodice. Smaller sizes may fit fine, but this is an example of a small size that was computer designed to simply get bigger with no regard for the a large fit. It’s a shame because otherwise it fit fine and was slamming cute.",

I love Belle Boque dresses. This is the fourth dress in this style I have purchased. All different patterns. This dress, however, runs significantly larger from waist up and the material is different. I am 5'10, normally with small top (36 B). The other dresses fit perfect in XL but this one had about 2 inches of extra fabric up top so had to return for size Large which fit better but still slightly loose in shoulders. Also, the material is different. While the other three dresses (plain black with roses on collar line, strawberry print and rose print) are all a blend of cotton spandex this is 95% Polyester, 5% Elastane. I don't mind, it's still beautiful but just seems a bit lower in quality (this is where I cut a half-star in my rating), and has a sleeker feel, with a slight shine. The skirt is very, very full so plenty of room for a petticoat if you wanted to add. It hits me just below the knee so for those who aren't tall it will likely hit mid-calf. I would recommend this dress. So much fun. I'll be wearing it to a vintage trailer rally that I attend.",

If I wanted another, If it was an inch longer in that bodice area, it wouldn't have been an issue. Height and weight aren't the issue.
