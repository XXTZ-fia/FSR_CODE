J. Augustine,Perfect t-shirt for rock and roll fans....,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SJP7RYW6TZPR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2W2R11L,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 5, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Bk01rkr,,"I'm a fan of classic rock as well as rock and roll so this t-shirt was perfect for my small collection of rock themed tees. The t-shirt is reasonably well made with all seams finished and no obvious loose threads. The fabric is soft, somewhat lightweight, and very comfortable against the skin. The fit is as expected and the size XL was just right for me – neither tight nor baggy. The v-neck is cute, doesn't dip too low, and is great for showing off a necklace or whatever. The text and graphics are colorful, well adhered to the fabric, and do not have that plasticy feel that a lot of recently made t-shirts have had. Washing instructions are mostly printed in laundry symbols and tell you to machine wash cold, drip dry, and low iron. I did machine was on normal settings and opted to lay the t-shirt flat for drying. It did so in a reasonable amount of time, didn't wrinkle, and looked great. I've got a suspicion that with how soft the fabric is I will probably be reaching for this t-shirt quite often....",5

It is lightweight, soft and comfy.  It goes down to about the middle of your back jeans pockets.  The sleeves have a little fold at the end and with the v-cut neckline, it makes a normal t-shirt a little more classy.  All I did is wash it in the washing machine and dry it on a medium setting and hung it up in the closet.  It came out looking just as nice as it did new.  Looks and feels good at a reasonable price.  I recommend this shirt.",2

It’s sewn well and the colors are nice. It would fit well if I had ordered the correct size. I need one size up because I like my tops loose and this one is clingy. I’ll still wear it but I’ll put a shirt over it because I’m sensitive about my tummy roll. When I looked at the decal I was curious about the number of strings on the guitar so I looked it up. There are some guitars that do have 8 strings so I’m okay with that, but all 8 strings on the decal don’t extend all the way to the top and that bugs me. I’ll still wear it and hopefully nobody will notice.",4
