I saw so many folks commenting on the comfort, and I'm just curious if I just have sensitive feet, or what. I purchased a pair of these black & white pumps to match a dress I had for a viewing/funeral mass... so I was not walking much at all, and standing time was not crazy or anything... but man were my feet killing me. Super disappointing because while the price point is not bad, not sure if it's worth one time of use. I imagine I'd find more comfort with some cushiony insoles, but these are very true to size, and I'd expect to run into trouble with tightness if I were to try a good insole. Other than that, the shoes are darling and reminded me of the saddle shoes I used to wear as a really little kid. Overall, I give it a ""meh."" I love these shoes, but I'm really afraid to wear them again!",2

I bought an 8 to have more room since your feet move forward in heels (normally wear a 7.5). They “fit” but were so tight in the toe area I knew I couldn’t wear them for very long. So I returned and got an 8.5. They’re a bit too big but decided to keep them anyways because I love them so much. The 2 stars are strictly for how cute they are. I don’t understand how an 8 was so tight but a 8.5 is too big. Like a size too big. I feel like one of them has to have been marked wrong or the sizes are just inconsistent because the size difference between the 2 was more than a half size for sure. I will probably never wear these shoes but I knew I couldn’t live without them unfortunately.,
