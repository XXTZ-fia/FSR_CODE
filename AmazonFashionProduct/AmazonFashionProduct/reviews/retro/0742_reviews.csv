The fabric is a vibrant red with bright white dots.  An important point to consider is that it is definitely proportioned for a woman with a short torso.  The bust is padded and the design at the legs is flattering, not high cut.",

I'm 5'9"" 210lbs, 45 bust, 40 waist, and 46 hips. It fits perfectly everywhere but my bust. Now, don't get me wrong, I know you can tighten it around your neck to get better support. Thats not my problem. My bra size is a 38G so I have a small band size compared to my cup size. This is a common problem and I usually end up just dealing with it or finding some way to make the ""band"" smaller, ie. a safety pin on either side. I'm definitely buying again and keeping this one but I think I'll try sizing down to see if that helps. Otherwise it fits perfectly but I don't feel any compression in the stomach area so keep that in mind.",

It definitely does!!! I should have bought an XL instead of the L, even though I usually wear a medium. The suit doesn’t fully fit around my booty and the halter feels tight around my neck.

Love the bright, cheery yellow, the classic ""bathing beauty"" styling, and the fit.  Leg openings are a little higher than I have been selecting, but it's okay.  True to size (14 in my case).  First time in years that I have not dreaded wearing a bathing suit - that is high praise indeed!  My concern going in was that the halter tie would loosen in the water while dancing to Oldies, but no!  I tied a double knot instead of a bow and The Girls were secure.  The built-in bra support is so much better than other suits - a welcome change.
