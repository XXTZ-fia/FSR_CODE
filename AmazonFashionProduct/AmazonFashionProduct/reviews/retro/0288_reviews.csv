It's happened to me twice already and it won't happen again. These cost a tiny fraction of what I've been spending and they work absolutely great over my regular prescription glasses and that' how I've been wearing them!  I originally ordered them to use as Janis Joplin Pearl-type glasses for dressing up (as the hippie I used to be) for a costume party. I ordered 3 different colors figuring that I'd return 1 or 2 but I liked them so much that I'm keeping all 3 and am using them regularly over my glasses and have even gotten compliments on them! My prescription glasses are wire rimmed and lightweight so these fit over them easily and it's not all that noticeable that I'm wearing 2 pairs - and if it is, I don't care because it's not worth the $500+ it would cost to replace the prescription shades I lost. These are keepers and not only are they comfortable but they're flattering because they balance out my somewhat oblong face. I love them!",3
