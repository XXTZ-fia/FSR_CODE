I took out a star because the front chest area is a bit off with the padding, so the fit isn't great.  The back side is shorter than the front.  I wish they would mirror the backside to match the skirted front side.  I still kept it because I had missed the return deadline before trying it on, so I'll try to make it work.

The biggest problem (and it’s BIG) is the inside seam around the top of the bodice. Not only does it project up, it’s substantial and is actually sewn to protrude straight out. It’s rough against the skin and rubs quite a bit just when trying it on, I can only imagine if it was wet!!
