Note: many recruiters have seen this dress a lot in multiple colors, so add some of your own personality to the look. I added a light blue handbag for a pop of color. The material is stretchy and not see through. The attached tie/scarf can be worn down or tied into a bow. The length is perfect for a FA interview.  I also wore this dress all day long, while working my customer experience flight during training. It was very comfortable. I am 5’4” 115 lbs. I ordered a size small.

No se transparenta, pueden usarlo sin temor.Tiene buena calidad y lo recomiendo. Ahora explico por qué no le doy Cinco estrellas, es caluroso, tienes que estar en aire acondicionado para usarlo, porque si vas a estar en algún lugar al aire libre te vas a asar por el calor que da la tela. Se ajusta al cuerpo de tal forma que para retirarlo pasas un poco de trabajo. Yo Mido 5.3 y peso 157 lbs, pedi una talla M y como ven en las fotos me queda bien, pero...con una talla L pienso estaria un poquito más cómoda. Depende de si les gusta ajustado o más suelto.
