Zoey,Mostly decent skirt but VERY cheap material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QD6QN21W30RQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5DCQT5B,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 26, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Small,Verified Purchase,The fit and style of the skirt is cute but the material is so cheap that it detracts from any positive attributes the skirt initially had. It is very similar to a paper thin swimsuit/athletic material and wrinkles almost immediately after being put on. I’m not going to return it but I would never buy it again and I would discourage anyone else from buying it in the future.,

That being said, this skirt fits me so well! It falls a couple inches below the knee, and the way the waist is sewn it sits right where I want it instead of falling to my hips. I do wish the material was a bit thicker, but that is not a deal breaker in this case. It is thick enough and long enough to be appropriate for a workplace setting and not in the least bit sheer. Also, it has functional pockets - my cell phone was able to fit with room to spare. In short, it is pretty darn close to a perfect skirt, and I will definitely be buying additional ones!",

It doesn't cinch like it looks like it should. Back half is elastic band so pretty stretchy. Also has a zipper that's completely unneeded due to the stretchiness of the band and the material. This skirt could really benefit if the flat waistband extended further to the back making the elastic part maybe 4-6 inches wide. Or skip the elastic band altogether and make it tie like a corset in the back. But it would need to be made of thicker more rigid material for that. It is pretty thin fabric. I feel like you can see my black undies thru it a smidge. But it's soft. Still a pretty cute skirt.,4

There is no way you can wear this skirt in Autumn and Winter if you live somewhere that has four distinct seasons.
