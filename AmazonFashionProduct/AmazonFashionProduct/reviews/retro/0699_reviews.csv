Plus, the ones with the pink glass, its frame doesn't look like in the picture that looks ""clear-pink"". The ones I got are ""clear- transparent"". So, no pink color in the frame. Another thing, the description on the title of the advertisement says they're small but you take a look on the pictures of the ladies in the advertisement and they don't look so small.

They are such a fun (and useful) accessory that I can't stop buying them. My collection is filled with high end pieces ($350+) and I like my mid to low range pieces too. I picked this set up because I thought $6.67/per pair was a great price for polarized glasses and if something happens to them, my soul won't levitate from my body.  These are great for outdoor activities. I love to wear them hiking, kayaking, paddle boarding, a day at the beach or any other place where there are conditions where my expensive glasses could get lost or ruined. These are also lightweight, so they don't feel cumbersome to wear and don't slip off my face easy.  The glasses are a bit small, both in temple width and in the frame size. They aren't so small that they squeeze my head or look bad though. But if you like larger frames or have a bigger head, these aren't the shades for you.  Now, I want to keep in mind that these are ridiculously affordable, but you definitely get what you pay for because these are quite thin and not very durable. They are not going to bounce back if you sit on them, rather they will break in half.  The thing that makes these really worth it is the polarized lenses. They make everything so crisp and clear. They also do a much better job protecting your eyes. A card comes in the box so you can test the lenses and see what difference the polarization makes.  These arrived quick, all 3 pairs of glasses wrapped in plastic and in seperate zipper bags. There is one soft, drawstring case in the box too.  While these aren't the best, most durable glasses in the world, they are very affordable, protect my eyes well and pretty cute. They are perfect for my needs too.",

However, The glasses with the pink lens have a clear frame but on the advertisement picture it makes it look like the lens and frame are both pink, but they're not. I wasn't too happy about the color difference so that's what took the stars down for me personally, I was really excited about that pair. The polarized test worked for every pair, when I put them on and looked at the card I could see two people on the beach, when I took them off they disappeared, that was pretty cool. They came with a carrying sack, three individual plastic carrying bags, one for each pair, a cleaning cloth, and the polarized tester card.

They are sturdy and lightweight and on the smaller side. I wish they came with 3 cases instead of the one. But other than that they are good for the money,

grandma24,I’m picky about my sunglasses & these pass the test with flying colors!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R273EXG60X0MKX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBHHL3PY,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 8, 2024",Color: 3pack（black/Gray+clear Pink/Pink Mirror+tortoise Frame/Brown Lens)Lens Color: gray,,"My criteria for sunglasses is as follows:  must be inexpensive because I treat them badly & they get scratched, broken or lost often;  must be polarized so I can see well;  must be dark enough to protect my sensitive eyes, but not so dark that I can’t see anything;  must not have wire frames because they are too flimsy for my abuse; must have the molded nosepiece so it doesn’t get tangled in my hair when I wear my sunglasses on top of my head; must be attractive.  I know it is a long list, but life is too short to put up with little annoyances you can easily avoid.  Long story short–these sunglasses tick all the boxes, and they are really cute too.  They also came with a bonus microfiber cleaning cloth and a soft drawstring carry bag to help protect them.  I love these glasses!",

She loves that the lenses are relatively small (she doesn't care for the traditional oversized lenses of most women's sunglasses) and round.  Very simple and classic. They are lightweight and stay put when worn (no slipping off her nose).  Her favorite pair out of the three are the clear pink mirror sunglasses.  The pictures shown in the description make them seem way more pink than they really are; depending on the angle and sun hitting the lenses is when you truly see the pink.She loves them, has three options to choose from, so that's a thumbs up from her on the YMRFW Retro Polarized Sunglasses.",

These are a cool ""change it up"" thing. They do have a reasonable field of view, even at night, and are comfortable to wear.  They also have screws to attach the temples that like all, should be tightened, now and then.  Not the best, in full sunlight, but are more than adequate.",

They have a similar shape to the Rayban club master sunglasses, but these are more modern and square looking. They seem to be made from a decent material and have held up pretty well to every day use. I like them so much that it ended up getting a few different color variations.",
