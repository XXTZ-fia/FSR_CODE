I wore them to a 70s party but they weren’t worth what I paid. I think they were $5.99 or something I would’ve preferred to pay $1.25. but they served their purpose. I wore them for the occasion and they lasted for the occasion I have not worn them since. So I cannot say if they were last or not because I don’t wear them every day,
