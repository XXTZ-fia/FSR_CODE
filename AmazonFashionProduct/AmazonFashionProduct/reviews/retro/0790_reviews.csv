Mrs. Disco,Perfect sunglasses,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21NISVNDH8RQ6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFWKK8DS,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Color: C4-tortoise/Clear Brown,Verified Purchase,"I was looking for this exact style as a dupe of a designer pair I had my eyes on. They are almost exact, these are sturdy and have good lenses. Over 300 dollars less than the designer pair, totally worth it. Won’t regret buying these!",
JTHB,"Eh, the jury is still out on these",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B1JJ6LE3NCYO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFWKK8DS,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Color: C4-tortoise/Clear Brown,,"I am really torn on these sunnies. They look sort of cute, but the shape of the lens sort of goes down at the edges and has a sad look to them. I know that sounds weird, but I look SAD when I wear them! Not sure if thats to accommodate the lower arms of the glasses...the jury is still out on the look.  However, they feel well made and sturdy. I wore them for a few hours and did not have much pressure behind my ears which I appreciate. If the look is for you, these are well made and definitely recommend. But the look is odd on me!",

Sami Smith Official,Mind bending arms but also head bending if worn too long…,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZZVEJN1E697Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DFWKK8DS,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 21, 2024",Color: C3-tortoise/Purple,,"When I first saw these, I took a triple take because I thought maybe the picture had been Photoshop or something. My mind was bent, looking at where they had attached the arms of the glasses to the frames as they’re set lower than normal. I thought they were kind of cool and so I’ve decided to give them a try. When they arrived, they were packaged well had a very nice quality cleaning cloth and a cloth case to boot. However, I cannot wear them for long at all as they start to pinch my head and hurt my brain. I do have a larger than average size head. I guess it could say , so maybe if you have a small head, they will work for you. The quality was actually decent for the pRice point so I was definitely disappointed that they won’t work for me. Also liked the weight as they aren’t too heavy.",
