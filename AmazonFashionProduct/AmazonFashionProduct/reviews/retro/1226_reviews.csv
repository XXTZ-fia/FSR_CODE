You have to unfold the side shields to open or close them, which makes sense if you thought about it (I obviously didn’t).

Thought that was pretty neat, along with a little card to test and prove the polarization of the glasses. Finding out that you can fold in the side shields as well was a pleasant surprise, which makes it not a problem in tucking them away.
