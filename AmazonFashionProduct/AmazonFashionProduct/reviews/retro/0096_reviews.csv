WorldTravelr,Top is cute. Bottoms look like a diaper. Best for super svelte bodies.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLEN02K397ECZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C3QPCTLC,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 7, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Black_5,,"Right off the bat, I will say my girlfriend and I had high hopes for this. We loved the retro look and style of it in the pictures, so we ordered it. It came faster than almost any product we've ordered. My gf is 5'6 and 140 lbs. Not necessarily overweight but there is a small 40 year year old 'thicker in the middle' thing happening, although she hits the bike hard after work.  The top was fantastic. She wears a Medium in most swimsuits, so we ordered a Medium. The top was incredibly cute and fit her 34C chest nicely. The bottom was horrible and looked like a Sumo diaper. While her tummy isn't flat, she doesn't have a big belly yet these bottoms really made her middle look wide and barrel shaped. Going up a size wouldn't be the answer ... it was a combination of the fit and her body shape.  We've decided to throw out the bottoms, keep the top and pair it with a solid black standard bikini bottom. For teens and very svelte body types, it might work for you. I'd imagine XS or S sizes would look okay, especially if you have a long torso with a thin waist/stomach. For average sized girls that don't have a perfectly flat tummy, it's probably going to look strange.  We ordered the black and white gingham matching top & bottom set. It looks somewhat like the pictures, except the pattern is a little lighter grey and looks printed on up close. If it fit right, it would absolutely be retro cute ... and the top really is nice when paired with a different style bottom.  Overall, my recommendation is to order true to size and if you are a little pair shaped, don't attempt this. It looked so bad, my gf didn't want to post a picture of her wearing it. I'd recommend smaller body styles wear this best ... however, the suit has a fantastic retro 1940s or 1950s style which is very hard to find. I hope my honest description and pictures help you make an informed shopping decision.",4

Poverty All-Natural Shopper,Flattering. A Few Flaws. Colors Are Slightly Different.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TFR11SFDJ3X9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C3QPCTLC,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 27, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Red_1,,"For reference, I’m an eccentric Goth that typically wears a teen size S or XS and a 32B bra, I’m 5’4, 115 pounds, and I have the Theatrical Romantic Kibbe body type. I ordered this bikini in a size S in the color “Red_1,” which is the red gingham print. Overall, the fit is great and very flattering, and it is not see-thru. The lighter red squares in the gingham pattern appear pinker in person than they do in the product images. The red is a little different too. In person, it’s a basic red with the tiniest bit of pink, whereas in the product images, I’d say the red is a deeper, almost rusty blood-red. Still, it looks nice, and the retro vibe remains intact.  The padding in the top is removable and a little thicker than usual, which is perfect for my small chest, giving me some nice cleavage. However, I would have preferred even more cleavage, which the even thicker padding in some of my favorite swimsuits provides. The stitching of the top corners where the solid red triangles meet the halter tie stands is not the best, as edges of inside material are slightly visible when I have it tied tightly in place. I also don’t think there is as much material to tie the front bow as is shown in the product images, as I can’t get the bottom of the bow to come down nearly as far after tying it.  The bottoms fit nicely on my small waist, but the band is tight enough that it’s precarious to pull it up over my hips without hearing threads break. Still, I’d rather that than it being loose. The butt has pretty full coverage, which doesn’t look as good on me as something skimpier, but it's true to the retro style. Even for a cut that I usually hate, it still looks pretty good, just not super sexy.  Overall, this bikini flatters my shape very much, really giving me an authentic pin-up look. Despite a few small flaws, I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a flattering, retro-style swimsuit.",10

I usually stick to black or dark blue swimsuits but when I saw the red gingham I fell in love. I am 5’6” and 150lbs and wear a medium in most things so that is what I ordered. The bottoms fit perfect. The top was a little tough (snug) getting on but once it was on it felt good (and secure). I am an A cup so the padding is a plus! I’m not sure how this suit would fit on someone with a large bust.,5

The top is so cute. I'm getting a black pair of bottoms to go work the top. The bottoms don't look right on me. I'm thicker in the bottom so doesn't look right. I sized up like normal and that worked well. This suit is made well and has some cute details.",7
