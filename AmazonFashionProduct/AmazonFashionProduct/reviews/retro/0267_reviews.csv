It did wrinkle rather quickly while riding in the car on the way to the event, but a family member brought a steamer and straightened me out ahead of time. The one thing that I was NOT a fan of regarding this dress was that one of the seams tin the skirt ran straight down the front middle of the dress. The pleating wasn’t enough to distract from the seam, but I seemed to be the only one who really noticed so it wasn’t a big deal.",4

The dress is well made and not flimsy at all  2 things: -if you want the full skirt effect, buy a pettycoat, I’m wearing one in the photo. - I recommend dry cleaning bc the second time wearing I dropped some dressing on it… I washed it at home and ironed on low too but I’m sure if I had dry cleaned it would be more back to when I bought. By no means, the dress was ruined, not at all but you know what I mean when you dry cleaned… it gets more crisp.  Anyway, it’s beautiful and I’m thinking about buying in another color.",13

It is not too short, though. It is above the knee on my really tall daughter. For New Year’s, one of my adult daughters, just dressed it up with a really nice jewelry and nice heels. We’ve used it as a recital dress. I really think it was originally purchased for a quinceanera. But, it was some of the best money I have ever spent. easy to wash. Just needs to be touched up with an iron or a steamer if the girls wad it up.  For your mom’s, it is sexy without being too, revealing. Your child won’t look like a slut in it. It could go for any age. Has a very classic cut to it. I have girls that are busty and I have girls that are flat, and it is flattering to all of them.",3
