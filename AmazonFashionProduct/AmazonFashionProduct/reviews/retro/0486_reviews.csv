It was basically just stuffed in the bag and had a business card stuck on top, so someone did see it, to put the card in it, but didn't address the item to fold it decently. The crotch sticker was not on the crotch area, but was stuck inside near it. So was it worn?? Who knows, but yuck. Material is flimsy, there is no tummy control as was advertised, and the chest has no support (actually squishes the chest down). So no compression where there should be, and compression where there shouldn’t be. I wouldn’t have liked it regardless, but in addition to all that, once it was on, I saw that under the chest, on the outside totally visible, there was a long mess of sewing string hanging right in the middle front. Clearly a defect in the construction. I thought these were supposed to be decent quality, but it’s absolutely junk.",

Took off one star because the part that kind of goes around the top of the straps (in the front) looks a little faded after just one wear. Hopefully it won’t continue to fade. (Also, if you’ve never worn a swim dress before like me, when you bend forward to spray your legs, the skirt part will dip forward/down and cover your knees when you spray sunscreen. So take my advice and also LIFT the skirt to spray your knees. Otherwise you may get sunburned knees like I did. Oops!)",

Underneath the skirt are short bicycle shorts that are attached to the suit body. I would prefer if the underside was a standard attached panty bottom. This makes it easier to pull it to the side for bathroom breaks, whereas the bike short bottoms require pulling the whole bathing suit down to your lower thighs when you have to go to the ladies room. I can tell you that this was quite a nuisance at the pool party I attended yesterday. It was quite a workout pulling down a wet swim suit off of a damp/wet body. It was even harder pulling the wet suit back on; I literally started to break a sweat, and was thankful nobody else was in the room to bear witness to my struggles! I may ask a friend who sews if she can modify the bike short bottoms to a classic panty for this purpose. Other than that, I got several compliments on the swim suit at the 4th of July party I attended yesterday, and I was comfortable all day.",4

This swimsuit has no hem at bottom edge. The shorts underneath are navy blue. It has 2 sets of straps. The wide strap which you see in the photo and then a thin strap underneath which is adjustable. When you adjust the under strap to a small shorter length, the cover strap doesn't stretch and shrink to fit so it falls off the shoulder. You can see the understrap in one of the videos on the product page, but the model must be able to wear the swimsuit with understrap at longest setting, because is does not fall off her shoulder. If you are small and have to adjust strap to shortest length then the over strap just falls loose off the shoulder.",

I’ve wanted one for ages but never really had an occasion to get a new swimsuit, but then a professor of mine hosted a pool party and I wanted to wear something more modest and nicer-looking than my practical-but-frumpy one-piece suits. So, I bought this specific swim dress because the crossed chest looked very elegant and even the critical reviews seemed promising….and I am so happy with it!! There is some critique about the straps being doubled, with the adjustable belt straps underneath non-adjustable neoprene straps, but they worked fine enough for me that I don’t have any significant comments on them. The L fit worked out wonderfully for me (I am 5’5” and about 180 lbs with rather broad shoulders), and the dress is comfortable to wear both dry and wet. When it IS in water, the skirt does float up around you, of course, and when out again it has added weight but not extremely so! I find that if you wring or squeeze out the water it dries fairly well, although definitely not as fast as a non-skirted swimsuit. Overall, it’s a general recommendation from me for sure! Super happy with this, thank you!",6

As I sit here, I am debating whether to buy the black and white one. I bought the black with cherries and love it! I am 5ft 3in and weigh 165 pounds. I tried both the large and XL, I kept the XL even though the large fit. The large wasn't uncomfortable but, I have MS and Parkinson's disease and it causes pain when wearing something too constrictive so went with the XL. A little more room in the belly and less back fat showing. I have lost another 5 pounds so now wondering if I want to buy the black and white in LG. Some might say this is not a sexy suit, but I disagree and so does my husband. I took out the breast pads and still show cleavage, The skirt shows off the butt quite nicely in a flirty kind of way and my stomach has not looked this good in a suit for years. The shorts are built into the suit which I love, and it is easy to put on. The material is kind of heavy and the skirt lays like it should. I can't say what it is like when wet as I bought it for when were in Hawaii, at the end of April. Give the suit a try if you're on the fence about it.  So glad I did, my self-esteem went up way higher than it was when trying other suits on.",13

You'll notice that there are 2 straps per arm.  One is thin & is used to tighten or loosen the fit.  The other one, is thicker & lays right over the thin strap, giving the suit a more ""finished"" look.  The problem that I had was, after I tighten the straps, the thicker strap that laid over the thinner strap was far to loose.  I suppose I could have attached the loose material with a safety pin or cut the loose material & sewed it back together.  It wasn't worth my time or effort, so I sent it back.",2

To begin, it gives a nice push up to the breasts 😉 I did have to remove the pads that came inside the bra area, it fit me a little tight until I removed them and I had no more issues. The straps length can be adjusted as well. Also, the Tummy coverage is good! The ruffles in the fabric and the flowy skirt give the tummy area a good look. The skirt is long enough to cover everything that needs to be covered. This was a huge plus for me! In summary, the fabric quality of this dress is nice. It's thick and just makes this dress look very high quality. I definitely recommend it! It's very flattering 😉",18
