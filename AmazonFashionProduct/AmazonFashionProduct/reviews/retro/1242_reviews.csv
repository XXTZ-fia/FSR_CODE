The stitches look like they will hold up to a lot of washing. The item description differs just a little in that the skirt is actually 95% cotton, not 97%.  I bought the large based on the size chart but even on the tighter button, it was too loose for my liking. I would prefer a snug waist for A-line skirts. The buttons should be the same or similar shade as the skirt instead of transparent. I feel like transparent buttons are more easily seen and I would want to hide them with my top instead of wearing my top inside of the skirt. It was easy to zip and the cloth is thick/heavy, so I don't see the need for lining.  Overall, it's a lovely skirt and I may update my review if I get a medium instead.",3

There's pockets! and the pattern is beautiful.  It definitely holds up to some of my higher end pieces.  In the picture, the bottom looks scalloped but it is a regular straight hem.  Not a deal breaker for me but not as pictured.  This skirt is perfect for work or a semi dressy event",

The pattern drew me and I was finally able to buy it. However I must say that while I am a little disappointed that the skirt came wrinkly, that can be fixed. What I deducted stars for was the fit. I am small at around 5ft and just over 100 pounds  so I knew I was taking a chance with this skirt since I knew it ran long but it comes well below my knees and fell to my hips. If I pull the skirt up and hold it tight in the back it looks better but bunches. I am annoyed they didn’t have a smaller size but I suppose I knew the risk I was taking when I ordered and will just have to alter it. The skirt is not amazing quality but did not seem shear, picked, or stained on arrival either. All this being said you get what you buy and with this you’re buying an average mass produced skirt in a cute pattern. I personally think this product is about ten dollars over priced, but I did buy didn’t I?",

You can see what looks like fading/wear in the picture - this is the 2nd wear (1 wash) since purchase. This picture was taken at the end of day and since the elastic isn't seen in the waist band and the fabric waist band area is much wider than the elastic, the elastic rotates within the fabric around which causes this look I believe.
