The accessories are cool too, especially the mini screwdriver. I'm knocking off a star only because I HATE the top bar (which I've since removed) and because the fit is a tad tight around the ears, but not uncomfortably so and at least they won't slip down on my nose.",3

Both the sunglasses and packaging were amazing at this price point. I've been very happy with the color (I ordered brown/brown) and the durability. I'm not easy on these and they get tossed around the car a bit and they're fine after a year and nine months. I've had compliments on the style and have definitely thought about buying a few different versions.  I did try on the pair I bought for a friend which were the black/gray and I found the color of the lenses to be far too much on the cool side so if you're sensitive to cold colored optics I'd avoid the black lenses.,

Quality of the glasses appears to be good and they are reasonably sturdy for what they are.  Only caveat for me is that my head is wide enough that the connecting hooks of the tension springs on the ear pieces poke me uncomfortably at my temples.  I simply turned the springs so the hook faced outwards and all was well after that. Overall I like them so far. Perhaps I'll report back after wearing them for a time.  Cheers.,
