Veronica,Great Little Speaker,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Q65UOBBUR073/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DN119QQM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 28, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"I love this Bluetooth speaker. I’m an avid reader and when I’m doing things around the house and can’t be physically reading, I have Alexa read my books to me through my Alexa app. I don’t like wearing headphones or earbuds very much so I was looking for an alternative to that and found this gem. It’s a little heavier than I expected but the clip is strong and it’s holds great when clipped on clothing. Now I can do things around the house and still enjoy my books without having to pause a stationary Bluetooth speaker when I need to go upstairs.",

She has a large collection of CDs and loves to stay active around the house, yard, or even while plein air painting. This speaker turned out to be the perfect companion for her.  The sound quality is crisp and surprisingly rich for such a small device. It paired effortlessly with the CD player and has exceeded both of our expectations. The design makes it easy for her to use and wear while staying mobile, which she loves.  Watching her enjoy her music again—whether she's painting outdoors or doing chores—has been a real joy. This simple, portable solution truly made her day and has brought her a lot of happiness.",

I use it to play music when I'm taking a shower, as it is waterproof. It has been working really well, and has not given me any issues. I have not faced any issues with the Bluetooth connectivity or using it in the shower. It has a good quality sound that comes out of it but unfortunately is not always loud enough that I hear music well over the sound of the shower.",
Francis,Not as loud as I'd hope,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XZW38O9CIN9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DN119QQM,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",,,"I have a Samsung s20+ and sometimes I have used my phone just to play music out loud so I am comparing the speakers on my Samsung phone to this. To my surprise, this did not sound significantly louder than my Samsung did at max volume. Not sure if there is a software issue or what but when paired to this speaker and I have the volume on the speaker at about 60-65%, if I were to max it out to 100% volume, the volume literally sounds like it did not move from 60%. It sounds just about the same as my Samsung phone which is a bit disappointing. I did like how this can be clipped onto your clothes or whatever you see fit. Not sure if I would recommend them at this point.",
Larry,"awesome, best of kind",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R51XOT2S9KADD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DN119QQM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",,,"I have reviewed 5 small speakers. This product is by far the best. The sound quality is remarkably fine, better than much larger ones I have tried. The bass ""radiators"" on both sides provide an especially deep rich sound. The sound quality remains fine even when running the volume at max. And the max volume is loud!  The battery life is good. It links by Bluetooth to my ipad and iphone smoothly, and retains the link up to 30 feet across the house. As promised, it runs for 10 hours and charges in 2 or so hours. The metal belt clip is strong, with anti-slip pins so I do not worry about it falling off. It feels solidly built, so should survive some hard falls (I've not tested this).  It supports TWS pairing. Two of these can be linked to create stereophonic sound, an interesting feature I might try sometime.  The product description says it takes 1 AAA battery, which is incorrect (it uses the usual internal rechargeable battery). The description also says this has a mount for door, which is also wrong.  I highly recommend this product.",

I tried another brand of wearable speaker in the past, and while it was lighter weight than this one, the sound quality just wasn’t there. For such a small speaker, I was pleasantly surprised by this - for what it is and for the size, I think it’s pretty good! Easy to pair the Bluetooth, it has buttons built in so you don’t have to reach for your device, and the clip is pretty sturdy. Feels solid and well built. Worked out perfectly for my needs, and so far it has been the best sound quality of any mini (like mini mini) speaker I’ve used to far.",
Robert Dorr,Fantastic audio from such a small speaker,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MBT7ZZ8MBW5P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DN119QQM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",,,"I have reviewed several of the small, wearable, personal speakers and the sound from the Divoom itour-s is the best I have ever heard from such a small speaker. Using Bluetooth 5.3 it syncs to whatever you are pairing to, quickly and accurately with very little lag. The sound is crisp and clear with plenty of volume. It reproduces a nice amount of base primarily related to the baffles that they have incorporated into the sides of the speaker. I can't recommend this speaker high enough. This speaker id, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",
Pickles,"Compact, Sturdy, and Surprisingly Loud: A Perfect Travel Companion",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMF4VA8J8X51H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DN119QQM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",,,"The Divoom Itour-S Portable Mini Wearable Bluetooth Speaker has quickly earned a spot in my daily carry. Despite its tiny size, it delivers a powerful punch in sound quality, making it a standout for anyone looking for portability without sacrificing audio performance.  Design and Build : One of the first things I noticed is the premium build quality. The speaker feels solid and well-made, with a metal clip that’s both sturdy and functional. The clip has a limited range of motion, so it works best on smaller items like belts, bag straps, or clothing. It also has a small rubber track around the clip’s perimeter, which helps keep the speaker in place when standing upright or lying on its back. This thoughtful detail ensures it doesn’t slide around during use.  Usability and Features: This speaker is as user-friendly as it gets. It’s incredibly easy to pair with devices, thanks to the latest Bluetooth 5.3 technology, which offers a stable connection and no noticeable lag when streaming video or audio. The TWS pairing feature is a nice touch if you want to link two speakers for a bigger soundstage, though I haven’t tried it myself.  Another highlight is its IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating. I’ve taken it on hikes and used it in less-than-ideal weather conditions, and it’s held up perfectly. It’s reassuring to know that it can handle a bit of water or dirt without issue.  Sound Quality: For its size, the sound quality is genuinely impressive. The bass is punchy, the mids are clear, and it even handles higher volumes without distorting. I’ve used it with my tablet and laptop, both of which have tinny speakers, and the improvement is night and day. Whether I’m listening to music, audiobooks, or streaming Netflix, this speaker provides rich and full-bodied audio.  Playtime and Charging: With a 10-hour playtime on a full charge and a quick recharge time of about 2.5 hours, the Itour-S is always ready to go. I haven’t run into any issues with battery life, even on longer outings.  Room for Improvement: While I’m thrilled with this speaker, the clip’s limited range of motion could be an issue if you want to attach it to thicker objects. It’s also not going to replace larger speakers for filling a big room with sound, but that’s expected for something this compact.  Comparison to Other Speakers: Having tried dozens of Bluetooth speakers, from pocket-sized to larger models, I can confidently say the Itour-S offers unmatched sound quality for its size. Many similar products focus on portability but compromise on audio. This speaker balances both beautifully.  Final Thoughts: (Personally Love It) The Divoom Itour-S is an excellent choice for anyone who wants a compact, durable, and great-sounding Bluetooth speaker. It’s perfect for travel, outdoor activities, or as an upgrade for devices with lackluster built-in speakers. If you’re looking for something small that doesn’t skimp on sound quality, this one’s hard to beat.",
Anesthesiologist,Great little speaker!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34FJU2ODDIBRF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DN119QQM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",,,"The Divoom portable Bluetooth speaker is fantastic. It has a clean, modern design, fits comfortably in my hand, and delivers nearly 10 hours of battery life at moderate volume, as advertised.  The sound is loud and clear, making it ideal for both music and phone calls. The Bluetooth connection has also impressed me; I’ve been able to walk to my basement without my phone and still experienced minimal distortion.  The build quality feels solid, the buttons are satisfyingly tactile, and the soft blue light on the front adds a nice touch without being harsh.  One thing to note is that it lacks a Bluetooth device-switching feature, which means you’d need to disconnect from one device before connecting another. While this hasn’t been a major issue for me, it’s worth considering if you often switch between devices.  Overall, the Divoom Bluetooth speaker performs exceptionally well, and I highly recommend it!",

Not A Robot,It really IS punchy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FIXLN4TPK2MY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DN119QQM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2025",,,"So first of all, this little marvel is fun-sized. Like literally it's almost exactly the same size as those little Snickers. Not the mini squares but the half-bar sized nevermind, this isn't about candy.  You wouldn't expect this delicious little speaker nugget (or nougat?) to put out the sound that it does. The description they gave of ""punchy"" is definitely accurate. It punches way above its weight class.  It's loud and full, with good projection and without sounding too tinny. It has decent articulation for its size, with only the slightest hint of muddiness.  Pairing was straight-forward and possibly the easiest of all the speakers I've ever used. The controls are minimal and functional, and that's exactly what I would expect them to be on a portable speaker. Why waste valuable sound real estate on extra buttons that I'm gonna forget the instructions about anyway? Up, down, power, that thing is a woofer so quit poking it, and that's it. Nice.  The plastic case it comes in is actually pretty flippin' sweet too. If you don't use it for the speaker (probably because the speaker is always in use, because the more songs I play, the more I appreciate it) then there's a hundred things it would be great for. I could actually see buying this case as a stand-alone case, it's that well constructed and such a handy size.  Tastes in music vary, so here's a few artists that I've run through this speaker so far:  Imogen Heap Eurythmics Weird Al AJR Poor Man's Poison Bo Burnham Sia They Might Be Giants AWOLNATION The Mountain Goats Eminem feat. Sia (totally forgot about that song!)  * These were streamed from an online service, unknown but standard streaming bitrate for the not-me-tube.*  This little speaker performed well on all of those, but it did struggle a little on some AWOLNATION songs. Many speakers do though, and it was still better than I expected at this price point.  I just saw that it can be paired with another of its kind, like some bigger brands can do, and that just makes it even cooler. I am so here for it.  Absolutely can and will recommend this speaker without a second thought.",3
Crazy Cat Momma,Love this,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LKTUC38Q9EN8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DN119QQM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2025",,,Powerful little speaker.  Loved this so much I got a 2nd.,

I don't know what its made of, but its a nice, rigid, hard material that doesn't feel like cheap, thin plastic. Its simple to operate and puts out a lot of sound for its small size. The sound is crisp and clear and not too heavy on the bass or treble. I was actually quite surprised at how good it sounds and am very pleased with it. The plastic box it comes in is handy to store it in when not in use or when traveling to protect it in my bag.",
Herman,"Not A Typical Wearable Speaker, Really a Small Portable Speaker with Mike.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S97Z3ZTREBHU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DN119QQM,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2024",,,"I use wearable clip on speakers a lot. I like to listen to music or podcasts while hiking and kayaking, but I also need my ears open to whats happening around me. Also, if I'm on the water and I end up IN the water, no big deal with these little clip on Bluetooth speakers. But this is no little clip on Bluetooth speaker. I knew this the moment I picked it up.  WEIGHT: First, this guy is HEAVY! At almost 6 onces, its over a third of a pound. It's nearly 2x as heavy as my other clip on speakers. It's too heavy to clip onto regular clothing, but works on a knapsack or crossbody bag.  VOLUME: This little guy packs a real punch in term of volume. It can get VERY loud. You could easily use this as a portable speaker to listen to music or movies outside as a group. At it's loudest, its really loud inside a car. My other clip ons literally can only get to about 25% of the volume of this speaker.  SOUND QUALITY: Not an audiophile, but bass seems deeper and higher tons are not as tinny. The only weird thing, and I almost didn't mention this, is that I did hear some background hissing ONE time on one of my podcasts. I closed the app and listened to the same podcast again with no issues. I wasn't able to recreate the hissing, but other reviewers have noted this as an issue. Dialog is clear, both on phone calls and podcasts.  MICROPHONE: Mike is just okay, per the people I've called. The speaker does need to be close to you for the mike to pick up your speech.  BUILD QUALITY: Build quality seems good! I have not dunked this in water, and I'm not going to, at least not intentionally. But I did use this in an unexpected decent rain shower with no issues.  GIFTABLE PACKAGING? It depends! This comes in a clear, hard plastic, reusable, case with a clip. Your eco-conscious friends may give you the stink eye, unless you also mention that the case can be used to store paperclips, fasteners, beads, etc. etc. so it's really two gifts in one!  Overall, this is more like a portable, waterproof speaker with a built in microphone, vs. a typical clip on Bluetooth speaker. Really unique and impressive product.",3
