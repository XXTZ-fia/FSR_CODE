He also loves this camo jacket and pants but the fabric snags or gets fuzzy in areas when something may rub against it like the safety belt in your car or a backpack or on the pants where your leg meets the chair.  We sent the first one back and ordered another in hopes it was a fluke but the second suit did the same. He decided to keep it because he loves the design and fabric so much and will only wear it when not going anyplace where he needs to make an impression.  We hope they can fix this problem with the fabric and keep this version in the lineup.",5
