Texas Shopper,Smocked cuffs are cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUPKVX121S40U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DT6JS4WG,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 6, 2024",Color: C-green StripeSize: Large,,"This shirt has classic menswear elements, but the smocked cuffs, relaxed fit and stripes in cute colors give it a more feminine vibe for women. I chose the one with green and white stripes and the green is fairly dark, but it's broken up by equal amounts of white so it comes off as less dark. I love how the crisp contrast of the stripes sets off the softer cut of the shirt. The fabric is thin and soft, so it is cool and drapes nicely. It looks like cotton shirting fabric but it is 65% polyester which gives it more of a synthetic feel even though it looks like cotton. The buttons are plastic but have a pretty pearly look that is slightly translucent. They blend right in and don't detract or add much to the shirt, but they do look nice. The smocked wrists make interesting patterns with the striped fabric.  As I expected, this shirt was fairly wrinkled when it arrived, but a quick ironing smoothed out easily for a crisp and tidy look. If you try it on right out of the bag and don't like it, give the shirt a nice pressing before giving up on it. It made a huge difference, in my opinion. The shirttail hem is a few inches longer in back which I prefer, because I usually wear this type of shirt untucked and I just like the look of a slightly longer tail in back. But because the fabric is soft and thin, it's perfect for tucking in. I like the box pleat in back for a little added fullness in the fit.  I'd say this shirt runs true to size, but keep in mind that is for a relaxed fit. It washes nicely; I've only washed it once so far. I machine-washed it in cold water and hung it to dry on a hanger. I don't think it will shrink since it is 65% polyester and 35% cotton, but it fits just how I like, so I don't want to risk shrinking it in the dryer.  Overall, this bouse is a nice choice for menswear button-down stripes with a relaxed fit and some feminine touches. It's both soft and crisp. It can be dressed down for weekends or dressed up for work.",

Fit was also good, true to size. My only complaint is the look of the shirt is ruined by the smock stitching. I love the smocking, but rather than lining up the pinstripe, they just sewed. Just didn’t like the way it looks. I will return and purchase a solid color. Ugh",

The fabric has almost like a windbreaker type feeling to it, in that it is very lightweight but not very breathable. The clack and white stripes are so close together that it looks more like a patterned shirt, not a striped black and white. It is true to size.  As a Vine reviewer I try to provide good information. My scale: Most things will start at 4 stars. It gets that extra star only if it is outstanding. It loses stars for issues- bad sizing, poor quality. One star if is is not suitable for purpose or for gross misrepresentation.",2

I wore this blouse only bcuz I had no other pink blouse and needed the blouse but the cut is so off that I’m amazed no one has complained. I had to disguise the crazy blouse and couldn’t wait to get home where I immediately tossed the worthless blouse into the trash to hopefully never see that embarrassment again. It cost yes, but I was so disappointed and disgusted with that blouse that all I wanted was not to see this blouse again so I threw it into the trash. Be very careful ordering blouses from off of Amazon. Never know what you may get. Lesson learned for me. Thanks",
