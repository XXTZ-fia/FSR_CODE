I've been using it for over 2 years now and it has held up considerably well. However, the one con that drives me nuts is that it doesn't always stay closed. You bump the purse into something and the clasp comes open allowing anyone access if you don't catch it in time or I'veeven had some things fall out (luckily while i was home). I've resorted to tying a hair elastic around the clasp for security when I'm out and about because I'm tired of messing with it. Not very good design.",

Other purses with zippers  were constantly ruining my nails by causing catching, spliting, and breakage.

(Granted, I do NOT give my purses an easy time.)My first order was for a green one on sale.  Even the green is a a soft color and goes with a lot of outfits.  I just ordered a brown one. The inside is ONE compartment so I know where my things are.  There are two small pouches id needed for smaller items.I would love to see this purse style in off-white or more summer pastels.  One can afford to buy several in different colors because of their inexpensive price.  I can NOT imagine anyone not enjoying these purses.  They are now my #1 pick!Jeanne Eanes",3
