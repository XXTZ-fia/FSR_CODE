There was a minor imperfection at the edge of the collar that I was able to fix with some hand sewing.  I did however need to hand sew the two layers of the overlapping collar together in the middle because it was pulling a lot in the top two buttons. This may be because my bust measures slightly smaller than the XS (which is currently their smallest size). Altogether it took only 20min to fix so not a big deal.  The dress does ride up a little when you walk though, so I have to pull the skirt back down periodically once I stop moving which is a tad bit annoying. If like me you are only planning on using the dress occasionally I still recommend buying it.",3
