Cut and style of the dress is gorgeous, but too many quality issues. First, the material is heavily synthetic with a lot of elastic give, like 90% synthetic and 10% cotton. The material does not breathe at all. See pictures. Second, material is NOT dyed well. I returned the originally ordered dress because there were white striations in the fabric, especially at seams and where the dress material was folded over for hemming, like the cap sleeves. Now, the replacement 2nd dress is showing the same issues. It’s almost like the black dye was sublimated onto the material versus actually having dyed thread of two colors. The fabric thread is not both black and white— just white. After prewashing the dress in cold water by rinsing it in the shower while it hung on a hanger (no detergent, no bunching it up to wash, did not use a washing machine), the black literally disappeared from the dress in sections. Like bad paint. See pictures. So disappointed. Returning the 2nd dress as the black color is not the initial color of the thread. This poor dye overrides the cute look & cut of the dress & it being sewed well. The synthetic fabric and synthetic color is horrible.",

I don't have time to hunt for a new dress, so this melty synthetic disgusting mess it will be, but let the buyer beware... They're lying to you.  Further, the size small is too small, and the medium too large if you're about 5' and 100 lbs.
