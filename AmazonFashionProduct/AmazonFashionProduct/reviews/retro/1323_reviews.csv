It's still a great shirt; I own one in black with a red stripe as well. The packaging however, downright sucks. Shirt is wrapped up tighter than a burrito. You can see how wrinkled it is, and you have to absolutely iron it to get them out before you can even wear it. I know Amazon is trying to pack smaller, but how about packing smarter too? That being said, it's a great value for the price, and being 6'2"", 310 lbs, this shirt is incredibly comfortable. It justs needs to be packed better to cut down on the wrinkling.",
