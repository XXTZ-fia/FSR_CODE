Life In California,Terrific for Valentines Day,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KHYJQI1E1QQQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BH9F45KK,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 17, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Our son's elementary school does not allow children to distribute candy on Valentine's Day, which is a bummer. We’ve had to come up with creative alternatives for Valentine's greetings. So, we decided to go with an 80s theme and made retro cassette tapes and attached these sunglasses. They were a huge hit. Kids really seemed to like them. All except for one of the glasses arrived unbroken. Our son still loves playing with his glasses, and they even came in handy for an 80s themed birthday party my older son attended last week.",
