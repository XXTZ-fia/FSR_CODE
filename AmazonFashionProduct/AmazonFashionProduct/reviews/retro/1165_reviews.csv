The hinges do not overextended so you're limited to one fit.,

They don’t look or feel cheap at all. I have a small head, larger than a child though lol. They fit perfectly and are comfortable across the bridge of my nose. I can see how they COULD be snug for some wearers. I will definitely take care not to sit on these puppies🤙🏻",

Northeast Gal,Sunglasses for the Serial Loser (and Breaker),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP118PGH2ECOJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHWYP35M,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Color: 3pcs-black+leopard+brownSize: One size fits all,,"I'm constantly losing or breaking my sunglasses—call it a talent—so I stick with cheapies to keep my wallet and my sanity intact. When I saw this 3-pack, I thought, 'Perfect!' Now I can roll with one pair at a time while the others stay wrapped up and safe in their little cocoons, ready for their moment to shine (or block the shine, I guess).  They're super lightweight, which isn’t a bad thing because heavy glasses have a habit of sliding down my occasionally shiny nose. They do feel a bit delicate, though, so I’m trying to handle them with care—despite my occasional klutziness. We’ll see how long they survive the adventure that is my life.  The fit? Spot on for my face, even though they’re smaller than other styles I’ve tried. The arms are a bit stiff to open and close, but maybe they just need to loosen up.  Overall, a great deal for a 3-pack. If (okay, when) I lose or break one, I’ll still have backups ready to jump into action. Win-win!",
