Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with it.  First, the color is not as nice as it appeared in the pictures. I understand that colors can differ, but the difference is not complementary compared to what is shown on the website. Additionally, some of the seams seem to be on the wrong side of the sweater, which gives it a cheap appearance, as if it wasn't assembled properly.  The yarn used to make this sweater is also not soft; it is made from a rough acrylic material that I don’t want against my skin. Furthermore, the sleeves are oddly shaped, causing the sweater to pull awkwardly when I lift or move my arms.  Based on this experience, I would not purchase this sweater again.",

It is barely oversized, and extremely thin. You could not wear this outside on a cold day and expect to be warm.
