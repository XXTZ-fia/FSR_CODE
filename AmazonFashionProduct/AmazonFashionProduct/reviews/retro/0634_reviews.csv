How they have managed to construct well-built, comfortable shades that fit almost every head—and market them at a price that keeps them in business—is a mystery I won't try to solve it.

However, I was recently wearing them when the brown ones literally popped off my face. I thought one of the plastic sides had snapped off, but actually the little screw that holds the earpiece onto the frame popped out. Another woman and I searched endlessly for the tiny screw since I think it just needed to be popped back in. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find it so I have an unwearable pair now. I’m thinking maybe this one was just poorly made?  UPDATE: Previously gave this product a 3-star rating, but I’ve since upgraded my rating to 5 stars based on the seller’s response, which I received the day after I wrote my review. I was informed of their lifetime warranty and was offered either a full refund or a replacement.
