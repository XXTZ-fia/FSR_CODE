This is a decent value for the price, the zipper doesn’t catch and the pockets are large enough to fit your entire hand or a regular phone without risking it falling out. I initially ordered a size up because existing reviews said it ran small. However, what I experienced was that while the sizing was accurate, the fabric has *no* stretch (that’s a different issue in my opinion). If your measurements don’t align with the chart, this is probably not the dress for you. I was right at L measurements but initially ordered an XL because of the prior reviews; the XL was way too big so I returned for a L. The waist was the tiniest bit too loose so the top seam rested slightly on the bust instead of under the bust, where it should be; due to the style, belts did not sit right or solve that problem. After a few months of wearing it as is, I have taken in the waist a bit at each side and the seam now stays under the bust (I am no seamstress, I’m sure there were better ways to solve for this). Word of warning though: the sleeves+non-stretchy fabric would have made it impossible to have full arm mobility if I had taken in anything above the waist.",2

I have almost no confidence in my appearance these days. I was feeling brave and I’m so glad I bought it. This dress is not sexy, it’s feminine. It is well constructed. The fabric is so pretty. It doesn’t have that cheap shiny look. It is actually pretty matte. It’s heavy enough that I am able to wear a full petticoat & steal boning corset without having lines but so soft. The long selves and tea length hemline make me feel pretty without showing too much. I’d still love it even if I was as thin as I used to be. The Only “complaint” I’d have is that I wish it was available in more sizes because it’s such a flattering cut for so many shapes. This is not a stretchy knit so make sure you size correctly. I bought the XL (I fluctuate between 167-172lbs) I could squeeze into it but why do that to myself? So I’m exchanging it for the XXL. I’m just shy of 5’4 and expect I may have to hem the XXL but that’s no trouble to me. I wear 12-14 in pants & med. - large in most tops. The sizing might be slightly off from the measurements provided but not much. Again this is more of a woven fabric, not stretch. I knew I’d be taking a chance with the XL.",23

Although a large would have fit my waist better, I remedied the too big waist, of the XL size, by starching the dress, wearing a petticoat (50s theme party) and adding a belt. I would have liked the dress to be an inch or two shorter, for my height, but I wore the petticoat lower than normal. I washed on gentle cycle cold in the washer, hung dry, then ironed and starched the dress. Cotton starches beautifully. Shrinkage was minimal when washed on cold, even with the high cotton blend.",3

It hold onto wrinkles so tightly that washing in hot water, drying, and ironing it did not remove some of them. Other than the ties at the back, there aren't ways to loosen the dress which is hard because the dress does not stretch. I needed to size up to get into the dress, but there are some weird loose parts by my waist and by my armpits. Pros: It is in fact the exact shame shape as in the picture. I'm 5'3"" and it falls just below my knees. I bought this dress for a funeral and I don't have time to get a different one, so I'm going to use a cardigan to cover the issues.

wininchatsworth,Pretty at first. Bugs. Embroidery unravelling. Consider cost of cleaning. Disliked fabric & fit.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JHVOMF9VI36C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07RY97J4G,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 29, 2023",Size: LargeColor: White 3/4 Sleeves,Verified Purchase,"Headline says it all. Unfortunately, it was returned.  There were two dead bugs in the area between where tulle sits atop the base fabric--one was next to side zipper, the second fell out. Sure, I could have used the tip of a pin to pick out the remaining bug, but I decided to return it.  There were several places where the roses embroidery was unravelling. There were other areas that needed the thread ends to be clipped between the end of one embroidery and beginning of the adjacent embroidery. I didn't do any trimming since I was returning it.  Laundry Instructions: You decide. Instructions recommend hand wash. From prior experience and lessons from junior high school sewing class, when there is tulle connected to a different fabric, it is better to send it to the dry cleaners to preserve its bodice. Dry cleaning costs over time would exceed cost of dress, unless maybe if using a do-it-yourself dry clean product like Dryel.  Fabric: Another You Decide. The shiny fabric (at top and under the tulle) looks and feels like the texture of the old-time underwear slips (aka chemises from the pre-1990's) worn under sheer tops and skirts. The elastic that maintains the off-the-shoulder look reminds me too much of the skinny elastic that stretches out after a few washes--which may be why hand washing is recommended.  Not a good fit. The waist area came to just below the bra instead of at the natural waistline.  Considering there are lots of favorable reviews, my experience may have been a one-off.  You may reach a different conclusion. Currently there is a 'Free Returns' option on this dress.",2
