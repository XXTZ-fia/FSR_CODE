I bought the stripe print hoping the dark stripe would be navy but it is black!  But I loved them so much I am keeping them and will find something else for what I was looking to match.  Also they run large.  I usually wear a XXL but after reading reviews I purchased the XL and I am glad I did.  The XXL I fear would have been falling down and constantly having to pull up.,
