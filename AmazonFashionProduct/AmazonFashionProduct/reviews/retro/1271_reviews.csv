I'll still wear it and it seems well made, but there's not really any ""orange"" or pink there. It's mostly red and black. Some of the reviews said it was a bit big. I'm a 36D, so I took a chance and purchased a medium. It fits nicely without a gap around the bust.",
Karen,Cute top but the one pictured on website is different,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NWNMV0574UCN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8J4J2ZJ,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Floral Red,Verified Purchase,"I want to start by saying. I do like this top. However, if you are like me and want the EXACT same shirt as the picture, you will be slightly disappointed. I feel like this is one of those times that a business see's something they like or is selling good from another business. Takes and uses the other business photo and creates something similar by using it as ""inspiration"". I wish they would post a picture of THEIR actual top that you are buying! I am posting a side by side comparison of the 2. I DID just have mine taking in on the sides by a seamstress (hints the yellow tag in the collar). The sleeves do not sit up at the top, like their picture. The sleeves are not as balloned out above the cuff as their picture. The types of flowers are different. I REALLY liked the tropical flowers in their picture. All in all the shirt is still cute! But it's bit deceiving. And could easily be avoided by posting a picture of the ACTUAL top you are buying. I do like that the buttons are covered, that's a nice touch that they did copy. It's a very light weight top best suited for spring or fall but you can wear it whenever, I am!",2
