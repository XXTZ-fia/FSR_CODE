I felt like it was suffocating me slowly. Every time I moved, it dug into my neck very painfully. Which was unfortunate, because the fit everyone else was GREAT. The material is great, stretchy but not too thin, and it fit like a glove (besides the  awful neck). I wear a size 4, and a size small was absolutely perfect. I would say to get a size small if you are a solid size 4 (you have a size 2 fit a bit tight sometimes,  and the smaller end of a size 6 fits sometimes, but 6 is usually too big for you). But the material does have a bit of give. The sleeves were a bit roomy, but not bad. Also, this is not teal or emerald green if that is what you want- it's more a peter pan green. A dark, stage production of peter pan style green - yuck.  If you want emerald, this is not it, get the other color!",
