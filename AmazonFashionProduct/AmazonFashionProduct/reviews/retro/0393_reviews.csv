It features a relaxed, oversized fit, classic varsity-style design, and zip-up front closure. It's made from lightweight polyester and is perfect for layering or as a light outerwear piece.  The polyester fabric may retain heat, which makes it a bit muggy in warmer weather. The fabric also doesn't have much stretch, do make sure you size up if you need a little wiggle room. The jacket is very thin, so it doesn't provide sufficient insulation for colder weather conditions either.  Overall, this jacket is trendy, stylish, and has a great fit.
