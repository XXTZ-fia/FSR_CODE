SteelersFan,Great Costume shirt; for everyday wear on the cheaper side,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UOK21JXM3AT3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9JY1PH7,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 15, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Light Yellow,,"This review is for the Xlarge size in the light yellow color (flowers/paisleys)  This is a great shirt for a themed night or as part of a costume. It is loud and flashy and will catch everybody's eye. But if you are getting this as an everyday shirt, then I'd probably say keep looking.  First, the size. It is on the bigger side of XL for me. I can go between large and Xl and this one is almost too big for me. I can wear it, but I think that's just because of the print that the size isn't as noticeable. The sleeves are also super ballony, meaning they are way wider than regular sleeves. Plus, the sleeves are a bit long which is surprising on me since most sleeves are usually short. And the collar is very big butterfly. And yes, I understand it's supposed to be retro, but the collar is almost clownish is size. Again, in a costume setting this is icing but for a regular wear, not so much.  The real bit that makes me think of this as a one time type of garment is the material and stitching. The fabric is super thin and feel cheap. I could see my undershirt a little while wearing this. And the stitching is not great. I had to trim several loose threads and am not sure how well the seams will last.  So, as I said in the title, great shirt for a costume or theme night, not so great as a fun colorful shirt for every day.",2

This shirt was an unexpected find. I ordered it in her size, and it fits her perfectly. I love the billowy sleeves. The material is smooth and silky, and it washes well on delicate. The print is bright and crisp. It looks exactly like the pictures in the listing, and not like a slightly blurry photocopy of another shirt like some of these shirts tend to. This shirt fits her style and she is completely thrilled by it.",

Depending on how you style this that can fall on either side of the spectrum. The color is VIBRANT this is not for you guys that love wearing black all day. It’s bold it’s commanding and it will get compliments or confusion depending on how you style this shirt. It’s a little stiff so steaming it may help release the threads a bit but the material is good!,

No way man, this shirt actually fit me and fit me pretty well! I think the only thing that wasn't a great fit was that the cuff was a bit too big but that was easy enough to fix by moving the button about half an inch for a more custom fit. I love the pattern (I got the wavy orange one) and the oversized collar is a real throwback to the clothes my dad wore back in the day. I don't think they used actual vintage patterns, but this is the sort of homage that is well done! The fabric is lightweight, but has a good hand and drape, and feels decent quality. The construction of the garment is top notch, with well matched seams, no loose threads or buttons, and lots of attention to the details like perfectly sewn button holes and properly done top stitching. What's best is that if you need a quality Halloween costume or even a period outfit for a theatrical or movie production, it's a great value!",
