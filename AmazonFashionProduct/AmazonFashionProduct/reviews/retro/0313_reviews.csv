It fits me perfectly, flattering my waistline without feeling tight and allowing me room for the girls without gaping.  The sleeve length is perfect. The fabric is of a substantial enough thickness that there's no show thru (at least not for the light blue color that I got).  The blouse works perfectly with a nice patterned boucle blazer for work.  I have to work a booth at a professional networking event in a couple of days and will be wearing this with confidence.",2
