Deborah White,"Heed the box that states ""Frequently Returned Item.""",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38GDUQL32KIOB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4H4RWW4,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 13, 2024",Color: brown mixed,Verified Purchase,"I bought this wig because this was the total style I was going for as we were going to a Motown Musical. I also thought this would be WAY easier than doing my own hair. What you see in the picture is NOT what came out of the package. These are the instructions: ""Take wig out from the package, shake it lightly to release the default style."" NOT true at all. Out of the package, the flip was under and not up. (The hair color and bouffant part of the wig were great! That's why it gets the 2 stars.) This did not change no matter how many times I shook it. Tried a curling iron to get it to flip up; tried Velcro rollers and hairspray to get it to flip up. Still flipped under. SO DISAPPOINTED with this. A total waste of my money and time. I DO NOT recommend.",
Ellington C.,Decent Wig for 80s Costume but Could Be Better,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3F4KDBN342YG1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C4H4RWW4,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 11, 2024",Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"I recently wore this wig for an 80s-themed Halloween party, and it did the job fairly well. The style of the wig is spot on for that retro look, and it definitely added a fun, nostalgic touch to my costume.  The wig was relatively easy to put on and stayed in place throughout the night, which was a big plus. The bangs and beehive shape were well-constructed, giving it that iconic 80s flair.  However, the quality of the wig could use some improvement. The hair fibers felt a bit stiff and unnatural, which made it look less realistic. It had a very shiny look to it.  Overall, it's a decent option for a costume or themed party, but don't expect it to hold up to regular use or high expectations of realism.",
