KQ,Frames Clash with Blue Lenses,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQFK695IWB457/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6VYG7B4,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 12, 2024",Color: C3 Rose Gold/Light Blue,,"These are probably much nicer with the gold or pink lenses. The frames are a bright (kind of cheap looking) rose gold color. Therefore, the blue lenses clash with the gold frames in a not good way. I bought these to use for a costume, and I don't even think they'll be good enough for that. But...the other color lenses may coordinate with the frames much better.",

Fun.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZ4JJ48YB7QJC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6VYG7B4,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 27, 2024",Color: C5 Gold/Pink,,These are pretty sunglasses that have a real throwback feel. I'm finding lately I really like sunglasses that have lightly tinted lenses. I find they make bright sun tolerable and then I can wear them indoors when going in and out of shops or buildings with comfort. These sunglasses are charming and fun. They look like nice sunglasses because they are.,
