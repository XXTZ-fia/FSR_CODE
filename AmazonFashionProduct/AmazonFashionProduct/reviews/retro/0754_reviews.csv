But really, I got these kind of as a joke - I was seeking a particular ""look"" - and they turned into my favorite pair of sun glasses! I like the tint; it's pretty dark compared to most other sunnies I have, but they're not too dark, so I can still see well when wearing them in the shade.  I also really like the wrap-around feature. One thing that really bugs me about some sunglasses is that I get blinded by the sun rays that reflect off the *inside* of the lenses, either due to direct sun rays from the side/above or that are reflecting off my face. But the way these fit my face, there's really nowhere the sun can get to the back side of the lenses, so I don't have that problem with these.  So let's recap: They're effective. They're comfortable. They're affordable. But most importantly, they're silly enough to remind you that life is just about having fun, but stylish enough to keep you lookin' cool! haha Enjoy!",7
