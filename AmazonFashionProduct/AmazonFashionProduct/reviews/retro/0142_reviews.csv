The material is rather cheap and like a costume, but is not see-thru and was very pretty. The black material for the neckline and halter straps was especially nice. After reading everyone else's warning about the zippers, I just stepped into mine and pulled it up and over my chest.  However - this material has NO GIVE whatsoever. Size carefully and I would size based on your bust size, as the stretch panel in the back does little to help this. I am a bigger girl (145 lbs, G-cup) so I had to buy a 3-X and just deal with the slightly larger waist. I began with a 1-X, but that was a joke.  It is long and came to my knee, and was very flattering. Yes, it is slightly cheaply made, but it is also a great value for how cute it is. I would buy it again.",

I usual wear an XL in the majority of my ordering online. I have DDs and I definitely have a fat belly 😭🤣. But I know when ordering things online sometimes u have to size up. The dress does have a little bit a stretch in the back, and I did not know that. But even though I size up and the dress had some stretch it still fit perfectly!!! I feel like if I would’ve went with a XL instead of a 2X it would’ve been tight even with that little bit of stretch. I may have fit, but it would NOT have been comfortable to wear to a theme park all day long!!! As you can see, the color is perfect!!! The dress was so comfortable, and I got so many compliments!! I would definitely order this dress again!!! Last thing I would say is, give yourself time for the shipping. It took about two weeks. So definitely do not order if you need it in a day or two!!",18
