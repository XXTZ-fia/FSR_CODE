I thought it was fun and I received lots of compliments. I ordered a size small. For reference I am 5'1"", 103 lbs, 34 A chest size. The dress has some stretch to it so it could fit up or down. The belt is usable, but it was folded which left fold marks and it too long for me, even with the adjustable/removable belt loop, so I opted to use a different belt.  I am also wearing a tutu underskirt to give the skirt some fullness. The dress was pretty wrinkled even after hanging it for awhile. I do not recommend this due to the material but I took a risk and I did iron it from the inside using a white dish cloth for an ironing cloth, on a low setting,  and the wrinkles came out pretty well. (I would recommend following the retailers recommendations.) My 4 star rating is due to the sleeves riding up on me and I would have to pull them down quite a few times, and the below average belt and wrinkles. I paired the dress with fake pearls and Mary Jane shoes to compete the look.  Love the fun 50's vibe!",2

I wanted to go more Audrey Hepburn and less swing dance so I thought this was a good fit. Its really nice!  The dress has a lot of stretch but not so much that it loses shape. I am pictured here wearing it over a cheap petticoat and it worked just perfectly. I wore the dress for hours and was never uncomfortable and never felt the need to fidget with it.  Notes- It definitely needed to be steamed before wearing out and about.  I am 5'10 133lbs and wearing a size small.  My only complaint was the belt. As you can see in my 2nd image the belt is clearly made to fit all the sizes. That meant that the extra flap was very very long and stuck out to comic proportions. I clipped it down for the event with a name badge so it wasn't the end of the world.,4

Since I needed to wear the dress the next day, I had to pay $50 to have the zipper replaced which included expedited service. So basically, I paid more for the zipper than what the dress cost me which was really disappointing. That aside, the dress was well-made for the price with the exception of the zipper. I am 5’8 and 158 pounds. I usually wear a small but I sized up and got the medium, which fit perfectly especially since the fabric had great stretch. I wore this dress to a tea party and it was definitely a hit.",3
