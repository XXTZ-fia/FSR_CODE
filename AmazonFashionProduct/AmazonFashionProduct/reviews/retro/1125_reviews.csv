BuzzyQBee,pretty vintage but side zipper gets stuck,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUZUJGFCWIGDV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNJCR12J,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Color: ButterflySize: Small,,My daughter finds this vintage butterfly dress comfortable. Love the mix of black lace with the nude-khaki skirt and smooth black top. The size Small's a good fit on her petite rectangular figure that wears a size Small or 4-6 in dresses. The black top & skirted bottom defines her waist more. Very pretty. She wears this with flat black ballet shoes to complete the look.  Greatly recommended.,
Mom of 9,"Cute, not super high quality",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWG7YBJ3HAYGX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNJCR12J,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Color: ButterflySize: Small,,"This was a great dress for my 13yo who loves vintage and fancy dresses. You should know that the waist is quite high, and it has a wide cut that looks awkward without the belt. It fits her very well (she is tall and thin), but I think it wouldn't be a great cut for anyone large-busted. She says it's very comfortable for her, though!  The fabric itself is pretty thin. It tore the first day she wore it, although she was being a bit rough, crawling on the floor to retrieve a Christmas present from under the tree. Luckily she sews and it tore in a place that was easily mendable. She likes it enough that it was worth it for her!",
Chantel Dominique,It was missing the ribbon !,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23YMRDEQBC09C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNJCR12J,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2024",Color: ButterflySize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,The top was laying on my midriff instead of my waist. Ribbon missing that was shown on the photo. Not worth the price. I would pay less than $24 Pregnant so bought XL.,2
