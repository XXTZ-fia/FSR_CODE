Honestly, other sunglasses I've purchased off Amazon for $5-$10 more were of significantly higher quality. I wouldn't expect these to be as durable as the $25ish sunglasses.  That having been said, they do look/fit great, and while the lenses may be cheap plastic, they're also very clear with no hint of distortion.  I got these for a vacation trip where I know there's a decent chance they'll be lost or damaged, so they're nice enough to make me look cool, but also cheap enough that I won't be crushed if anything happens to them.",4

I ordered these in Feb of 2024 and they were perfect for what I wanted. Stylish, comfortable and I love purple! I went with the matte ones as the gray and purple looked great together. The rubber-like coating was nice for about 2/3 months, now they are sticky! I tried to clean them but it just made it worse, leaving lint behind. I would expect this from a coating that was YEARS old, not a few months. It's disappointing as they are comfortable and have so many color combos, but sadly the finish is just cheap.",2
