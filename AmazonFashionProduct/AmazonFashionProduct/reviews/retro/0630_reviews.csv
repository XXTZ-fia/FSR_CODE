Person with weight 115 lb, waist 28"" bust 34"" should have fit this perfectly based on the size chart but it was too tight at waist and bust even with mimimal bra padding and the material shows stretch marks at waist and bust. Also material doesn't iron well and leaves shiny spots unless you iron it inside out or use a sheet on top and the bust and sleeves can't be ironed well with a sheet on top or inside out as there is a inner layer of material that requires lower temperature iron on inside while outer layer requires hotter temperature than inner layer to iron. It has to be ironed as it comes wrinkled and wrinkles easily.  It comes with a separate belt that you can make into a bow.",4
