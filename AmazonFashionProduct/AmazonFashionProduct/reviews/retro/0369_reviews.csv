Lady P,Funky and Fabulous: My New Favorite Sunglasses!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NWHPOXX2XKMO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5YPBD8Y,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 15, 2024",Color: A3 Light Green / Grey LensLens Width: 55 Millimeters,,"As someone who's always rocked oversized glasses, I was a bit hesitant to try the trendy smaller lenses. But when I spotted these cute olive-green acetate frames with dark black lenses, I couldn't resist. I'm glad I took the plunge!  The Look These sunglasses are giving me major 1950s vintage vibes, and I'm here for it! The funky olive-green color is unique and eye-catching (though it's a bit tricky to capture in photos). I feel like they'd complement almost any face shape, adding a touch of retro cool to any outfit.  Comfort and Function I was pleasantly surprised by how lightweight these frames are. Despite their sturdy acetate construction, they don't weigh me down at all. I was initially concerned that the smaller lenses might let in more sun from the top and sides, but they fit snugly against my face, blocking out glare effectively.  Quality Even though I own some high-end sunglasses, I find myself reaching for these more often than not. The lenses are nice and dark, perfect for bright sunny days. I also put them to the polarization test by looking at my LCD TV while rotating the glasses. Sure enough, at 90-degree angles, the screen went black – a clear sign that these are indeed polarized as advertised.  Overall Impression I'm struggling to find any negatives about these sunglasses. They're stylish, comfortable, functional, and seem well-made. While I can't predict how others might feel about them, I can say that for me, they've quickly become a go-to accessory. If you're on the fence about trying a smaller lens style, I'd say give these a shot. They might just become your new favorites too!  5/5 stars from me!",
ABMN,"Ok, but not the style for round/large faces",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FXL0C20WSUO9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5YPBD8Y,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 5, 2024",Color: A4 Beige / Brown LensLens Width: 55 Millimeters,,"I got the beige ones with brown lenses.  They look good in the product photos but less good in person, a lot more boring in real life in my opinion.  The shape of these is not ideal for larger faces, as they just seem disproportionately short on a rounder/bigger face.  Too bad, they have a classic shape, they just are kinda meh in person.",
