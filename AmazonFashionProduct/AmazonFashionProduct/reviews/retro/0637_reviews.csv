Ivy,Went above my expectations,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C45VO6U43P5F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D45JMZQ8,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 25, 2024",Size: X-SmallColor: Orange,Verified Purchase,"For the fabric, it was surprisingly warm. The sleeves are like big blankets. I was totally expecting them to be uncomfortable too, but the length was easy to manage throughout the day. It does tend to gap around the chest, especially when bending or hunching  your shoulder, but that could be fixed by buying a smaller size or using fashion tape/glue. Overall, worth the purchase.",
Luusaki,Loved and fit great!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REZY2QL7L277X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D45JMZQ8,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 11, 2024",Size: X-SmallColor: Orange,Verified Purchase,"I got pretty nervous about the fit, but it fit great as an X-small, 5'4"", 112lbs.  The blouse looked exactly like the picture, and the fabric, though probably a cheap fabric, was smooth and soft. The bell sleeves are huge and so fun exactly what I wanted.",
