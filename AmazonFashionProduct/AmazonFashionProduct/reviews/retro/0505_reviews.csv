What arrived were two completely different fabrics/colors.  Both were pink/orange, but the medium was much darker and more of a cotton-stretch material.  The large, which is the one I kept, is a more peachy color and is more of a polyester-stretch type material.  The one I kept is heavier weight and has a better drape to it, in my opinion. The waist was a tad big on the large, but the belt held it in place just fine. I got the scarf, tee-shirt, belt and glasses from Amazon too.  Very pleased with my purchases.",6
