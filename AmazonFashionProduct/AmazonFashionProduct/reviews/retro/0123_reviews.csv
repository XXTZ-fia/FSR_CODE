Fabric has good stretch, so take that into consideration when picking out your size. I got a medium because my limiting dimension was my waist, but I should have really gotten a small to better fit the bust area (I'm small busted relative to my other dimensions). I feel the dress would have stretched to fit my waist and fit my bust more snug.  The skirt portion is awesome, I wore it with a petticoat to fill it out (and keep me warm).  I absolutely loved the capelet, but be forewarned, it likes to spin around if you are someone who moves a lot. I had friends constantly adjusting it for me to keep it straight.  I feel like this is now my go to black dress for all types of event!",11

The dress has stretch to it so sizing is really easy/flexible but it was true to size. It was so comfortable and hugged all the right spots for a really nice fitted look without being uncomfortable or showing off any problem areas. I never get dresses this awesome or fit so well when I shop online - definitely a dress lottery moment there. The dress is perfect as-is, but would also look great if you wanted something casual without the cape and it is not attached. Would go great with a petticoat under it too, but it had enough flare for me without. I ordered red and it is a perfect red, not washed out in an orange hue or anything. I think this is my new favorite dress.",5

I honestly didn't have high hopes considering Amazon seems to be carrying very cheaply made items at pretty high prices, but I'm so glad I took a chance on this dress. The dress is flattering and different in appearance from anything I have seen in department stores lately. I received many compliments while wearing it, I just adore it. My only complaint is the material. It's a real *pita* to get the wrinkles out of. I used an iron and a pressing cloth to remove the DEEP wrinkles this dress arrived with which took forever and then wanted to scream later on in the evening when I realized the dress had wrinkled just from the way I sat and bent in it throughout the night. So, it's a fussy dress due to the cheap material. It doesn't look cheap on though, don't let it deter you from purchasing.",2
