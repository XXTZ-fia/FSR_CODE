I was originally going to buy one (red) but was impulsive and bought 2 (black/grey).  I was pleasantly surprised by the heaviness of the sweater- I thought it was going to be much lighter.  They are lovely and look well made BUT, they are not true to size (for me).  I'm 5'3"", 120 lbs and bought medium, which is my true size (in fact I sometimes have to get small for certain things).  Both sweaters were very tight, where the front is kind of puckered and gaps between the buttons.  I look like a sausage stuffed into a small casing!  I had checked the sizing guide which put me in a small-medium category.  Then I laid them out on my bed, with one sweater over the other and the black sweater was noticeably smaller than the red one.  They're both a medium, so not impressed with the consistency of the sizing.  I was considering returning but I've gotten burned on that before by Amazon where I wasn't refunded after sending back my product.  I'm trying to wash them and stretch them out while they're wet but I'm not pleased.  These aren't cheap sweaters where you hope to get one season out of them.  Like I said, they're lovely so if you decide to purchase, I'd SIZE UP!!",

Looks like pink fuzz from the rest of the sweater is on the white but its not fuzz. Anyone who sees sweater can definitely tell it bled and will know sweater is cheap product.  Can't understand how so many people could buy this product if the colors bleed. I really like the material, weight, fit. Since I packed it away...too late to return. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! Not sure if it is just the red sweater. Reds are known to bleed if dyes and fabric are cheap etc, but this sweater has such great reviews. Maybe I got a bad batch? Now two years later looking for argyle and came across this product. NEED to write review wondering if this happened to anyone else who bought red argyle.",5

It's fitted, but not snug, if you wore it with mid-rise jeans it would hit maybe midway down the zipper, and the sleeves don't stop at my wrist bone! They reach a tiny bit past where hand and wrist meet. It's a heavier material and will be so perfect for winter.",13
