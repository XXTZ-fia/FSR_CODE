It’s been colder this winter and my feet are freezing in my Colton socks. I was hesitant to buy socks with wool in them as that wool socks were itchy and scratchy. I’m living my new socks, they are so warm and comfy. And I wear a size 5.  So I was worried they would be too long.  I washed them in hot water, dried them on high heat. They shrunk to fit almost perfectly.  I would say that anyone with smaller feet would be able to shrink these to fit.  Otherwise wash them in cold if you don’t wear a smaller size.  They are great socks for the price",

Quality is not as good as past years and doesn't provide as much comfort in my boots. I think there is less wool in them too if any at all. They feel different, smooth, and i can see through parts of them. Good light socks, but not the thick i was expecting. The last time was 5 stars.

Trying to find medium-weight wool socks that are warm without being too bulky. Harder than one would think, many sellers offer the exactly same socks under various brandnames.  STYLES PURCHASED: Loritta Design Style Warm (this listing) very loose knitting, not warm, see-trough when stretched, NO reinforced heels and toes. Returned. Loritta Multicolor 08n (this listing)very cute and the multicolored pattern knitting makes them thicker, but unfortunately that doesn’t apply to heels and toes, here they are very thin and see-through, can see my toes, NO reinforced heels and toes. Returned. Loritta Retro StyleZ (this listing) loose knitting, overall thin, didn’t even open the package, Returned. Loritta Multicolored(thickened) https://a.co/d/b2I2mdz these are good, and I would only recommend buying the styles that have “thickened” in the name. Not too thick, not too thin, but unfortunately had some knitting irregularities, maybe just a bad lot? Returned.  I’m still looking, I sure like Falke Walkie light and Falke TK2 and similar, but was trying to find something less expensive, as I need a bunch. Loritta socks and comparable are not worth it in my opinion (except the “thickened” styles maybe). It would be nice if they would switch to tighter knitting and reinforced heels and toes. I would rather just get 3 pairs instead of 5 pairs, but better quality.",

The bad: almost everything in the listing title is incorrect. These are socks and they are crew lengtht. But they are not warm winter thick soft cozy socks. I also have serious doubts about wool content.  The socks are shrink-wrapped. OK. Fair enough. According to the package instructions: ""The product you receive may be squeezed and you can restore fluffy state by hand washing.""  Nope. The cuffs managed to 'fluff' up a bit, but the rest of the sock remained flat - also stretched out of shape. Also note: ""Hand wash."" The ad says machine wash, but I have my doubts that the socks would survive more than one or two washes. One of the socks that I hand-washed developed a notable hole in the knit.  About the fibre content: honestly, these feel most like cheap cotton socks. I can feel every weave on the bottom of my feet. Annoying and uncomfortable. Not soft. Not in any universe would these be soft.  Basically, these are cheap, thin, rough, cotton socks. I have absolutely zero confidence in the durability of these socks beyond one wearing. I can't tell you for certain, though, because they are just too uncomfortable to wear even once.  Save your money.  * I know I sound cranky. Sorry.
