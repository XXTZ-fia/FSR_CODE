If you're short legs with a long torso like me, there's just no way. It's a bummer because I really like the style! Getting a bigger size would be too much room in the top and lose support.

It combines the coverage of a bodysuit with the functionality of a swimsuit, making it perfect for beach trips. I chose this style specifically to address concerns about sagging in the lower area and to cover my inner thighs, and it exceeded my expectations.  The design effectively hides problem areas while providing excellent coverage, allowing me to enjoy the beach with confidence. I was initially worried about the swimsuit riding up in the front while walking, but it stayed in place perfectly.  If you’re looking for swimwear that offers great coverage and comfort, I highly recommend this option. It’s a great solution for anyone looking to feel confident and stylish at the beach.",

So nice to have my rear end covered, and as a plus you don't have to worry about shaving your bikini line. I am 5'7"" and 136 lbs and normally wear a size 6, but am fairly busty, so I purchased a medium. If I had a smaller chest, a small would probably be a slightly better fit on me.

It has a stretch around the legs and the middle in the material, doesn't ride up in the legs, and the tie straps do not come untied. The only thing that I wish was the torso was a bit longer or that it had more of vertical stretch ability.
