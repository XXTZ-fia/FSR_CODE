A Customer,I think I got something different from what I ordered,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WHH047HJKD0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4LYJW12,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 26, 2025",Color: Brown,,"The wig itself is of decent quality.  However, some strands of ""hair"" did fall out.  It does feel kind of real but at the same time a plastic based wig.  It comes with all of the stuff you need to really put a wig on.  It also feels different from what I ordered because of the style looking a lot like the other one.  I ordered the ""brown"" but got the ""brown-30"" maybe.  That's the style I got.  The back looks flat on my head.It also looks and feels disheveled from what it's supposed to be.  But I quickly fixed that.  Either way, for what I ordered, it feels mid tier because of how flat the back looks to me.",
