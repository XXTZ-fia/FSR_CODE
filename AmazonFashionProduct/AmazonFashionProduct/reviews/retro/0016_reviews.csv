Didn't sinch me in the way I expect from a bodysuit. Also you won't get the cleavage from the pic, and it's backless so you can't wear a pushup bra.  Bought it for a The Substance Halloween costume and it did the trick.",

Debra,Great for 80s themed workout!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21QQ8S2G111SD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07437MPP6,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 9, 2024",Size: SmallColor: 80s White Letter,Verified Purchase,"I initially purchased this suit in pink but when I opened the package there was an inch long tear in the seam on the left side so I returned it and got the blue one, which was not damaged. (I needed it ASAP and the pink one would not have arrived in time.) I used it for an 80s themed workout at our gym and it was perfect for the aesthetic.  This is a bathing suit and not a leotard, so the fabric was lined and a little thicker than I expected. The top is padded but not too much. It helped with shaping and made it so that I didn’t have to wear a bra (although my friend who is more endowed than I am wore the same suit and needed to add a bra — it still looked great even with the bra). The back is open and the butt coverage is reasonable: a little cheeky but not anything like the typical 80s leotard thong. I wore leggings underneath and it didn’t look bulky and the seams didn’t show through.  My only complaint is that the straps were prone to slipping but I did complete an hour long HIIT workout and it didn’t fall off, so that’s a win! I got pretty sweaty during the workout but very little sweat showed through the suit.  I got a size small and it was perfect. I’m 5’8”, 135lbs and an A cup.  I would have given a 4.5 star rating if I could since the only real issue was the initial tear and the straps.",

The cut of the neckline is super flattering and the suit compression pushes the girls in and up so that they get a boost without looking like you are popping or spilling out. I feel secure as a C/D cup. Shoulder straps stay put.  Back has a nice depth. The high cut thigh makes my legs look long and the back cheeky in fun way.
