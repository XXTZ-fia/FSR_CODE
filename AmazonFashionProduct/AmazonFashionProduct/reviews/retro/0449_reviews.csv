The style, the length, the colors and patterns, everything was fantastic.  So when I got a notification about their another dress had a deal, I immediately placed an order. I got the blue-yellow floral this time because I thought the combination of those colors is so unique and fun. When I tried it on, the fit felt different, especially the chest area. It felt bigger and I didn’t feel comfortable bending over to pick up something in it.  So I compared it with my first dress, and it turned out that the chest area for this blue-yellow dress was about 2” bigger, as you can see in my photos. Ugh… I’m not sure why the same size differs this much, but I was absolutely heartbroken because I LOVE the dress! But it’s going to cost about the same to take it to the alterations, so I returned the second dress. I'm super disappointed.  By the way, I’m 5/6” and about 160 lb, usually wear XL for most of the clothes, including dresses like those. The first one fits me perfectly, but not the second one.

I have a small bust and was worried that it might not fit, but I'm glad I took the chance. It fits like a glove and looks incredible. I am 5'4"" and 120 lbs. I got size small. The fabric feels a little more synthetic than I would like, but it came out of the bag without a single wrinkle AND has a built in slip and lining. So, I can overlook the synthetic feel of the fabric. This was well worth the money. I will be buying more from this company in rhe future.",
