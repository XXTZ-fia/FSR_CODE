Chris,90’s nostalgia in the perfect shade,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2N6MKI0DFC1VF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJQDR49D,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",,,"This 3 pack of sunglasses is a great deal! I got them for my wife and she loves them!  Her thoughts of them: They come in three different colors, so there is a pair for any outfit. They are a smaller frame which I was concerned about, but I get so many compliments! The sunglasses come in black with a dark lens, dark tortoise brown paired with a dark brown lens, and a lighter amber tortoise and lighter lens. They are comfortable to wear and have a good quality feel to them.  If you are looking for the 90’s aesthetic look no further.",

Amazon Customer,Cute and great value,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DQLVSY1S0R6N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJQDR49D,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Color: 3pack-black+tortoise Brown+tortoise GreenLens Width: 53 Millimeters,,"I like these glasses, they fit really well and feel high quality. 3 pairs plus a carrying bag and cleaning cloth for $20 is a great deal. They look trendy and since the pack has black and brown they go with a lot of different outfits. Like other reviews say I’m not sure if they’re polarized, but the lenses are darker than I expected, so I really like that.  They seem pretty durable and came packaged really well. I would definitely recommend this brand for these and different styles.",
A Customer,Not just for small faces,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YBITLB2DIH5K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJQDR49D,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 2, 2025",,,"I would say I have a bigger than average face with a sharp, square jawline, my face is definitely not small. They fit fine on me and look fine. The oval shape would actually flatter pretty much all face shapes, I really can't think of a face shape this wouldn't work with.  Construction and quality is really excellent for its price category. I ordered 10+ single sunglasses costing under $20 each and I honestly cannot tell the difference between the batch sunglasses here and the single ones other sellers sell for $15 each. They feel quite simiilar in quality.  Color wise this set is gorgeous. I have dark brown to black hair so I appreciate having a choice. Love having the light colored pair so I can pair with my all white or beige outfits. Sometimes, black just looks too serious and out of place.  The only thing to note is that I do not believe these are polarized. Hence is probably the major difference. They are fashionable and great looking and protect you from the sun, but won't help you driving under strong afternoon glare.",
hjh,"Trendy? Yeah in the 90s, maybe, but thats okay.....",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJS5PHP3C61MQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJQDR49D,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 24, 2024",,,"My mother~in~law had a pair like this she has had since the 90s probably. She boke hers the other day and was heartbroken. She said all she could find were the Jackie~O style or the Elton John swallow up your whole face clown sunglasses~! LOL~! I was so happy to see these, a 3 pack even~! They are not polarized but they still work exceptionally well. She said she didnt even care as long as they dont make her look dumb. Oh my goodness she's so funny~! They are comfortable, lightweight on the face, and have the built in nose piece, one less thing to have to worry about. For this price you cant go wrong.~! She was very happy~! RECOMMENDED~!",
Wildcatmama2,Good quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DXM1JQP14V0K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJQDR49D,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 16, 2024",Color: 3pack-black+tortoise Brown+tortoise GreenLens Width: 53 Millimeters,,Good quality. well made look very cute on.

JJ Christensen,extremely well priced,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R5R10I50G0WG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJQDR49D,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 9, 2024",,,"Sunglasses is all about stylistic choice, unless of course you are hard edged on how well they actually block the sun ;)  I love tinted lenses and these styles of sunglasses that remind me of the 90s. They sit well on my wide face and I will test them out in the sun to see how they work protecting me from UV rays.  If there are issues with actual shading, I will come back and write another review. For now, I would recommend enthusiastically!  These are priced extremely well!!! What a steal - $20 for three sets fashionable glasses! I don't think you can get glasses like these in other retail stores for less even back in the 90s!",
