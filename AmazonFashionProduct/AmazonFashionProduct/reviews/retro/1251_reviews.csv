Fabric is thick, sits nicely. Looks quality. It does wrinkle a bit easier, but just starch it a touch it’ll be fine. I bought the poofy slip for underneath and it really completed the look. Modest yet sexy. Good bang for your buck. No pockets, is not see through, and functions as needed (twirling and looking gorg). Highly recommend!",7
