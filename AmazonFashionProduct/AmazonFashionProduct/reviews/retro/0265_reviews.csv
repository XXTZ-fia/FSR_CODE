I loved the style and they are lightweight but feel durable and the best part is they're pretty affordable. However, I'm head is way too big for these. They look like child glasses on me.

Deuce & Coco,Excellent sunglasses,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24V4VH4Z3DCJM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D93JFBGH,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 16, 2024",Color: Gold/Brown,,"Sojos is a brand I have grown to love and these sunglasses did not change that opinion. They are excellent, as expected, and are very sturdy.  I appreciate the pouch that comes with them to protect the sunglasses. I am such a fan of this brand and I have yet to have a bad pair from them, regardless of style. They are a high quality brand for not a lot of money. Highly recommend to anyone!",

Dobeman,"Dark lenses, but not held together well",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TXF80OPIWW50/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D93JFBGH,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 5, 2024",Color: Gold/Grey,,"In the video I've included you can see the comparison of these aviator style sunglasses against a famous name brand. These stack up as ""meh."" Rather than having any sort of wrap around contour, they are just straight a car off which looks and feels a little weird. The lenses are very dark and have very good polarization. But, when you clean the lenses they move around inside the frame instead of being tightly fit. That's a quality problem. They do have a metal frame although it's not quite as solid as the others. They're a little lighter then the famous brand so they're comfortable. All in all, they're ok",
Witchy,Almost Perfect,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3C5BSDSCAF3PP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D93JFBGH,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 2, 2024",Color: Gold/Brown,,"Polarized, as described. They fit well and look good.  The only 'downside' (albeit they are under $20!) is that the gold around the rim/of the frames is a pretty thick line and the gold looks cheap, almost like it's not metal and really detracts from what should be a stellar pair of sunglasses!",3
M.D.,Great quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROOIL1LODGD7W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D93JFBGH,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2024",Color: Gold/Brown,,These look designer. Made well. Runs large so keep in mind this will be an oversized look if you have a smaller face,
Rk Star,They fit great,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UYF5IOE7TRAF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D93JFBGH,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 25, 2024",Color: Gold/Grey,,These glasses fit great on my face and I love the overall style but the only reason I deducted a star is because the gold is a little too much. It doesn't look as bold on the photos but it's a little more than I anticipated. I absolutely love the style though. I might need to look for a different color because the style is great,
Alejandro E.,Well made fun sunnies,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E6ZF30KRZFOP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D93JFBGH,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 22, 2024",Color: Gold/Brown,,"These feel solidly built and have a fun, refined look to them. They're comfortable to wear and I like how the brown lenses make the world look on dreary, cloudy days. The size works for all kinds of head sizes and face shapes. Would definitely recommend if you like this look!",
