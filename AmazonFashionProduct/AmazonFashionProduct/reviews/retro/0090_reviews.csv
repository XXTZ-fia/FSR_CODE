The length was perfect right below my knee, so I didn’t have to hem it. I liked it so much I’m buying it in various colors for every season.  I know it says you can wash it, but I won’t. Instead, I’ll dry clean it.  I love that it has a V neck both on front and back. I am 5’3” and weigh 163. I normally wear a Size12/14 or a L/XL. I bought both the XL and it hugged my lower half.

The fabric is semi-elastic and highlights exactly what you want to highlight. The collar is lined and wide. It is not glued in the center. You can easily shape your cufflinks and adapt it to your taste. I don't like to show much but it makes you feel divine. The bottom is slightly transparent but not too much. The dress weighs nothing, is comfortable and light. The fabric is resistant. Quality finishes, nothing tight; I recommend that you buy a larger size. I am 1.56 centimeters tall and weigh 84 kilos. I normally wear size L but I ordered an XL and it was the best. I recommend that you order a size larger than what you wear. I will order more in different colors.",16
