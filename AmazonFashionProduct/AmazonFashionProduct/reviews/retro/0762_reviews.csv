That was my fault for not reading that they’re thin, and they really mean it! These are super lightweight, so don’t expect any warmth from them.  That being said, they are adorable and arrived beautifully packaged in a stylish little box. They’re long enough to wear with boots, don’t make your feet sweat or overheat, and are just really comfy for warm weather or layering with shoes/boots.  Overall, they’re very cute, stylish, and comfortable, just don’t expect any type of warmth. Highly recommend if you want stylish and lightweight socks.  Pros: - Adorable retro design - Lightweight & breathable --great for warm weather - Comfortable & stretchy --easy to wear all day - Long enough for boots --perfect for layering - Cute packaging  Cons: - Not ideal for cold weather",

They are lightweight, breathable and comfortable to wear, even on days like today with the heat index over 100°. The HUGSWEET one size fits all socks work even on my size 9 feet. The fabric is stretched thinner over my heel and big toe but that's a given with women's socks on my big feet. I especially like that the tops of the socks are non-binding. Just wish the socks were a couple of inches longer because white socks are my first line of defense against fire ants, fleas and ticks while working outside (I live in rural Florida). When the socks are laundered, I will flat dry them rather than use the dryer in an effort to reduce the chance of shrinkage and prolong the life of the fibers.",

To start, these aren't thick socks - they're thin, and comfortable in any sneaker. Also, they're not tall - they're mid-calf length. They look small when you 1st see them, but the fit me nicely and I wear women's US size 9. I like the colors and think they're a nice modern take on the athletic sock look.",2
