Amaechi O.,Fun and Retro Bowling Shirt for Summer Vibes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LNRCT9YLH3VF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDXZ5QLD,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 25, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Green White,,"I recently bought the COOFANDY Men's Vintage Bowling Shirt for those laid-back summer days, and it's a solid choice for a casual, retro look.  Fit and Style: 4/5  The shirt fits true to size, which is a relief when shopping online. The vintage design and Cuban collar give off a cool, relaxed vibe that's perfect for beach outings or backyard BBQs.  Quality Concerns: 3/5  While the style is spot-on, the quality could be better. The fabric feels a bit thin, and I'm not sure how well it will hold up after a few washes. It's decent for the price, but don't expect top-notch durability.  Overall Comfort: 4/5  It's comfortable to wear, especially in warm weather. The breathable fabric and short sleeves keep me cool, making it a go-to choice for hot summer days.  Conclusion:  If you're looking for a stylish, true-to-size bowling shirt with a vintage flair, this COOFANDY option delivers. Just be aware that the quality might not be top-tier, but it's definitely a fun addition to your summer wardrobe.",
