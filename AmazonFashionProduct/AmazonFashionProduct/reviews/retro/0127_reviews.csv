It is of a satin  material, and there are no loose threads, and the buttons are sewn on tightly. I am 5 foot four, and it is the perfect length for me. The cuffs are always a little loose at the wrist from all companies, so I just put a rubber band around the top to make the sleeves even more flattering.",2
