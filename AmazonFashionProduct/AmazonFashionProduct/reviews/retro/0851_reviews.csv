Each time I wear one of these vintage-style shirts, I find myself receiving compliments from friends and strangers alike, which speaks volumes about their appeal.  What I appreciate most about these shirts is the fit; they strike a perfect balance between comfort and style, making them suitable for both casual outings and slightly dressier occasions. The short sleeves allow for breathability, especially during warmer months, while the button-down design adds a touch of classic sophistication.  Additionally, the material used in these shirts is another standout feature. They resist wrinkling remarkably well, so I don’t have to worry about looking disheveled after a long day. When I do need to give them a quick touch-up with an iron, they respond beautifully, becoming crisp and fresh with minimal effort.  Overall, the COOFANDY Men's Casual Vintage Bowling Shirts have quickly become staples in my wardrobe, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to add some stylish yet practical options to their collection. The combination of quality, fit, and timeless design makes these shirts a worthwhile investment.",

The poppy red and white color combination is a classic, and the short sleeves and breathable fabric make it perfect for summer. Whether I'm hitting the lanes or just strolling down the boardwalk, this shirt always gets compliments.  What I love most about Coofandy is their attention to detail.

Plus, it's incredibly comfortable to wear, thanks to the lightweight and breathable material.

I have found, because many of their shirts are made for muscular builds, that I need to order one size down or else it is too baggy or the hem is too long.Coofandy continues to impress with their latest line of “bowling” shirts.  This one is an instant standout, particularly for those who appreciate the “what’s old is new again” motto.  The craftsmanship of the shirt is what I typically receive from Coofandy.  Attention to detail is evident in the stitching quality.  The fabric is very soft and light enough to wear on warm days.  I normally order a large, but as in my opening paragraph, sometimes I need to size down to a medium.  I’m glad I did for this one because the dimensions are spot on for my physique.  As with most Coofandy shirts, there are no collar stays.  That is fine because the fabric holds up well wash after wash without wrinkling.  An extra button is included.This shirt has a lot of sheen.  Sometimes sheen can really enhance a shirt, depending on the style.  However, for this design, I think it’s a little much.  I would give this a five-star recommendation if they toned it down.

This is an easy-to-care for shirt and comes with one extra button. It appears to be sewn nicely and is a bit loose-fitting, though I would say this fits true-to-size, as my guy can wear between a small to medium in normal clothes and this is a medium.  I deducted one star for this reason only . . . it's mostly Polyester (96%) with 4% Spandex. While this may not be an issue for you, I just wanted to point that out. I would always prefer a larger natural fiber content such as Cotton or Bamboo over Polyester due to ""breathability.""  The care instructions mention that it is best to not tumble dry, though I don't quite know why since this is polyester for the most part. I think you can machine wash warm and tumble dry on low to medium heat, which is what I will be doing. If anything goes awry after doing so, I will be sure to update this review. But I have machine washed and dried many polyester fabrics over the years and have found no problems with shrinking or anything else, so I would expect this fabric to be able to handle it.  Overall, it's a good-looking button-down, ""bowling"" style shirt and should pack well if traveling.",

Design - this is a purely objective call, but I really like the design. The look, colors are just as it shows on the web page & so I rate it @ 4.5/5.  Quality - fabric quality is good but not great. The fabric is very thin & that's probably great for summers but it can get too breazy & cold @ nights. So I rate this a 4 since this is really a summer shirt.  Workmanship - is just ok as there are areas where the seams shows if you look carefully (see photos) but it's not very obvious and so i rate it 4.  Fit - I usually wear a medium & sometimes large but when ordering online, I always go with the large size and I'm glad that I did with this one since even the ""large"" seem a little tight. So i rate this 3.5  Maintenance - I haven't had this for a long time but so how long will this last remains unknown. As for ironing/steaming, you most probably will need to at least steam it after wash. It took me a while to get all the creases & wrinkles out with a steamer but that was because it came in a vacuum sealed packaging so hopefully it wont be as bad after a wash. For this I rate it a 4  Overall, this is a very light, comfortable casual shirt you would want to wear in summer. it's stylish and the design and the colors are just as it looks in the ad.",
