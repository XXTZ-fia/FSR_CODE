I have an athletic build; 6ft, 210-213, 48in chest, 32in waist, and the shirt fit well across my body. It’s form fitting but still has room to stretch in the chest and arms and it tapers well through the abdomen. My only complaint is the color. It’s beige but appears more yellow in some areas than others. Hopefully a few wash cycles will even things out. Even so, it still matches nicely with my white linen pants and navy chino shorts.  Overall, this is a good inexpensive addition to the wardrobe if looking for a lightweight Summer “old money” aesthetic. I like this shirt with the white linen pants and a pair of light brown Birkenstocks or dressed up a bit with navy chino shorts and a tan driving loafer.",
