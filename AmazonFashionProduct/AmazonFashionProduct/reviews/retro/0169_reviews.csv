I have a small face, so I was skeptical that these would work for me, but they fit beautifully.  I originally bought them in black. and I liked them so well in black that I ended up buying a second pair in black, and I also bought them in tan and in white. They're GREAT sunglasses and I receive compliments on them every time I wear them. The black framed glasses have super dark lenses, which are great in bright sunlight; the tan and white framed glasses have more lightly tinted lenses. These look like designer sunglasses. I love them and highly recommend them.",

Claire B.,Four stars for the uneven coloring but glasses are VERY GOOD overall.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD8WHFWEC7Y1P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CXPVKYTS,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 28, 2024",Color: C2 Tortoise/Grey,Verified Purchase,"I would say that the problem I faced does not apply to white or black probably because it seems specific to my pair of tortoise shell one.  What happens is that the left side of the glasses look much lighter then the right side as you look at the person wearing them.  I do't know what causes it but clearly they look like made of two different tones of the plastic.  I will order another pair to see if I get more luck to get evenly shaded glasses.  Overall they are amazing because they are very thick not thin cheap plastic. they feel like very expenisve glasess.  The fit just right on average head but my friend with slightly wider face said they are kind of tight. So this may be something to consider for person with wider face as I personally do not like tight sunglasses so if t hat was the case I could not wear them.  Returning to try better pair now. Overall I highly recommend them, they truly look classy and expensive.",

Qualitywise, these are great for a great price- solid construction, nice fit, not flimsy or crooked at all.  It comes with a bright carry case even and a cleaning cloth.  This is a NICE pair of fun ""cheap"" sunglasses.  That said, this pair felt like a slightly NICER pair of glasses than I would've picked up in 1995 at a Maurices or from a Delias catalogue.  I don't think I've ever owned a pair of cheap ""clout goggles"" that wasn't slightly crooked in any way haha.  So if you want a little retro fun to spice up the wardrobe, I HIGHLY recommend these.Fitwise, I have a longer narrow face and I probably would've passed on these if I tried them on in the store but only because they felt a little wide for my long narrow face.  I am middle aged, and while they capture the vibe of 1995, I won't lie and say I did get a bit of the ""wonkavision"" look when i checked myself out in them.  I let my daughter try them.  She has a more round face, and she felt that the size of them covered her eyebrows too much and she felt like an egg in them.  I thought she looked cute as a button, but she had issues with them covering her brows up.  Of course the look of these on your face is subjective, but these are a nice pair of fun glasses!",

The frames are sturdy and thick and should hold up well over time.  The oval lenses give them a retro-vibe look. The sunglasses also come with a cleaning cloth and a bright yellow carrying case.  The carrying case is a little cheap looking in my opinion but will still do the job of protecting your sunglasses.  All in all, for the price, I think they are a well-made and fun pair of sunglasses to sport during the summer.HAPPY SHOPPING!",2

I love the pale mocha color of the plastic. The color is an unusual shade that I haven't seen too much of elsewhere. It is a very basic neutral that can harmonize with a broad spectrum of colors (especially blacks, whites and earth tones). It will go with and help accessorize and style both casual and more elegant looks - and it will work great with a wide range of skin tones. The only issue for me is that the frame is just a bit outsized for my face - an issue that can sometimes arise when purchasing glasses online in general. That said - I think this is a really great pair of sunglasses that will look great on a lot of people.",
