Amazon size said a medium. The coat came and it was to small. I called Amazon and asked for a large to be sent to replace the coat that was a medium and too small. Amazon sent me a replacement and that was a medium also. I have a broken back and can not drive to return these coats. I got a message saying not to worry about returning these items from the first representative I spoke with and the 2nd guy I spoke with it was completely opposite He acted like I was lying I called Amazon back and had a horrible experience trying get the right size of coat sent too me! The gentleman I spoke with was still trying to get me to return the coat and did not want to give me my money back to be able to order the proper size! I finally ordered a large and absolutely love this coat! As a valid customer I sure hope noone else has to deal with this! I do not appreciate the way I was treated!,
