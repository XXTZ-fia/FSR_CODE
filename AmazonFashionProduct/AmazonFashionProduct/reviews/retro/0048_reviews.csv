Definitely need a petticoat under if you want the fullness. I did return it ultimately just because it runs too small.,

Jesy Spence,Long Arms,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HEOZ6R6KLCEB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKDQ8CK,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Note,,I love the dress but it was not made for long girls in mind. The sleeves are too short to be a long sleeve and too long for 3/4 so it looks like a 5/6th sleeve. I just tug it up but still something to be aware of.,

6of2,See through skirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTIJJ73SVXJ8O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKDQ8CK,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 22, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Note,Verified Purchase,"Roomier fit than I was expecting in top. While the top in heavier and stretchy, the skirt is completely transparent and tissue thin so will need a multilayer pettiskirt. Bought for my 13 year old, 5 foot even girl and she loves it, especially with a poofy underskirt. It's past knee length even with an added underskirt so it fits the dress code for the event we purchased it for. Good for the price though. Not itchy or poorly sewn. Definitely going to delicate wash because the top and bottom are not even close to similar weight or material. Not something she can wear anywhere but to a special event.",2

South Jackson Civic Center,Impressive!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R225X10XUR4GAI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKDQ8CK,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 21, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Note,Verified Purchase,"This dress was very impressive on stage in a ""Piano"" number! Received lots of compliments on it! Dresses are 'stretchy' so was able to fit dancers into smaller sizes than listed.",
Kat,"A little thin, but good for a costume.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R236TF8MMZPN6B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRKDQ8CK,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 18, 2023",Size: 3X-LargeColor: Note,Verified Purchase,"I got this for a Halloween costume and honestly the only complaint I had was it was a little thin.  However, it was under $30 so that comes with the territory.  I am 5'2"" tall and weigh 175 and the size chart was dead on for what size was needed.  I normally wear a size 16 and this had me get a 3xl.  I did think it would have a longer torso, but again it is under $30 so I am not complaining.  All in all great for what you pay.",9
