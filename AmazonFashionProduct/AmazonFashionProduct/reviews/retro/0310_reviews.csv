I ordered a large, figuring that a larger bottom would be perfectly fine - and it was. The bottoms are also very flattering, as I’ve had multiple lower abdominal surgeries that left my lower left half much larger than my right. I also have very wide hips, and the bottoms do not dig in at all! My only complaint with the bottoms is the buttons are extremely loose, and feel like they’re barely hanging on, right out of the package. The top, however, runs incredibly small. I wear a 36D, and my chest was BULGING out of the tiny cups (they’re definitely demi cups, and smaller than pictured) and the band was tighter than I’d like, but still manageable, as this is a bathing suit meant for home use. The band clasp seems a little flimsy, as well, and the halter tie is extremely long.  I will be keeping it, as the bottoms would be too big, but it would probably be wiser to just order separate tops and bottoms to get the correct sizing!",
