Hutch,"Attractive design, build quality suspect",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NU4NOMAA297P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJQXXFVR,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Color: Black Frame Grey LensLens Color: Grey,,"At first glance the Retro Oval sunglasses have a nice look and feel.  They are not too lightweight, and I truly like the adjustable nose pieces.  Out in the sun they do a nice job of diffusing the light and eliminating glare, and they rest pretty comfortably for long-term wear.  Since they are listed as glasses for men or women, I do think they should make a better choice of material for the glasses 'case.'  The glitzy, glimmery bag isn't something that most men would want to carry around, myself included.  More importantly, I was disappointed in the alignment of the arms with the glasses at the hinge point.  On both sides there is a visible, uneven gap where the arms attached to the lense frame.  This gap was there right out of the box, so I am concerned with how it looks (slight bend from the side) and whether this is just the beginning of problems at this crucial hinge connection.  Time will tell, but for now I give this just 3 stars.",

Shanna,Exactly as described,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M73BIDOT4XJ3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJQXXFVR,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 13, 2024",Color: Black Frame Grey LensLens Color: Grey,,"These sunglasses arrived quickly and are exactly as pictured. I find the lenses to be a bit darker than my usual choices, but they will serve well on bright days. I like that they came with a soft sleeve case and cleaning wipe- a considerate extra that not many sellers include these days. I have a large head, and these fit well without putting pressure on my temples! My daughter has a much narrower face, and they also fit her well, so kudos to the designer that made a nice universal fit! I really liked that the hinges feel sturdy and do not have the ability to overextend. They're well made and much nicer than most sunglasses I have purchased in a similar price range.",
