Chris,*Almost* Everything I want in a purse!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKHOAOM9EPRXQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07VQK1KGX,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 2, 2023",Color: Red,Verified Purchase,"First I’ll start with the Cons I noticed:  1.  the little short handle on top is just a bit too tight to fit comfortably over the clasp.  I know it’s personal preference, but I like my purses to hang from my elbow when I carry them.  I can and do get my arm in there and carry my purse around my elbow, but it’s a bit more snug than I would like to have, and it would be easier to pick up my purse and wear it if I didn’t have to maneuver my arm in a tiny space over the metal clasp.2.  I don’t need a crossbody strap, so I would like to see an option to not include it in my purchase, because now it’s just taking up space in my closet and I feel like it’s wasteful to throw it away.Pros:1.  The clasp!  I would rather change the strap than not have the clasp.  It snaps easily and it stays securely closed while I am wearing the purse on my arm.  Usually it’s one or the other; either the clasp is too loose to stay shut, or too tight to open easily when I need to, but this purse does it just right!2.  Durability.  I’ve had this purse for 6 weeks or so, and it’s my daily wear purse, so it goes everywhere with me.  I have not seen any sign of wear, relaxing seams or stitches, scuffs, snags, scratches, or separation from the metal frame (which can happen if it’s not sewn in properly).  I know that 6 weeks is not a long time, but I am really impressed with how well the purse has been holding up to the day to day abuse that I subject it to.3.  Space!  I admit, I would like to have a wider base (footprint) for my purses, but that’s just my preference, and I have never found a purse that fits my wants to 100%, so I’m fine with the narrower footprint for this purse.  Despite being narrow, this thing holds a lot of stuff!  I commute an hour to work every morning, so I bring my toothbrush and makeup with me to finish getting ready during my commute, and it all goes in my purse.  My exhusband has joked about the purse being like Mary Poppins’ bottomless bag, and he’s right!  I even had a handheld camcorder in there for my son’s graduation ceremony, because it fit and I wouldn’t have to carry a camera bag to the ceremony.Trust me when I say that I love this bag, and the only thing that makes it a 4-star purse instead of a 5-star purse is the stupid strap on top that makes it so difficult to carry it on my arm, which I prefer.",7
