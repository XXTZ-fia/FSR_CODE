It’s hard buying fun shaped glasses online cause you never know how exactly they will fit on your face or how heavy they are etc. but these were everything I hoped. Perfect size, lightweight, didn’t have the nose things, they are dark so they actually block the sun some and a bonus you can’t see your eyes thru them really. Highly recommend",

It comes with a storage bag with a drawstring closure and 1 cleansing cloth.,

My wife gave these a try for multiple wearings with the understanding that these are priced at $20. We both appreciated the solid hinges. The plastic, although lightweight, feels too flimsy for her. Plastic is used everywhere, but the trick is to manufacture it with a solid feel. The lenses are on the darker side, great for direct sun and driving. These sunglasses lack an adjustable nose bridge, the trendy style lately, so fit is critical. My wife found them to do well, so props here. Time will tell if they can hold up to the riggers of an active sunglass wear's routine here in San Diego. I'll call it a win if she gets a year out of these.",

I'm also known as being very particular (most people use the term 'picky').  So, I was kind of skeptical of these, though they looked really cute and like the usual style I wear.  I also didn't have high hopes about quality, since the price was so low, but I am in need of new sunglasses and didn't feel like going out and trying on a bunch of them at the busy holiday season when everyone is out shopping.  I was more than pleasantly surprised!  They are made very well, and seem much more expensive than they were!  They fit nicely and look great.  I will not need to send them back! I highly recommend.",

The pair shipped well with minimal packaging. These arrived with a soft drawstring bag and a lens cleaning cloth.  I'm petite and have a narrow face and I feel the sizing is just right without being too thin/skinny. I haven't found these to slip or fall off when tilting my head and moving about naturally.  The comfort is excellent. They don't squeeze the side of my head and cause soreness or painful headaches. They have the nose bridge style I like the most style that won't get caught in my hair if you like to pull them atop your head.  I like that these function well during the brightest of days. The lenses are slightly smokey which is pretty cool looking. They keep the glare down and aren't what I would consider too dark or color-changing at all. My sensitive eyes are comforted from the brightness freeing me from squinting and dealing with watery eyes from that.  The joints are strong and haven't become loose with wear. No scratches have yet to pick up on the lenses and they respond well to the included cleaning cloth when cleaned up.  I feel the style is chic and cat eye looks excellent. You can wear these easily with casual to more dressy apparel with ease. Recommended!,

She's worn these a few times, and they are pretty good sunglasses, in addition to being fun.  The glasses are made with light material. They definitely don't feel like expensive glasses, but that's OK in this case. The frames are sturdy enough for occasional use. The lenses are set firmly in place.  My wife is quite particular about the fit of her glasses. But these actually feel comfortable over the nose and ears, with no pinching or discomfort even after a couple of hours of wear time.  The lenses do a fine job of light-blocking. They have more of a darkening effect, as opposed to lenses that color or even brighten your view.  Included is a small cleaning cloth. They do not include a case, which would be a nice touch, but I understand it at this price point.  This is a fun pair of glasses, with decent quality for the price point. I recommend them.",
