From the moment I put them on, I could tell that these sunglasses were of premium quality. The feel of the frames is exceptionally sturdy and well-made, giving me confidence that they will last for a long time. The lenses provide excellent protection from the sun while maintaining clarity and sharpness.  What truly sets these sunglasses apart is the very unique frame design. The stylish rectangular shape is modern and chic, making a bold statement every time I wear them. I’ve received numerous compliments and inquiries about where I got them, which speaks volumes about their standout appeal.  The fit is also fantastic. They sit comfortably on my nose and ears without slipping or causing any discomfort, even after wearing them for extended periods. This is especially important to me as I spend a lot of time outdoors and need sunglasses that can keep up with my active lifestyle.  Another aspect I appreciate is the attention to detail in the design. The hinges are robust, and the finishing on the frames is flawless. Every detail has been carefully considered, adding to the overall premium feel of these sunglasses.  Whether I’m out for a casual stroll, driving, or enjoying a day at the beach, these sunglasses are my go-to accessory. They not only protect my eyes but also enhance my outfit with their unique and stylish design. The balance of form and function in these sunglasses is simply perfect.  In conclusion, the Roneyee Rectangle Sunglasses have exceeded my expectations in every way. Their premium quality, unique frame design, and comfortable fit make them an essential part of my daily wardrobe. I highly recommend these sunglasses to anyone looking for a blend of style, durability, and top-notch performance. They truly are a fantastic investment!",

I like the high quality acetate they are made of and the adjustable setting hinges that will contour to any face width and shape. They have a cool retro feel and remind me of glasses worn in Italian Cinema in the 1960's. Overall a slick set of shades!",
vine reviewer #3990,not good fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGAZW06BZ4EBU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4QHT2D1,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 10, 2024",Color: Black,,"unfortunately they slide down my nose. I have average/normal nose and don't usually have issues with glasses. also, they are quite tight on my head/above the ears. again i have average head shape/size for a man. sadly these are just not great.",

They're pretty wide, so if you have a wide face like mine, they'll fit well without squeezing your temples. Overall, comfy fit. Nice weight to the frames (something I personally like) The packaging was PHENOMENAL. 5/5",

Mister Charlie,Super-cool androgynous shades done right,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VW9GZOG5RTL3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4QHT2D1,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 2, 2024",Color: Clear,,"You don't have to spend three figures to get a hip pair of shades. Roneyee has given us a few different options in the chunky rectangle design they're good at. I went this time with the semi-clear frames, which also feature a copper-colored ornately-decorated strip inset along the temples which is hard to beat.  Although these are UV400 sun protection, you can absolutely see the wearer's eyes on this set of frames at least... the shade is very light, with a slight bluish hue to it.  When buying glasses/sunglasses online, I always recommend measuring your favorite pair's width (these measured about 15 cm or 5-7/8"" across approximately -- 148mm according to Roneyee, so pretty accurate). These are chunky and big so they won't look awesome on all face types, and they do have a little bit of heft to them, although the acetate is lightweight.  The carrying case is a cool design and the outer box is as well. It's an art piece on its own! Win win win!",

They are well-built and sturdy; just what I need for doing farm work in the hot, bright sun. They fit well and are comfortable to wear. They're like looking through a tinted windshield. These sunglasses also keep the dust and other particles from attacking my eyes. They come with a sturdy case and a cleaning cloth. Most importantly, they stay in place and don't slip down my ski slope of a nose. Two thumbs up!",
