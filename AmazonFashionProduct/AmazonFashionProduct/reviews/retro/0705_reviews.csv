The second dress I received did not have the disproportionate height in the shoulders. The pattern does not line up between all the pieces exactly, but nobody cared or noticed except me, lol. It would be nice though, if the company took a little bit more care to line up the pattern as they did in the example photo.  So, that is the only reason that I would give this one less star. However, for the price and style you get what you pay for. Oh, and, I did not put in an a dryer so I couldn’t tell you if it shrinks any. I wouldn’t do that anyways because then it fades the fabric faster. I did not have to iron it though.  I wore it to a day wedding with a an evening reception.

I do not like how the top is fitted. Too much room in the armpit/bust area, and it leaves this weird gap of extra fabric. The dress has some stretch, but I feel sizing down to address the top of the dress would have made it too tight. Photos are with the dress right out of the bag. Now I am stuck trying to decide if it is worth keeping and trying to get out the wrinkles and fit it better. The idea is really adorable, and I was really hoping for better.",10
