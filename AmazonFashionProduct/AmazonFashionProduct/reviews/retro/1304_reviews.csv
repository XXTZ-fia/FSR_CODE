Ernie Jemente,Great quality material/had to get a smaller size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1L6D7AX03D7GZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4F62SGZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 16, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Butterfly,,"5' 2 1/2"" 111.5lbs BUTTERYFLY just as beautiful as I imagined. The colors of the butterflies are bold and true to color as the picture. The fabric is the best quality I've ever had on my body. That said... A butterfly belt is black at works with my try on. It would add to the beauty of the dress if the belt buckle had a butterfly on the black belt. Though it being black works wonders for the look. I followed the size chart and got a medium. I am new to women's sizes so I got the medium. It came almost to my ankles add the top is definitely for um, bigger chested women🤷‍♀️ I did reorder in a small size, not knowing it this would shrink a little when I washed it with the % of cotton. I'm giving it a 5 because it is beautiful great material and true to the 50's look. If the small doesn't work out, I'll go back to the teen sizes, but probably won't find anything this beautiful. ❤️🦋🦋🦋",

Kindle Customer,Waist is very high and pockets are uncomforable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D2R1X84JPIGD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4F62SGZ,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 18, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Butterfly,Verified Purchase,The item fit well and could have been flattering...but the waistline may have been made for a shorter person.  I am 5 foot 10 and the waist fell right under my bust. This would place the belt that I did not remove from the wrapper right under my breasts and possibly it would have been hidden. It was hard to get my hands in the pockets because they are at the dresses waistline(so fully bending my arms to try to angle them in).  It could have been a win had the maker dropped the waist to a natural position.  True to size and looked like durable material.,2

I am 5’ 10” and 240 with a large chest.  I had no trouble having it zipped.  The material is firm and held the ironing and starch even through packing and a plane ride.  I paired it with a sheer shrug so I could hide some arm fat but could have gotten away with it alone.  One great feature is that you don’t have to worry about your tummy since it flares out really high.  You could hide a pregnancy in this if ya wanted!  I highly recommend it!,9

It’s highly conspicuous and not in a place where I can readily cover it with anything. So I’ve l been reluctant to wear this out, so even though it fits well, it’s seems as though it was a waste of money because I’m not confident in wearing this dress anywhere due to the mid placement of the pattern. I also bought this (similar) dress in a check pattern (the one with straps and decorative covered buttons down the front) and it looks beautiful on, also with the same good fit, with no pattern issues.

Fits amazing and is super cute.  The belt it comes with feels cheap, is super long, and gets in my way as I have to wear it pretty tight so I’ll not be using it. I will replace it with one of my own or maybe a cute fabric ribbon.  The butterfly platter is very cute. The fabric is more cream than white which is fine for me but it’s shear so either wear light colored under garments or a slip. If you want this to look like the pictures you will need a petticoat to add a little lift to the skirts otherwise it is just like a sundress.  My zipper gets a little stuck on the fabric but that only happened with the small size(didn’t happen with the medium) so I think the zipper may just be defective. Stitching is good and there are no loose threads on either of the dresses. The dress does arrive folded in a bag so it is wrinkled. After hanging it up for a few days the wrinkles didn’t fall out so will probably need light ironing to smooth it and maintain the pleats.",4
