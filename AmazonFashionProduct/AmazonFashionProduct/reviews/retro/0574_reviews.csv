The material is great- nice and thick and it's even a little stretchy. The dress is VERY form fitting, though. I ordered my normal size of medium the first time. It fit, but I didn't like the way it looked on ME. Sent it back and ordered a Large. Just tried that on and that also fit and fit well, but I still feel like I need to go one more size up. If that doesn't work, I'll just assume the dress isn't made for me and pick something else. It's really pretty and comfortable, though. If I can figure out how, I'll come back and do an update after I get the 3rd one.",

Clothes lover,Belt too long….. but dress is fabulous!!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FXSDX4OQS5Q0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09ZY5MVF8,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 27, 2024",Color: RedSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"This dress will fit well and look beautiful on anybody!  Shapewear will make you look even better ! I bought the red nautical dress.  Nice fabric with stretch and a smooth zipper quality.  And my only complaint (and it seems all other companies have the same problem) is why is the belt so long? There are a lot of holes to notch the belt, but the holes are in the wrong place. I had to punch in an extra hole since the other holes were too loose around my waist which left a lot of belt I had to tuck in halfway around me! Maybe I will take the belt to an alternation shop to cut off 1/3 of the length. I am not even that skinny with a 27 inch waist!",2

However, it arrived without the belt. So it’s disappointing that the look is incomplete. They don’t give the option to replace, only refund. I don't want to return it but I shouldn’t have to go buy an additional belt to complete the dress.",4

I read this in previous comments and thought it was a mistake. I ordered two and neither has the belt. I NEED THE BELT. If the belt was the selling point for you DO NOT order this dress. I ordered two in different sizes and neither came with the belt. Amazon did nothing to make this right and neither did the seller.,3
