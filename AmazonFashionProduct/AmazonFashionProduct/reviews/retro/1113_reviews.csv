The construction and little details are great. I love how the sleeves are constructed, and how fitted it feels.  I got a medium, and it fit me well for the most part. The pleats on the chest look a bit odd though, a little too much material. I'd size down, but the shirt fits snug at the waist with the elastic. I think it might work better for a bigger chested gal. I'm going to add a couple of stitches to the pleats and see if I can make it fit a bit better in the chest. If it's a simple as a few stitches to fix, I'll upgrade my rating to five stars.  The material is nice. I got the shirt in black, and it wasn't translucent at all.  Overall I'm very pleased with the quality of the shirt. Just be aware that like any fitted shirt, it won't be a perfect fit for every body type.",

I always like vintage styled clothes, and i like the fact that i can get the look without wearing old, musty clothes even more! This is the perfect mix of retro styling with modern fabrics and comfort. And this top is definitely comfortable. It's a soft polyester with enough stretch to be comfy and fits pretty well. The blouse is on the fitted side, so if you're between sizes or want a looser fit, DEFINITELY size up. There's these elastic ruched panel things on the sides that help give the top it's silhouette as well as expand or contract to fit perfectly. All of the stitching is spot on, the shirt looks phenomenal with jeans, leggings, slacks, (skirts for sure!) etc and also layers well with either a vest, bolero, pea coat, blazer, etc. It's really a 'find-your-own-style' blouse.

The style of this blouse is terrible, IF you are planning on leaving it untucked. If you plan on tucking it into a high-waisted bottom, you should be good.  The elastic ruching allows for you to go a size down on this, since there is a lot of stretch, but those panels look weird so it's better if you tuck it in so that you can hide those. Tucked in, the style reminds me of a blouse that I bought from The Seamstress of Bloomsbury for a lot more money.

I ordered a large. 38” bust, (36C bra size) 30 inch waste. As a petite person (5’2”) this blouse was way too big all around. The bust darts fell to far below my chest creating far more fabric around the chest area. This garment was designed for women who wear Large Regular. Sizing down probably would have improved the fit for me but I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to button it up. There appears to be at least 3 inches of ease in the chest area. However the waist area of the garment fit well…. The sleeves were too large and flared out like wings. Overall, this is a really nice retro design but it didn’t work well for my petite body frame.  Taller women would look very lovely in it but not me. Also, it’s all polyester AND very stretchy. Wish it was made in a nicer fabric (silk would be so lovely) I guess You get what you pay for.

Were I to wear this blouse untucked, like I do with most of my shirts, I probably wouldn't like the look, but with the skirt I got it for, it will look best tucked in and therefore it's a moot point.

I paired it with a pink chiffon a-like skirt and it stayed tucked in all day. The fabric is airy and a bit see through so you'll need an undershirt.

Caroline,Alright but elastic looks odd,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R104Y52B9IN6Z3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQP75JFD,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 2, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"This is an okay shirt. Overall, I like the fit and it seems true to size except it seems SHORT and the elastic accents do not appeal to me. I'll wear this black shirt, but under something because I do not like the way that the big elastic things on the sides look.",
Bronto154,Nice lightweight top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPPSYO0JX3BPS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQP75JFD,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 1, 2024",,,"This is a nice all purpose top that is as cute as it is comfortable. It arrived with no snags or wayward threads. The seams are straight and evenly spaced. The top is true to size. The pretty light blue is saturated throughout the garment, so no pale places. It fits well and is an easy wear. Overall this is a good little top that will surely be a go-to.",

This is a size Medium. Measurement lying flat unstretched are: Bust 18 inches, length 23 1/2 inches, sleeve width 7 3/4 inches, sleeve length 6 inches, waist 16 inches. The measurement listed on the ad are true to size. The material is super soft and feels very silky on the skin. It buttons up the front and has a nice elastic waist that gives your figure a flattering look. This blouse would look great with a matching jacket in the wintertime. I am totally satisfied with this beautifully designed blouse.",2
Be,This is a cute white button up with a bit of a twist.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1F7GP3D9LLCR4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQP75JFD,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 25, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Ivory,,This is a cute white button up with a bit of a twist. The cut is very feminine tampering at the waist and with slightly puffed sleeves. The taper is achieved by ruching on the sides of the shirt so it is stretchy and flexible. Like most lightweight white shirts it is a bit transparent and you’ll likely want to wear a cami or an undershirt with. The buttons are pretty large but still easy to button.  Size medium fits a 170lb 5’7” woman well. Machine washed and  air dried with no issue.,

The fabric is so soft and not irritating to the skin. I love how the fabric cinches at the waist and how the cut of the blouse leaves extra room for the breasts. That's always my main gripe with button up blouses for women. So, if you have curvy measurements, you'll be happy to know this shirt will fit your body type perfectly! Im a US size 16 in Women's and the XXL fit perfect.",

Rene M Garcia,Another great blouse!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22A9RIUJNM8XD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQP75JFD,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 22, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Ivory,,"I LOVE this brand! I am 5’7”, about 170 lbs, with measurements of 38-30-42. I usually wear a large. The large fits perfectly. No gapping at the buttons and nicely nipped in at the waist. The fabric is smooth against the skin. I have not laundered it yet. I was too excited to try it when it came in. I was a little leery of the elastic in the back but it helps to keep the top closer to the body when tucking in and gives more wearability for ladies of different size hips. I love the gathered shoulder detail, the great collar and the rolled sleeves. I find their tops to fit true to size.",7
Holly J Stewart,Thin material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35OPHOMWF6QQ4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQP75JFD,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 19, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Ivory,,The material is thin and  not completely opaque. The fabric is soft and stretches but does require ironing or steaming. Fortunately the top is generously cut which means the buttons don’t gap. The cut is attractive and comfortable.,2
Esther Schindler,A great everyday shirt. Not WOW but I expect to wear it often.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VG6GN8KBQDE2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQP75JFD,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 14, 2024",,,"This isn't the sort of blouse I'll put on when I want to impress someone. It's a basic short-sleeve button-down shirt to pull out of your closet on a random Wednesday -- which is actually its appeal. I don't always want to startle or surprise anyone, including myself. I look nice, I feel comfortable, and it goes with just about anything.  The fabric is the happy medium between ""not too heavy"" and ""not too light,"" and it feels good on my skin. The neckline is good to show off a necklace, but not at all revealing. It's long enough to tuck into jeans, but not excessively so. The darts make this feel fitted without binding, and the (slightly odd) elastic smocking gives the style a nice shape.  The fit is true-to-size. There's no worries with the laundry, despite ""hand wash only;"" I wash everything in cold water, and I threw the shirt in the dryer. It doesn't show wrinkles at all, which is convincing me that this shirt will be a good choice for travel... particularly since the color and style suits my usual wardrobe.  Nobody will stop me on the street to say, ""How lovely!"" but I won't be embarrassed either.  Decent price, too. This is easy to recommend.",6
