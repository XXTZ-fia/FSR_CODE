Just another Customer,Little small for my face,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3T862BDZ7JTZ4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGJ53SN6,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 13, 2024",Color: Grey Frame Grey LensLens Width: 54 Millimeters,Verified Purchase,"Tad bit small for my face, but they’re still decent. If you have a big head, or at least a head with some width, you MIGHT want to reconsider. I wear them occasionally, and I like them, but they’d 100% be much better about 5mm wider. I find myself wearing my older shades more still. The lack of width puts pressure on the nerves above my ears.  Smoky clear design, decent quality over all. If you’re looking for a blackout lens, this isn’t it though. It almost seems as if you’re not even wearing sunglasses. ALMOST. There is some dimming/light blocking, but it’s very much a bright lens. I’m sure the UV protection is there, but if you have light sensitivity like me, it’s not blacked out enough. Too much hassle to return them, so I’ll keep wearing them very occasionally, or give them to my son.",
