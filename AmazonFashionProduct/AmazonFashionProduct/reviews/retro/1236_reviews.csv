Sadie Alonso,Gaining my confidence back.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35ZAJQWSDS98P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C9QLNJSN,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 26, 2025",Size: 3X-LargeColor: Porcelain,Verified Purchase,"I haven’t worn a dress since I was roughly 10years old. I am now 24 and at my heaviest weight due to an autoimmune disease. I stand at 5’4 between 320-325lbs with a size 42D chest & a B/Apron Belly.  I purchased this dress to be able to attend a JW meeting for my father in law. While not religious myself, I wanted to still be able to support my husband by supporting his parents. I wanted to be modest and this dress is just that.  It is stunning and modest. I will be placing a small white jacket over it and pairing with skin tone tights and ballerina flats.  What you see, is exactly what you’re getting.",

Fancy Foxie,Flattering!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PZODDXEP1J7N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C9QLNJSN,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 9, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Black Peony,Verified Purchase,"I painstakingly sifted through many dresses here and ready many reviews before deciding to purchase this. I sized up as recommended by many other reviews before and the dress fit perfectly! It’s flattering and fun and versatile! It’s also comfortable! What sold me was someone stating if you have a “mom bod” then this is your dress… and as someone with a mom bod, I can completely agree! I wore it to a wedding and ate a lot of food… and I neither felt restricted by the dress nor did I look like I ate everything I actually did eat (LOL). The material is thicker and the dress feels like it’s made well without spending a fortune on it. Worth the money!",
Kadee,Perfect! But there’s been a change in material!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BBRQCWVFFY0I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C9QLNJSN,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: B-green Plaid,Verified Purchase,"I got this to wear on Christmas.  I ordered it on December 22n’d, it arrived on time.  I got xtra large.  I am 5’4” and 170lbs, but most of my weight is on my bum/thighs and arms.  I have a narrow waist and small chest. The dress hit exactly at my knee.  I haven’t washed it yet and I don’t know, but don’t anticipate it any shrinking. It fit with some additional room in the waist/chest area but was comfortable and fit perfect for a holiday, lots of room for all the food I ate and super comfortable for all the sitting I did, but I could have gotten a large. **NOTE** However, I have to say that it wasn’t what I was expecting, as I buy this dress in different patterns often.  It has been one year since I bought one however and these are the noted changes… The material is very different and initially, out the bag I was VERY upset… but there’s a happy ending!  So, I have tried to highlight the differences in the attached pictures. For the comparison the older dress from 2021 is Red/Navy, while the Green/Navy dress is the newest from 12/24 (the most recent dress prior to this one is from Winter 2023 and is the same as the red/navy).  For starters the new one has a liner…YES, a glorious liner!!  I have some small sensory issues, but with this dress…  I could sleep in this dress! Don’t get me wrong, the red one is comfortable, but it is nothing compared to the new green/navy lined dress!  While the old dress is obviously mostly cotton, evident by everything in the world wanting to stick to it.  It does a far better job in catching all the lint than the dryer lint basket!!  I now wash and dry that dress alone!  Yet it gets worse, the red/navy, notorious for the stubborn wrinkles!  The come out with ironing and you get a couple hours of sophistication..  But this new dress (hearts for pupils) The new dress ARRIVED in an amazon special delivery bag(sarcasm)  it arrived in a BALL, but  that  darn thing slipped out and was ready to wear. Now that I think about it, I am pretty sure an iron would melt it, lol!  But lets not get bogged down with silly details.  What is important is that despite my initial hate and skepticism for the change in material…. after wearing it on Christmas I then decided to wear it on my drive home, 14 hours!!!  And that trip was never more comfortable!  Lastly, it comes with a sash, of which I didn’t wear around my waist, instead i used it for a headband, when they come with the sash I usually go the headband route, but you should know it was BIG, the sash was ready for anyone’s waist, for real.. Also note there are no sash loops on the dress, which I prefer.  Finally, I returned to order more and figured I would leave a review.  They’re true to size IMO, comfortable and versatile.  I often wear these dresses with a pull over sweater/boat neck.. and you can’t see the top so it appears that I am wearing a skirt and top.  Or you can wear a cardigan, or you can wear a white button down dress shirt (fitted), but of course it really needs nothing. Overall it is a very pretty and flattering cut and I love the new material.  Not sure what is up with the tags, but I don’t care either.  Ordering more.",5

Con - the darting around the bust did not take into consideration to line up the plaid pattern and it ended up looking very odd. The green color was maybe a bit more muted than I would have liked.

I think it will work for any event as it can be dressed up or made more casual.  The reason for only 4 stars is the fact that this vendor charged my card days before shipping the product, it was delivered 2 days late which isn't really a big deal but charging before shipping is, I think, somewhat a big deal.

I actually went up a size because of bigger bust, so was surprised it was tight and was expecting to reorder in a smaller size. I think this one is going to be a person to person issue.
