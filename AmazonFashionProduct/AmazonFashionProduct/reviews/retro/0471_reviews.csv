This return label does NOT include postage. In order to return a $30 dress, you would have to pay over $100 in postage. When I contacted Amazon customer support I was informed that the the refund had already been issued (even though it wasn't in my account) and if I didn't return the dress, I would be charged again for the dress (EVEN THOUGH I NEVER RECEIVED A REFUND).

However, if you are a very particular shape you might be able to wear it better. I don't believe that will be the case for most people who buy this. Also, the chest area wasn't flattering.
