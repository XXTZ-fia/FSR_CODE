Returned that and tried again but second glasses I received a Matte Black Green lenses but the brand said Merrys? The glasses look so similar and it looked good. I decided to buy again (3rd time) and see if I would get the actual Gtand brand and when I received that, realized that the Merrys one looked better ahh. I felt the Gtand frame looked quite small being that its width says 145mm? (I have other glasses 145mm so I am aware of the fit) Ended up just keeping the Merry brand and returning the Gtand one.",

I wasn’t giving up until I found the perfect one and I really like the C13’s! I needed lightly tinted glasses when I go to any store because fluorescent lights give me headaches. I also wanted to see wth I was looking at and I feel like wearing normal sunglasses indoors looks “suspicious”.  As you can see in mine and many other reviewers pictures you can practically see my eyes behind the lenses making it perfect for all my needs! I have a pretty narrow/slim face and I wish it fit my face a lil better but the glasses itself look and feel great. And it’s light and comfortable! Doesn’t put any hard pressure on the sides of my head. Highly recommend the C13’s!,13

The lenses are very good with maybe the slightest haziness to them but overall no complaints at this price point. The hinges work well, tight but not too tight and these glasses sit straight on my face, not lopsided. I would however prefer they had a slight inward bend (toward my face) at the nose piece. These frames are straight as a board across the bridge, rather than contoured inward.  Packaging on these is impressive, Apple like almost, with a neat little pull tab and drawer style box. You get a felt lined semi/hard case with carabiner clip, a glasses bag and cleaning cloth.  These things exude style, are built well, are packaged well and come with a multitude of accessories and you get all that at an exceptional value. I will certainly keep this brand in my sights and highly recommend these...Well done!",

The width of these sunglasses is 145mm, and these fit my larger sized head well. The temple length is 145mm, and will work for small, medium, and large head sizes.  The construction of these frames is a glossy black plastic, and feels about average in quality. But these glasses have all metal and pro styled hardware that really gives these sunglasses a more high end look, and performance. The tinted lenses (I choose green) are very clear to look through, and have no noticeable distorting one might expect from lower priced sunglasses.  A big added bonus with this purchase is the designer box, glass sheaths, and glass case that comes along with these sunglasses. The case quality I would expect from a high end sunglass manufacturer, but you get that great quality here!!!!  Well done, and great shades, and great value!!!!",

Not only do they look like something a movie star would be seen wearing, they’re of such a high quality. First, the frames. They’re thick, sturdy, and definitely not too loose. As you can see, I have a wider shaped head and they fit snug enough to where they won’t fall off too easily. I can see with proper care, these sunglasses should last several years.  The lenses are equally stunning, strikingly tinted on the inside. They block the sun, but I can still see things outside without any obstruction.  They arrive in a standard glasses case and its own cleaning cloth—something I have a million of because I collect sunglasses. What I find useful, is the carabiner keychain attached to the case which makes them quite portable. What a genius idea!! All this to say, these shades are extremely gift worthy.
