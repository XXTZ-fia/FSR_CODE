I do not want to bring my more expensive prescriptions with me due to the possibility of me misplacing them.  I came across this 3 pack, that the seller has several option to choose from.  All 3 fit the same and have the same smoothness and flawless look to them.  My favorite of the 3 is the brown, which has a very nice tint to the glass where it goes from very dark on the top and fades to a light tint towards the bottom.  I have a larger than average head and these fit perfect on my ears/nose and don't hardly move around.  The darkest pair, I will wear around the pool or those sunny days, the other 2 I think I can get away with wearing indoors without looking to obnoxious.  In any event I like this set and would suggest these to those who like to be stylish while keeping the sun rays away.",
