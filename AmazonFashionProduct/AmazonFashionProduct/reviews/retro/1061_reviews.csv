By the end of the day, my eyes feel much less strained than usual.  The style is cute, and they look great on. The frames aren’t the highest quality, but they’re comfortable enough to wear all day. For the price, they’re definitely worth it.  If you’re looking for affordable glasses that actually help with eye strain, these are a nice option.",
