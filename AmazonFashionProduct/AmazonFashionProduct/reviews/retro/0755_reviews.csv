However, they are complete garbage when it comes to durability and wear. The material is thin and the integrity of the denim is poor. They always rip in the back pocket and crotch after minimal wear. It is the true definition of insanity, continuing to buy the same crappy jeans hoping for a different result. Do better Wrangler, or drop your price point to reflect the inferior product you are selling.",

I still wear them due to not being able to return them. I just wear them with my belt cinched a little tighter than I’d like to.  Other than the super skewed sizing and cheap feel of the “denim”, these are comfortable jeans and look good with any of my boots. Would by again, just two sizes smaller.",2

Love the feel, fit, look...awesome.Second - The Greely color jeans are completely different than the Layton color ones I purchased.  I swear they're a totally different jean.  Layton doesn't have the feel, fit or look of the Greely, and it's not just the color.  The Layton's stretch out after one wear and the Greely can go 4-5 uses before I wash.  The material feels different and way more durable than the Greely.  I have no idea what is going on, again, I swear it's a different jean material altogether.  More info: The Greely fit like a slim fit with a bit of stretchy which I absolutely find amazing and can wear multiple times with the same fit and feel. The Layton, stretch after one wear and I don't like to wear them multiple times as they become to baggy for me.  The Layton have become my plane jeans - wear on the plane and toss them aside.Third - The Greely color are my favorite but they will tear in the seams and pockets.  I machine wash on cold and air dry (PITA).  I've used patches to hold them together as long as possible (PITA), but my first pair failed within the year.  I told myself maybe they're defective and purchased another pair in November 2023, already failing on one the pockets, I will patch. again.  For $52, for me I will just buy another pair and hope for another 6-9 months of use.  Not ideal, but I love the jean that much...been trying to find a replacement but everything leads me back to these....darn you Wrangler.I want to try another color but my wife thinks I have issues and will threaten a divorce if I keep buying jeans....it's out of control and it's a problem.I will post some photos when I can soon.",
