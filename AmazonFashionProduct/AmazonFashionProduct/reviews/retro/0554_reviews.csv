Misty B,Great Dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V7B4F6YT7EYG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRPDWX3Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black Cherry,Verified Purchase,"This dress is SO cute! I wore it to a semi formal event with Mary Jane’s and received so many compliments. It’s very forgiving with the elastic under the bust and the length is perfect. I’m 5’9”, 255ish, 42DD, size 18/20 and the XXL was perfect (even maybe a little loose). I probably could’ve gotten the XL, but I liked that nothing was too tight. It has pockets, but I would only trust them with a lippie or some gum, but not my phone.  I did travel with this dress and even though I steamed it before packing, I still had to steam upon arrival. No biggie, just FYI. I would definitely order again and am looking at other prints now.",4

The material is nice and strong, this dress should last a while. It has a built in slip underneath which is nice so you don’t have to worry about being compromised. It also has nice ruching around the waist which gives an hourglass figure. I highly recommend !",9

Knowing the pale green could wash her out, and shes not a fan of cherries, I went with the yellow. It fits great, just shorter on her due to her height, btu that makes it perfect for summer use. She loves the underslip, and is willing to put up with florals due to its swingability, Its a cute fun dress for vacation, or a summer event.",

The quality is amazing! It falls beautifully. It is wrinkle-resistant. The liner doesn't catch on anything, and is very comfortable!  I've gotten a lot of dresses online that were not anywhere near this level of craftsmanship, but were in the same price range. This really stands out from the pack.  The stitching is beautiful and even. The placement of the stretch panel on the back is ideal. It allows the dress to perfectly fit a range of shapes without having the whole thing made of stretch fabric.  It is absolutely gorgeous! I'll be wearing it on Easter and all year. The colors match what is shown online.  I have a large bust, a short, high waist, and long hips. This looks tailored. But the give on the back panel would provide that fit on lots of body types.  The skirt flows beautifully! I want to wear it all the time, and it is my new favorite dress! The coverage is perfect. It doesn't gap at the armpits. It fully covers my bra. The material is sturdy enough and lined, so panty lines don't show. It hits just below the knee, so it is comfortable to wear at a wide variety of events.  It is the first dress I've felt amazing in since my 2 year old was born. It is incredibly flattering and forgiving. But it also doesn't look like something designed to hide under. I 100% would have been excited to wear it at my lower weights as well, and that's a big part of what makes it feel so incredible! I look and feel beautiful in it.",

It fits nicely around the waist and bust. It’s probably good for medium to small bust sized people, like me.  I think large bust sizes may struggle since the fabric doesn’t have very much stretch. The pattern and design are exactly as pictured. Wrinkles fade somewhat when hung to dry. But the deep wrinkles needed a touch of steam to release. The length is good. I wear a small at 5 foot tall and it reaches mid calf. It’s just a really nice light fabric dress for warm weather.",

For me, the dress is not very flattering and it’s a little tight in the bust area. the dress comes to about the knee so it’s perfect to wear with sandals or flats. The back half of the dress is flattering. It does have a little tie at the neck area so your back is out slightly. if you have larger breast, maybe size up a little bit as I felt squished in this dress other than that if it’s true to size.",

That being said, I am in the petite side, so this dress hung at a long awkward length on me. I am used to having things hemmed to be fair though. The fabric did feel flimsy and a little uncomfortable to me. I felt that when for being long, the skirt just hung a bit limp. The elastic on the sleeves seemed to slide around and itch in the time I was trying this on. The back tied easily and the side zipper was a nice touch to help get this on and off. I do like the inner fabric layer to add a little thickness to the dress, and the design is nice. I can see where the vintage design can be indicated, but in my opinion, when I had this on it didn't resemble many of the iconic vintage dresses you often see. Still, it's a nice dress and I'll probably wear it around for a day to further test this once the weather warms up!",2

It's currently priced at $42 and for that price, it's a 5 star dress- the dress is lined (which is rare these days), there are pockets, the cut is flattering, and the sewing quality is good with straight lines and no crooked pieces. I have the dress in yellow which is bright and perfect for spring and summer.  Now that said, the fabric is a little stiffer than I would like and I tend to veer towards natural fabrics these days but this is not a dress that would cost $42 if it was actually cotton. I wish it was just a smidge lower cut but I would say this is a pretty modest cut dress and the hemline hits me just below the knee (I am 5'8).  All in all, this is a good quality dress for the price. I have quite a few things from Belle Poque and they've held up for a long time so I know when I'm buying from them, I'm getting good stuff.",5

First and foremost, the fit of this dress is impeccable. My daughter, who typically wears a size 8/10, found this dress to fit her perfectly. It hugs the right places while still allowing for movement, creating a flattering, elegant, and comfortable silhouette.  The material of the dress was a pleasant surprise. Contrary to our expectations, the fabric is incredibly soft and comfortable against the skin. It feels high quality and durable, promising many wears without losing its charm or comfort. The comfort factor is crucial for my daughter, who is a yoga instructor and values feeling good as much as looking good in her clothing.  Moreover, the dress features pockets - a detail that both my daughter and I are thrilled about. Pockets add not only practicality but also a casual ease to the overall design, making the dress even more versatile and functional for everyday wear or special occasions.  The square neck and puff sleeves add a touch of vintage elegance, enhancing the cottagecore aesthetic that is both trendy and timeless. The dress's design manages to be both eye-catching and understated, making it suitable for a variety of events, from casual gatherings to more formal affairs.",13

The colors are vibrant and it's a well made piece. Second, the fit is pretty dead on, as far as I can tell it's very true to size.  I do have one complaint and that's the fact that the stress seems to be made for somebody who's at least 5'10"" because of you're any shorter than that it just seems like it's too long. I'm petite as it is so I'm used to things being long on me, but it's still pretty long even on my friend who is 5'8"". If you try to wear a petticoat with it to make it bounce out, it doesn't really work because you'd expect the dress to hit at about knee-length for that and this is far longer. It's not a deal breaker by any means, I just wish the dress was shorter and I think at this point I may take it to a tailor and have them shorten it professionally because it really is a beautiful dress.",

It’s a polyester fabric that has a silky feel and should wash up nicely without ironing. It has the typical side zipper you would find in a 50’s dress and has pockets. The plus I’d it is fully lined so no reason to wear a slip. I usually wear an xl - 1X. Knowing most imports run small I ordered a size up. It was still too small in the bust. Makes me want to cry since I love this dress and does not come in a larger size.,3
