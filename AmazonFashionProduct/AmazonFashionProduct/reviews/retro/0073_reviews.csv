It is not an overly heavy sweater which is great for Southern California. I am not too sure how this is going to hold up, the fabric is not the best and I can see where it may fall apart in the future which is a huge bummer because it really is so cute. I love the contrast of the black against the colorful crochet sleeves. I took one star off because the quality just is not there but I still really love it and plan to wear it as many times as I can before it falls apart.",

The sleeves are beautiful and add just the right amount of boho style to this sweater. I've dressed it up with a skirt or down with shorts and Van's- it's a versatile item. It fits me perfectly with enough room and the length isnt too cropped. This would make a great gift!",

She said that the sweater itself ran a bit large, but knows that it's supposed to be oversized anyway!  She loved the detail on the sleeves and said that the yarn was soft and will wash well.  The only ""complaint"" was that she couldn't quite figure out what to do with the collar. She said she feels it should either be longer (to make it easier to roll) or shorter (to fit more like a mock turtleneck). Fortunately, she is good with a needle and thread and said it will be easy to modify a bit!  She recommends!",6

I find this acrylic ribbed sweater unique and rather appealing in black. I ordered large as I normally do. I now believe I could have easily downsized to medium, as well. I could not make sense of the size chart online for I did not understand which diagram applied to this particular sweater. The shoulders are puffy and loose. I find it soft and comfortable.  The drawbacks to me are a number of imperfections, like extra orange string hanging out from over the right shoulder which seems irrelevant to the design or manufacturing. I think this is very casual, as if for a stay-at-home day by the fire or cooking and doing dishes. Keep in mind that one’s skin or shirt underneath will show through the big holes in the sleeves surrounding the flowers. This may or may not be a drawback to some.  Although this sweater could keep me warmer on a fall day, I also find it rather thin. I notice that my lightweight t-shirt underneath, belts, buckles, necklaces all show through the sweater shape for a bit of lumpier look than normal. I was disappointed in this. However, overall, I love the uniqueness, color, and comfort.",14
