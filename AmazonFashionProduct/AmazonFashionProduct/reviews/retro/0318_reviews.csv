Leonor,ROBOTIC AND HEAVY,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHLTC06L135IS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DN11XQ3L,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"You will sound like a robot to the caller, and you cannot hear the ringer when the phone rings. That was MY main purpose was for buying this product to hear the ringer. I work at a very loud factory and cannot hear when my phone rings You can hear everything else BUT the ringer when your phone rings. It is also VERY heavy for being so small. It pulls on clothing no matter where I clamp it too. IF you are buying this product to hear music then I would give it 5 stars because when I did play my music it was awesome but that is not why I purchased this product so a 1 star for the purpose of my purchase.",
K Patrick Bowen,Surprisingly Good!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSL4YKHHNJS15/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DN11XQ3L,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",,,"To be perfectly honest, I didn't expect much from this speaker.  It's been my experience that a speaker this size and at this price will sound tinny and begin to break up with increased volume.  That is not the case with this little speaker.  The sound is full with great bass and doesn't break up at all.  This is an all around great speaker.  It's small enough to take anywhere and even has a clip so you can hang out on a belt, backpack, or whatever.",

Nichole S.,Compact and Impressive,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R219IXQU1O2Q8D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DN11XQ3L,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",,,"This little Bluetooth speaker is so cute and practical. I used it while cooking, baking, or cleaning, and I love that I can easily attach it to my apron or shirt. The clip has a strong hold, so I never worry about it falling off while I move around.  The sound quality is fantastic. Even at its highest volume, there’s no tinny or cracking noise, which I’ve had issues with on other speakers. It’s also impressively loud, easily cutting through background noise like a vacuum.  The battery life is excellent. It lasts for hours without needing a recharge, which is perfect for long days of use. I also really liked the packaging. The protective shell not only kept it safe during shipping but is also great for storing the speaker when I’m not using it.  Overall, this is a well-made, high-quality speaker that I’d happily recommend. It’s perfect for anyone looking for portability, durability, and great sound.",
