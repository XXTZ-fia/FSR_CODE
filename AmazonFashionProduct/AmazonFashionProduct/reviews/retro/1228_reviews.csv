The lace up back is a good idea but not enough.  I am 5'6, 165 lbs, 42-31-42, 34G, and usually fit well into retro/pinup or body con and especially halter tops. This is not a halter, the waist is far too loose to provide any underboob support or replace a bra strap.  The back when laced all the way shut comes close but really there's not much waist bust differential. Even if you have the kind of boobs that can usually go brakes in a halter dress or shirt or use a triangle bikini top easily (I can all the above) this weirdly compresses them and does nothing for them?
