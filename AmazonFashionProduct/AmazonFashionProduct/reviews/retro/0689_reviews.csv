After losing my previous pair during a vacation, I needed another pair. I didn't want to get anything expensive because I had just lost my old pair. All of that brought me to these sunglasses. If you only have five dollars and you had to spend it on sunglasses, these wouldn't be an awful choice. However, they broke in under two weeks. They also had a cheap 'feel', which I'll elaborate on later. Don't buy these, they're not worth the meager price Amazon's charging for them. Let's begin with the fact that they broke so quickly. I could tell they didn't have quite as much durability as other sunglasses by the weight and flexibility, so I was especially careful with them. Even so, about ten days later, I tried to unfold them and one of the temples broke off. After that, obviously, I was unable to wear them. Even before that, there were scratches on the frames when I got them, as if they had sustained damage while in the box. If you want sunglasses that will last longer than a month or have a durability greater than that of a potato chip, I highly recommend against buying these. Even when they weren't broken, they still 'felt' cheap. What I mean by this is that you could guess they weren't expensive just by looking at them, and you would be sure if you touched them. The entire thing was flimsy exce[t for the lenses, and the lenses didn't do much to protect my eyes from the sun. In addition, the sunglasses were incredibly light. I generally want products to be lighter and easier to carry, but I felt like these sunglasses were going to fly off my head at any moment. Even if you want to buy cheap sunglasses, I'm sure you can find a pair that doesn't make you look poor. Some might say that these sunglasses are really good for the price, that you're sacrificing a little quality but overall they're worth the money. I disagree, they're not worth the meager amount they cost. If these sunglasses break early like they did for me, you've spent your money on what is now essentially nothing. So their value is now zero, which is obviously lower than Amazon's asking price of five dollars. If you want your money's worth, just pay a few more bucks and get yourself a pair of lasting, quality sunglasses. If you're still dead set on buying these sunglasses after everything I've said, I'm not going to stop you. However, I think you should think about this decision before you make it. These sunglasses broke in ten days for me, who knows how long they'll last for you? They're so obviously cheap, people that see you wearing them will think you're poorer than you actually are. So please, don't contribute to the problem of this product making money. Please, don't buy these sunglasses.",
