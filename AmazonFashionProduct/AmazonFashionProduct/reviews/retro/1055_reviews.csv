Alena Cooper,Gorgeous!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Q8S4YWV7HWTU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D45JMZQ8,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 30, 2025",Size: X-SmallColor: Brown,Verified Purchase,"I truly expected to get this and most likely return it, I purchased as part of my Ren Faire costume and I was afraid it might seem a little over the top, be too big, or the sleeves just be huge and overwhelming. But I put this on and fell in love! My husband loved it too and thought it was super cool and unique! I’m very petite with absolutely no chest (I’d be a 30AA if it existed) and while I will wear a tank or sports bra cami under it I really could just wear a bra (or no bra if I was that kind of girl) because I can wrap around and tie in the back to make it look more modest. And because the sleeves kind of open at the elbow it really lets the material flow nicely and not get in the way. The branch/leaf pattern is stunning and looks so high quality and the brown/orange is the most perfect rustic fall color ever! Highly recommend and I’m definitely buying the other colors!",

Francesca,amazing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WO90TCE656EG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D45JMZQ8,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 22, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Brown,Verified Purchase,im actually in love with this shirt its so beautiful and made with a good fabric as well,
Ivy,Went above my expectations,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C45VO6U43P5F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D45JMZQ8,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 25, 2024",Size: X-SmallColor: Orange,Verified Purchase,"For the fabric, it was surprisingly warm. The sleeves are like big blankets. I was totally expecting them to be uncomfortable too, but the length was easy to manage throughout the day. It does tend to gap around the chest, especially when bending or hunching  your shoulder, but that could be fixed by buying a smaller size or using fashion tape/glue. Overall, worth the purchase.",
Luusaki,Loved and fit great!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REZY2QL7L277X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D45JMZQ8,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 11, 2024",Size: X-SmallColor: Orange,Verified Purchase,"I got pretty nervous about the fit, but it fit great as an X-small, 5'4"", 112lbs.  The blouse looked exactly like the picture, and the fabric, though probably a cheap fabric, was smooth and soft. The bell sleeves are huge and so fun exactly what I wanted.",
