I prefer polyester because it doesn't fade like cotton. A hundred washes later and it'll look the same as it was on day one. It also dries more efficiently. Since cotton absorbs more water, it stands to reason that it requires more drying, therefore more heat for longer. The downside to polyester is that is also retains odor more efficiently than cotton. Something to do with oil from the skin staying on the surface and oxidizing vs. being absorbed with the moisture within the cotton fibers. If I remember correctly. Otherwise, nice shirt.",

White thread was used for the majority of the seams on this black shirt. The white stitches show from the front side.

There is also a black rectangle about 1”x3/4” that is a different color of black in a random spot on the back of the shirt.  We ordered a XXL and it does fit true to size.  The price at the time I chose it was $14.88 and at the time of this review has gone down to just under $10.  I cannot recommend this shirt.",

The picture is crystal clear and you can tell what it is from a long distance away. The thickness is decent it's not quite as lightweight as I thought it would be for being a moisture wicking type of shirt but it is what it is. It's comfortable to wear however it is not long enough. If there were another two to three inches longer it would be absolutely perfect. Other than the length the fits fine. Good quality materials and that's a good value regardless of the fact I just wish it was a little bit longer.,
kindler1973,Sizing is off,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2A8DE5W1OFU8E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D29TDYN4,"3.0 "," the United States "," April 25, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Butt,,"This shirt is funny and definitely a conversation starter! From a distance it looks like mermaid scales and up close there is a variety of butt shapes and sizes! The fabric is lightweight and feels like it's moisture wicking as well. It's soft, launders easily, does not need a lot of ironing and doesn't wrinkle easily. However, the sizing is off. I measured my fiance before getting this for him and I know his chest size to the inch - when this item came I measured the shoulder width against a M sized t-shirt he was wearing and it was a match. The item I ordered was a large because I sized up for allowance. But when I measured the body of the item, it looked like an XL-L size! The width of a Large is too large; the body of the shirt is like a tent. I should have bought him a S or a M but based on the size chart, the M chest at 49inches would be too snug and notes show to allow half inch for tolerance so we sized up. Additionally, the item is described as Dry Fit - but a DriFit Polo shirt is typically smaller in size across the body so usually you size up for more room. Stick to your size or size down if you are getting this item.",
Chris M.,"Nice design, but poor quality",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8I6VVYI2BACR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D29TDYN4,"3.0 "," the United States "," April 21, 2024",,,"Overall I'm not terribly impressed with this shirt.  I like the design, and it looks OK from a distance, but that's about all of the positive things that I have to say about it.  The material is thin, and very cheap looking.  It's like the entire shirt is a ""print""... the inside of the black shirt is white, giving it a very cheap look and feel.  The stitching isn't great, and the one I received has several areas where the stitching appears to be loose and pulling apart... I expect after a couple of wears and washes, that it'll begin to fall apart.  I'd probably give less stars, but it's pretty cheap and you get what you pay for... so I think a middle-of-the-road rating is appropriate.  If you're looking for a cheap shirt for a one-time event, then this might be a decent option... but if you're looking for something of decent quality, I'd pass on this one.I wouldn't buy it again.",

It fits well size wise but the proportions make it a little uncomfortable. The tiny collar is difficult to keep in place and flaps around as you move with the shirt.

This material is thin and can be breathable but in my experience it can also trap some body heat more or feel a little warm on the skin when you're out in the sun on a hot and humid day.That's all fine I think it's par for the course and my Hawaiian shirts are like that too.  What makes it look a little weird to me is I feel like this pattern/design may look better on a full button down Hawaiian shirt and not a polo.  My wife's direct words to me when noticing it were that looks weird but makes the shirt look that much better.  So if you're going for a funky goofy vibe then maybe this is fine.  But I also feel like the cut/sizing is a bit more baggy/boxy than most other large shirts and may have played better if it was a full button down.  If I had gotten a medium I think it would have helped some but likely been a bit short in the torso for when I am active such as swinging clubs or if I were to ride my bike while wearing this.  At $26 you get a fun and mostly functional shirt.  If you're between sizes like me or have a bit more of a lean torso then it may look to fit a bit odd though I might be overly critical on this one.",

Funky fun style. I’m usually a xxl but this was too small need a XXXL. Would probably fit better at that point. So I would order 1 size up. I am 6 ft 3 and 290lbs for reference,

This shirt is horrible quality and the sizing is beyond wrong. I ordered a 2XL for my husband who normally wears an XL after reading the reviews. The reviews don't to the bad sizing justice. The 2XL i ordered should be called a medium at best.,
