I like them I have another pair which look the same but it's not quite the same those are gradient these are straight dark Gothic which is nice and mysterious and that's me, mysterious. lol Good price too decent quality all is good won't break the bank and can be very useful specifically polarized shades they really block that glare so yeag these are recommended again you just can't go wrong a little retro yet modern. Btw if they slip on ya look into how to adjust plastic frames/ shades it's not too hard with some heat like from a hair dryer and go slow but they can be adjusted. Great ,I'm a very happy camper Thanks for letting me review this product I appreciate it. Cheers.",3

The lens color is a handsome green, the frame feels decent (time will tell how fast the arms give out) and it's got a cleaning cloth and carrying sleeve.  Tons of extra packaging/plastic on this, though. Tons of extra layers of plastic sleeves from the manufacturer, the box it ships in should be more than enough to protect the glasses. I do wish they'd figure out how to send this to consumers with a bit less waste involved.",
