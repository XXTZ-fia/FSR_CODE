Rather than spending $100-200 on blue light blocking glasses, I bought these. They're probably not quite as good but they're better than what I was using before. They have deep red lenses that block out a lot of blue light. Better than the pinkish ones I've seen elsewhere. May not be the best glasses to wear indoors because the red is quite deep and dark.",
