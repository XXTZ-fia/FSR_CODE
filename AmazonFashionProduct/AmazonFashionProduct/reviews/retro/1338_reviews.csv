It looks nice and it fits well but I will say that the fabric is a lot more sheer in person. It’s not see through but it has a slight sheerness to it I hadn’t expected from the photos.

Just wish it was a little better made but you get what you pay for and it’s a fine shirt.,

Bunny,"Very cute and vintage looking, but I don’t love the material",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RO4PMQMFHFYG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQN78N5M,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 14, 2024",Size: SmallColor: White,,"The details on this blouse are so cute—the collar, the overlapping sleeves, and the way the darts are sewn. It washes nicely and the wrinkles are smoothened out with the wash. I don’t love the fabric that it’s made of. It’s 95% polyester and 5% elastane, so it’s soft, but the material doesn’t feel the best. I got the color white and it’s slightly sheer.",
Stacey and Ian,Belle Poque is always good!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37VBJPP4BDXXH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQN78N5M,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 14, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Black,,"Looks fantastic, fits like a dream. I adore the way the sleeves overlap, giving it a lovely retro look. This is a perfect shirt for work, classy and stylish. It's super well-made as well, very fitted and flattering.",
Mary M.,Elegant Fitted Petal Sleeve Blouse,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TLENIDL8Z96D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQN78N5M,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 13, 2024",Size: LargeColor: White,,"I love everything about this blouse.  How it's fitted for a lady's curvy shape, the soft and comfy fabric (95% polyester, 5% elastane), the tulip sleeves, etc.  As shown in the pics, it will need some ironing before I wear it out, but that's no big deal.  It does need to be hand washed--which isn't convenient--but it's worth it to have a classy, flattering, white blouse that you can wear for business or leisure. The buttons are very easy to work and securely sewn on.  Fits true to size--I'd ordered large and it fits perfectly.  I'd love to have a pink one as well, so I might order another in that color.  Definitely worth the listing price.",5
Misty Frogg,I absolutely love this blouse,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAME7VKUOEU1V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQN78N5M,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 10, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: White,,"For years, I’ve looked around for fitted blouses for plus size girls, and often times. They just aren’t cut properly and are very unflattering.  This shirt is not like that the cap sleeves have a little overlay like flower petals which is really beautiful and I love the way the seams are done which also creates a nice illusion  The line is underneath both breasts, which allows the blouse to have a more fitted look  The material has some flexibility so that it is forgiving and it is plus size inclusive Me being a size 16/18. It hung on me perfectly.  I also like the button placement it didn’t feel like there was a button above and below my breast there’s actually a button holding the shirt closed in between.  Price point is perfect fit is perfect and the white is true white all the way around a five star blouse  Definitely a great ad for your closet",2
Rene M Garcia,So cute And fits well!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R250LUZ8NCP25F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQN78N5M,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 9, 2024",Size: LargeColor: White,,"I am 5’7”, about 170 lbs, with measurements of 38-30-42. I usually wear a large. The large fit nicely. If your are bustier you may want to go up a size. The shirt feels nice on the skin and seems well made. I would wash on delicate and hang to dry.",4
Cassondra Hill,Beautiful shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LN324WH5X4DH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQN78N5M,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 6, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Light Pink,,"This is a really beautiful and well made shirt. It's a little on the heavier side material wise, but it is still pretty light. Might be too heavy for summer, but would be perfect for fall or spring. It has a flattering cut, but is still work appropriate",
