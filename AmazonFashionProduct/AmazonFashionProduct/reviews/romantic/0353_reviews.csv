Lillian von Reyn,LOVE this dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Z84YXBOERSTV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX8WJF3D,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 30, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Light Pink,Verified Purchase,"I bought this dress for an early fall wedding and it was absolutely perfect! I didn’t want to break the bank, and this one was perfectly in my price range. I was worried that the material would be thin or cheap feeling, but it seemed to be sort of lined so there was no issue with that at all. It was also quite stretchy so it had some give to it, and had some ruching to it which made it even more flattering. The stretchiness to it made it incredibly comfortable to wear throughout the night even after dinner and while dancing. I also got so many compliments on it and felt so good about myself in it!",
Celeste,My opinion,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AMLU23XZIT7P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX8WJF3D,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 9, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Light Pink,Verified Purchase,Wore it for my baby shower and I loved it just 2 things about it that could have made it a 5 star rate. 1- it was see through but I wore undergarments so it helped. 2- the straps kept falling like if it fit big but didn’t because from everywhere else it was good.,

Meg,Beautiful dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E71X7SY888GQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX8WJF3D,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 18, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Light Pink,Verified Purchase,"She looks amazing, I mean she looked great with just the dress but the  accessories added to her dainty, sweet, girly, girl spirit for prom day.  The dress has some elastic give to it but it clings nicely and has a slight flare on the bottom.  The dress is thin but grey for spring or summer weather or indoor function of cold.  The dress is gorgeous.",4

Amazon Customer,So pretty just not for me :(,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VXORZBF1BPP1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX8WJF3D,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 27, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Light Pink,Verified Purchase,This pink dress is absolutely gorgeous but this is not for the pale girlies :( I have very fair Irish skin and when I tried it on the color just completely washed me out. The dress itself is so beautiful though and very flattering just not for me. Also size up because I’m usually a Small but the Medium fit better.,2

Arielle,Beautiful dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSIPQOZQVBTVG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX8WJF3D,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 28, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Light Pink,Verified Purchase,"I am 5”2, 146lbs and ordered a medium and the dress fit perfectly. Length of the dress stops to the middle of my shins, design and style matched the images accurately, and stretchy material makes a comfortable wear when sitting down. Questionable video of product—dress in the video doesn’t match the images at all which is why I put 4 stars out of 5 but overall greatly satisfied with product.",2
Kristine,"Cute, but not suited for my body type",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R5TFFY90KVBD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX8WJF3D,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 21, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Light Pink,Verified Purchase,"I'm 5'9"", 195 lbs, and busty (36D/XL). Right now I typically wear a size 14/size large in dresses. I ordered a size large. Dress is overall very stretchy; the slip lining is stretchy and the outer printed material is a stretchy netting material. No problems getting it on despite no zippers or buttons. This dress is definitely as pictured and really cute, but also cut for someone with standard or smaller breasts. The ruched bust only partially covered my boobs. Only other aspect I didn't care for was the striped shadow effect that the netted layer created underneath onto the lining. Will be returning and not reordering, but I still recommend it for a cute, romantic vibe.",6
