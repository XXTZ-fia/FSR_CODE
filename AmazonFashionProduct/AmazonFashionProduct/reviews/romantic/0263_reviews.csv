It’s a nice peachy nude at best. But essentially looks like someone washed a beige dress with a red garment. It’s an off pink not beige. I specifically needed a BEIGE dress for an event so this won’t work unfortunately. Super comfy and cute though.  Despite the nice fit and look, it’s only two stars because the color is not what was advertised.  Ignore the hanger size in the photos, it’s just what i had. The dress is a small.",8

Also in the photos on Amazon the bow in the back looks like extra but you have to tie to bow to hold the dress up on your body. That’s the part that was actually too big for me I’m 32 weeks pregnant so I thought maybe I should get a medium instead of my normal size small and I’m glad I got the small bc a medium just wouldn’t have worked.,3

It's a nice lightweight dotted cotton and it would be wonderful for a hot summer day. Not too sheer, semi-lined between waist and knee. Sleeves are voluminous with the right amount of elastic.  The cons: the ""sash"" is attached to the bust which is a useless place to be attached - it should be under the bust. The smocked top was actually looser than I'd anticipated and didn't provide support -- which is unfortunate because even when you wear the sleeves up, you can't wear a bra with the dress.  If the sash was in the correct place, I probably would have kept the dress and tried made it work for casual summer wear. But re-sewing it seemed like too much for the quality and the slightly unflattering bust.",4

The ties are very much too short to tie a bow or anything except a knot and I wish they had just cut them off.  Very much not worth the money since it's just a very simple dress with elastic top section, but that's Amazon for you. It looked decent on me.",7
