RT,Worse than you think,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R282QJCUDX5YXA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9Z9YXDZ,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 5, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Multicolored,Verified Purchase,"Stumbled upon RTR and purchased pre owned clothes to start, which was a huge fail. Clothes were so very worn (especially this very tired sweater, I donate clothes well before they reach this level of use). Overall with RTR pre owned experience was non hygienic as I found a long hair on an item and one sweater smelled horrible. I returned every single item very grossed out. After reading further I realized the RTR collective are brand new clothes. Make the switch!",3
