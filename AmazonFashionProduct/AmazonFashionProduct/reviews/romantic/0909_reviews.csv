sheryln,Perfect date night activity!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDGVD84I9051E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DPCR5FZJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 26, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"My partner and I loved this paint kit! It was such a fun and creative way to spend time together. The instructions were easy to follow, and the quality of the materials exceeded our expectations. We’re not professional artists, but the kit made it simple to create something we’re both proud of (and now we have matching art for our walls!). This was the perfect mix of relaxing and engaging, and we’ll definitely be ordering another kit for our next date night. Highly recommend!",
Anna Douglas,So much fun!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QL73Z35SM7EK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DPCR5FZJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"Love, love, love this! What a great activity!  It arrived quickly, was beautifully packaged, and came with everything needed. I ended up using this for a 'date night' with my 82-year-old mom and we really had a wonderful time! It was a great bonding experience. Will definitely order another!",
G. Pritchard,Great for dates- and quelling sibling rivalry,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUIPS1GRZOQ6W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DPCR5FZJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"I bought this for an inexpensive at-home date night but ended up using it during a snow day so my two high schoolers wouldn’t be on their screens all day. At first they poopood the idea, preferring to Snap their friends- but then they got into it and actually had a lot of fun. The painting is simple enough it made them feel like decent artists, but challenging enough to occupy them for almost two hours. And they even had fun coming up with silly answers to the conversation cards. Date night kit for the teenage win!",
jeffery james,Great product and awesome idea,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QQ0HDGDHZI6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DPCR5FZJ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",,Verified Purchase,A wonderful idea to be creative and paint as well as talk to and learn more about your date.  It's also pretty cool how the images can stand alone or be mated together to make a larger picture.,
