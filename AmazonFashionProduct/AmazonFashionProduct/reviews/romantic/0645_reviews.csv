All the buttons on the top to the waist are functional and the last 5 buttons are also. This gives you the chance to have a deeper neckline, ability to breastfeed/pump for mama's, and to make the slit in the dress more pronounced.  I did find that the sleeves are a little snug if you have beefy arms. I usually go up one size in most dresses for length and more of a loose fit. I'm glad I got the bigger size. I fear my true to size would have been too snug in the sleeves. In my one up size, the sleeves are fitted but not so snug that I can't wrap my arms into a hug. Please Note: the sleeves DO NOT stretch. The only part where this dress has stretch is in the waist line to accentuate curves in a flattering fit.  I will recommend this pretty dress to others and simply advise potential buyers to be mindful of their arm sizes. My arms measure about 15in loosely. Again, I have beefy upper arms. I went with the 2x instead of 1x or XL.",

Some people say what's the point of the white taggles around the waist, but it didn't bother me. Do air dry this and steam iron it to dewrinkle. Do not machine dry this dress. There are no pockets. The button holes are elastic band, and only the upper body and below your thigh ones are real. The pelvic area buttons are not oprable, and it was a bit hard to manage the operable ones. I was at a wedding as a musician because, previously, the bride asked if I could wear a floral dress and this was my choice and when it was breezy, my skirt became very flowing and I loved it. I have broad shoulders, with 36b, and I am about 5'4"", and just a tad less than 130 lbs and I ordered small, and it worked for me. Maybe the chest area was ever so tight, just barely,  and I think i could have ordered M because of this, but maybe, the elastic band button holes were helpful for that.  I hope I get more use out of this dress.",

If I get that cream color is the fabric so thin, I can see through it? The answer again was no the fabric is a good enough quality you do not see through it.  With the button or the button holes were made good enough that it will stay buttoned? Yes it is stayed button. I haven’t had any problems with the buttons at all.  I wonder It will wrinkle up really bad? No not really I even took it on vacation and it did well.",

Every time I wear this dress I get compliments! It’s super comfortable too. I initially ordered one in black and another in pink, but just ordered 4 more in other colors.  Sizing seems true to size. I’m about 5’7 180lbs and a large is plenty big enough. I almost ordered xtra large bc of the reviews, but so far, large fits well. They do wrinkle easily.
