Color is very much like portrayed. Imy size runs all over the place between XL -1X depending on manufacturer (5'1"", 165lbs). I chose a 2X based on measurement guide. Perfect fit. Creates a beautiful silhouette of an hourglass figure. Fun swirl of the skirt. Downside: the neckline of.the dress isn't sewn down. As a result, the fabric slips out from the crease wrecking the neckline. For me, it's an easy fix with ""stich witchery"" but I shouldn't have to do that"". The other con (for me personally) is that the neckline on the back of the dress and shoulders are wide enough that I will need to purchase a different bra so my straps don't show. Overall, I'm happy with it. Its a classicstyle that can be made retro or current simply by pairing with the desired accessories. 😁",

I have nothing to fill out the bust of the dress so it just looks like extra loose fabric where boobs are supposed to be. Would fit a lot better if you had at least something, ya know? A small should fit like a small in all the spaces, chest included. Or at least include extra small sizes??? Maybe just maybe? I see so much inclusion for plus sizes but not for petites. And not only with this specific dress, all over the clothing industry. The sizes go from small to XXXL but they can’t even have ONE extra small option?  Why include one side of the spectrum but not the other? Since when does a small fit like a medium? If I needed a medium I would’ve ordered that.

Ive seen better but Ive also seen far worse quality from amazon sellers. It seems to have a really good shape and fit. If it was the color shown and ordered I'd  have given 5 stars. The issue is that the color of the light blue is more of what I'd consider the color of hospital scrubs that have been washed and faded over time. Its nowhere near as cheery and bright as the stock photo. Seller was polite and prompt to return my messages. I eventually bought one that was the color needed and gave this to a neighbor.,4
