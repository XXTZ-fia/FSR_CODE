FYI the strap adjustment is in the front so i will be removing those and just stitching straps in place permanently. the plastic adjustment pieces make it look cheap and like it was a last minute thought. those should have been put in the back or left off. at minimum they should have been same color as dress. it will be great on the cruise we are taking. cheap enough that even if never worn again it wont matter.",

The material feels like some kinda generic satin thing, not incredibly fancy but it doesn't feel weak in any place in particular. I have to pick it up just a tiny bit when going up stairs but I like that aesthetic so it doesn't really bother me in case others are worrying about it being long.
