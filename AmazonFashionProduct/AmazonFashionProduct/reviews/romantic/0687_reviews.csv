I tried styling it with a dress, and it hit a little too high on my torso, throwing off the proportions.  The quality and fabric were nice, and I could see it working well with other outfits or high-waisted pieces, but it just didn’t work for me with the dress I wanted to pair it with. Ultimately, I ended up returning it because the fit wasn’t right for my style.",

The short sleeve and crop design of the cardigan provides a bit more modesty to spaghetti strap or halter necklines, allowing you to make your outfit more versatility.  Gives just a little warmth for cool summer mornings and they you can take it off when the day warms up. Fit was true to size. Fabric is soft and appears well made with no loose threads.
