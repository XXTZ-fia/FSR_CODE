Carmela,Gorgeous Top,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMV44VMEJ75M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9ZDKR5N,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Brown,Verified Purchase,This too does everything you need it to do and more. I took a gamble and sized down since it was preloved and assumed it would be “stretched” which it definitely was. But it worked out because it fits me perfectly! The knit on this too works to really cinch you in. Any girl would look gorgeous in this.,

On the other hand for price, if you’re short with a straight frame you can probably achieve “meh.”",
