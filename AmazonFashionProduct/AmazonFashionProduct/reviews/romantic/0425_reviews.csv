I purchased it in a size medium and it fits perfectly and is true to size. It is really beautiful and I think I'm going to get a lot of use out of it. This is a perfect dress for beach restaurants, weddings and church. The people who said it was a wrinkled mess were not lying! I was getting ready to purchase a steam iron when I had an idea to just spritz the dress down with cold distilled water from a sprayer I use to mist my plants. It worked like a charm! Even the ruffles towards the bottom which were all pointing up are now laying flat as you can see. I just kept running my hand over the dress for about five minutes front and back after I spritzed it and it took all of the wrinkles out.I'm going to try that little trick on some other items when traveling now instead of taking a steam iron along. I would recommend this dress or any of the other dresses in this line.",

When will manufacturers figure out that the ""waist"" of the dress is supposed to be at the woman's actual waistline, not wedged up high under her boobs?  The proportions might be OK if you're somewhat short, and wear size Small, and have a small chest (although in that case, the dress overall may be too long). If you're larger and 'better endowed', the waist will be 5"" or 6"" too high up. Their idea of adjusting for larger sizes was probably to only make it wider (i.e. one direction only, although women are three-dimensional).  If they had only scaled up their sizes rationally, rather than cutting corners and being lazy about it, I'd buy at least two or three more of these. What a waste!",7
