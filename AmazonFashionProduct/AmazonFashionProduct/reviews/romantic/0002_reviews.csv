Kristina L. Knight,This dress is great!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XSFJKYXFCPFB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CW37DWR2,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 28, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Multicolored,Verified Purchase,"This dress is lined in a very soft, almost t-shirt like material, so its quite comfy. Fit is as desired. Colors are true to the pic. And it was in excellent shape for a garment that was, presumably, worn by a few people in its past. I am very very happy with this purchase, and will definitely try out more R-t-R options.",
Tellurium,Well made dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1K08IUYRPM7E2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CW37DWR2,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 28, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Multicolored,Verified Purchase,"This is such a well made dress! The fabric has good weight to it and it is fully lined from shoulder to hemline (not arms, which is totally fine by me) this is a great winder dress. What you can't tell from the photo is that the fabric has crepe texture which makes this dress unique. I am size small with 34B chest and fits like a dream. My third pre-loved order. Very clean HOWEVER, the gold neck hardware has many scratches that make it obvious this one a second-hand clothing. This was already stated in the product description (minor imperfection) but I'm docking one star for it. Still, at $40, this was a great buy!",
