Amazon Customer,"Cute and comfortable, but a bit sheer.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R259TL05VI24ZW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWTKCF8K,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 20, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Beige,,"I think this dress is a great option for date nights. It's pretty and relatively comfortable so, if it wasn't so low cut in the front, I would wear it more often. I have a larger chest and, while the dress fits fine and I don't feel like I'm falling out of it, it does shows a lot of cleavage. If you have a smaller chest, you could probably get away with wearing this beyond date night. My only issue is that it is a little too sheer because it only has one layer of fabric. I have tan skin and wearing beige underwear clearly shows my panty lines under this. I opted to wear beige shapewear that covers my torso down to my thighs, and that worked fine.",

However, I initially ordered the recommended size (medium -- usually a safe bet), and it wasn't just a little too big, it was literally falling off of my shoulders. If you're iffy about sizing, go down. And if, unlike myself, you have been blessed with significant cleavage, you might be better of skipping it altogether, or be prepared to get some double-sided tape going because it's going to be dangerous without.",

I purchase a lot of free people clothing and the prices are so outrageously expensive and seem to have gone up even more lately! This is a free people replica I think , but I know the one from FP is probably cotton or a better ( not so hot ) material.. so this dress is polyester and quite heavy so I don’t think I will wear on hot days . I will say for a replica it’s pretty damm close so thumbs up for that ! I do recommend this dress but just know it’s a heavy Polly olly material.. would have given a 5 star  if the material was better so 4 star for me . Hope this review helps !",5
