It’s lightweight but not see through at all with the lining. The neckline is very square so you can see my bra straps but I plan to either pin them to the side of the dress or wear a strapless bra. If you have a smaller chest I feel like you could go bra less, but I have a very large chest at 180 lbs so a bra is necessary for me. With the neckline being so square it seems like it’d be very easy to wear the sleeves off the shoulder without them riding up, but I won’t be wearing them that way. I got the pink color and it does look as pictured, but there are tiny little stripes and circles in the fabric that weren’t visible in the photos. They don’t bother me though so I’m not mad about it. Overall I would recommend this dress. It’s a good price for what you get. It would make an adorable church dress or even a maternity dress. I’ll definitely be wearing this until it falls apart on me! For size reference, I bought an XL, I am 5’1 and 180 lbs and have a c section tummy and I feel like this is very flattering for my body type. I did see someone noting the elastic is really tight but I don’t have an issue with it.",

The white is similar - it's VERY white in person, and the flowers stick out. Neither of the dresses are sheer, and they're also lined. The dress is flattering, comfortable, the fabric isn't itchy at all, and I love the slit up the side. The fabric is also quite lightweight in my opinion, so it's a great Summer dress, and you never feel too hot or sweaty in it. The shirring in the chest area also makes it a great dress for anybody who has a big bust like me. I love it so much I plan on buying it in the other colors!",2
