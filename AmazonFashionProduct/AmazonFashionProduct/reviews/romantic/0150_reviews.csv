Anonymous,Be careful if you have different sized chest and butt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BVPWJDK2U1GE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09H2LFN82,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 13, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Mesh Black,Verified Purchase,"I thought this dress looked really cute on the model, but if you have a bust and butt that tend to be different sizes (think of if you're different sizes in bikini tops and bottoms) it won't look like that. I got a small to fit my chest, but then the dress ended up being very short and a bodycon like fit on me as opposed to the flowy skirt shown in the picture. (My measurements are 34B, 28W, 37H) If that's what you're looking for though this dress is ok. Decent quality, not sheer, and he sleeves are cute (but be careful if you have longer arms, they may be an awkward length). The chest does cinch with those cords so you can tie it tighter if needed which is nice. The dress is double lined sort of, with the opaque black overlaid with mesh like the sleeves, which I didn't realize from the picture. I'd also be careful if you have bigger or more muscular arms because the mesh sleeves don't stretch much.",3
