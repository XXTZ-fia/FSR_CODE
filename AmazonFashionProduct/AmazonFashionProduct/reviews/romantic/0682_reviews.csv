I really loved the cut and fit of this dress but it’s impossible to wear the because the zipper is so cheaply made that it doesn’t even function. It’s absolutely NOT worth the price. Cheap zipper, it broke when my husband tried to help me zip into the dress. The zipper couldn’t get through the waist seam and then when forced (mind you, this dress was NOT tight on me.. plenty of room to zip) the zipper just busted apart. Save your money and get something better. I’m so disappointed. I’ve been wanting this dress for years",
