It has grown on me. It is not a dress I would wear to a second dinner engagement but it is a dress I have worn to run errands without looking like a mess. I have received compliments on the dress each time I wear it. Maybe it looks better on than it feels? Surprisingly the buttons are still in tact as well is the color after several washes. Practicality is the theme of this dress for me. I needed this dress to wear to my husbands western dinner theme party. It was OK. The buttons were not sewed on very well and the material had a weird smell. I haven’t worn it again since February and probably will end up donating it. It serves the purpose for the western outfit with cowgirl boots but did not love to keep.,

(I wouldn't wear it when temps were above 60 or 70.) It's very comfortable. It looks and feel like 100% cotton, (although the tag says 15% polyester.)  Length: I am 5'5"" and it hits slightly above my knees in the front and it's a little longer in the back.  Waistline: It isn't particularly flattering on my 5'5"" 135 lb frame. It makes me look a little thick through the middle, but this is typical of a baby doll waistline. In the pictures I posted, it doesn't make me look thick when my arms are raised, but of course I don't always keep my arms raised! Lol. (It might be more flattering if all of the tiers were sewn into the front too. But, maybe not...)  Color: I bought several colors hoping to keep one or two. The Rocknight Blue is super cute. The pictures don't do it justice. I kept that one and the Vintage Black.  Overall, I recommend buying this dress!",4
