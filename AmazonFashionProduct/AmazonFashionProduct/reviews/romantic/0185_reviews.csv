The fabric is very soft against the skin, the lace sleeves are always soft (and not itchy, how some lace products can be). I'm 5'1"", 175 lbs. I'm somewhere between a size 14(still too snug) and size 16 (slightly baggy). I ordered the 2x initially. When I went to order the top in purple this time, I toyed around with going with the XL/1X. But I don't like clothes really tight against my skin and get very self conscious about my 'rolls'. I ordered a 2x again because I can wear it slightly looser or cinch the waist for a more fitted look or even wear it as a dress (it comes down to about mid thigh on me). If I wanted a more form fitting top, I would have ordered the XL/1X. I can't say enough great things about this top. At first I wasn't sure about the cost. But the top I ordered in 2012 fits exactly the same as the one I purchased this year. Stitching is good. It is not a cheap fabric. Well worth the money in my opinion. My boyfriend bought me two more for Christmas!  I have also purchased another style of Dare to Wear blouse (Gothic Victorian Boho Women's Plus Size Electra Corset Top). Fit, fabric, stitching all great. I did order the other in an XL rather than 2X for when I want a more form fitting look. Hope this helps anyone considering buying one of these blouses!",5
