First, the dress is very 1970's.  Like Little House on the Prairie. I got it for church, I wanted something modest and there aren't many nice dress shops anymore.  The fabric is not great, it's very thin, it comes in a suction pack and appears very cheap.  A slip is 100% required.  It's very long.  It does look attractive on, it does make my waist look small, but at the same time, for someone as short as I am, the length of the skirt is a couple of inches longer than I expected so it takes over my whole self.Someone in the comments romantically described this as the perfect dress for New England.  Well, I'm in New England and it's fall, and this dress is way too thin for fall without a wool undershirt, wool leggings, and a coat over it, so I don't know if they are in California and just dreaming or what.  The fabric is a weird oily synthetic.  Who knows.  No fabric is good anymore.I'm 5'3"", 118 lbs and got a medium.  That's the correct size.  Everything on here is in Asian sizes, measure yourself and look at the size chart.  I also got a wide elastic belt with a front clasp because who wants to look at a dress with a plain elasticized waist, and that did help. I think they should have included a matching fabric tie belt, but no luck.",24
