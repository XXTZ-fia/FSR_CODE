This material also wrinkles easily and tends to always shrink. The top is very low. The sleeves are good, but that doesn’t do enough justice to save this dress. The only good is that it is flowy.",2

While my bra was hidden quite nicely in the front and the back, you could see about an inch and a half of it under the sleeve.

MHelmerick,What’s with the Ric Rack,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28N9W0Q9YCLAF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGHV7C7Z,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 22, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Yellow,,"So I didn’t notice in the photos of the dress in the ad that there is ric rack on the dress at the sleeves and for some reason across the front of the dress in an odd pattern.  It wouldn’t be bad if like the picture shows in the ad (you have to look really really hard) it matches the color of the dress but that’s not the case.  My dress is yellow and the ric rack is a beige color.  It matches but it’s just odd the way it has no rhyme or reason for where it is, it’s long on one side and short on the other, see picture.  However, I really like how comfortable this dress is and I love the pockets.  The elastic around the whole neck line is really nice too.  It is sheer, definitely need to wear a slip under it to avoid showing off all your assets, and the girls, lol.  It’s a pretty yellow color but I wish it was all yellow to hide the ric rack.  I don’t know that I’ll wear this out anywhere but it will be nice to wear around the house on hot summer days.  Amazon said I would wear a large but my usual size is a medium.  So I got a medium and it fit just fine, it is very stretchy.  Oh and I should add its floor length, I think if I would have got a large it would have hit the floor, it’s very long.",

It's a very pretty dress and the fabric is soft and feels comfortable on the body.  However, as you could see from my pictures, the dress I received is sewn wrong. There's much more fabric on one side of the bodice than the other, so when the dress is on, it pulls to the one side and the elastic band doesn't sit evenly across the body. There is also a lump of fabric that sits between the cleavage that feels quite uncomfortable. I won't be able to wear this dress out of the house because of the the way it is sewn. I might wear it as a nightgown next summer. So disappointing!",
