I ordered it a few weeks ago and a few days before it was delivered, I found out that she had been having an affair with another man. Now I know this is why she asked me to buy it for her because she never has asked me to buy anything for her online before. He’s why she lost that weight, toned up, bought a new bikini, and wanted this sexy cover to go with it. Not to look hot, for me or herself, but for her new boyfriend who is 21 years older than her! 24 years older than me and I’m 50. True story and I wouldn’t put it in Amazon review, but it’s not their fault or the product. Plus it will probably be the last thing I will ever buy for her. Anyway, when the item finally came, I texted her (she is living with him now) and she came and picked it up so I guess she and her new man really like it. I never got an answer from her when I asked though. Lol",
