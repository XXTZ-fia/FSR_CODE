Southern Doc,Not as soft as the pink version of this dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WF9DBFWKCKOZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9Z9YKSC,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 24, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Grey,Verified Purchase,"I have the hot pink version of this dress and love it, so I was excited to get the navy blue version, too. Surprisingly, the fabric was much stiffer and rougher. It also seems to run a bit smaller than the pink version, but that might just be because the fabric is so much thicker and less flexible. I'm keeping it because it's still cute and I got it on sale, but if you're trying between this version or the pink, this is definitely the lesser version of the design.",
