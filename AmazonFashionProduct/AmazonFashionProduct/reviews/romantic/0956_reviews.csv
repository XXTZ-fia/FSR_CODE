Christine DeLuca,Simply Beautiful!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2U6S5XDVDQ987/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YX79WND,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2025",Color: Genuine MoissaniteRing Size: 6,Verified Purchase,"I ordered a few rings to try from this company. I have large hands with a size 6 ring finger for reference. This solitaire caught my eye because at first glance it’s simple, however if you look at the setting it’s very detailed and not simple at all. It sits high with a two carat moissanite on a thin band, meaning you can play with many different bands with small or large widths. The setting is light but most of the ones made today are, that’s just because of the price of gold. I rather like the lightness of it. It’s silver which means it’s not easy to bend as I’m VERY hard on my jewelry. It lays flat against the finger with a smooth simple band, which makes it incredibly comfortable. The moissanite shines beautifully in any light. There’s a huge difference in the warmth and brilliance of the stone when compared with the CZ. This one I will be keeping.",
