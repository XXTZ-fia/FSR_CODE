I tried 5 cotton nightgowns of various styles and manufacturers.  To be honest I didn't expect much of this one, being an unknown brand and lower price than many.Well it turns out that this is the perfect nightgown.  The fabric is smooth and tightly woven yet very lightweight.  The fit is perfectly true to size, and the lace trim is lovely quality.  The pockets are bonus!  After several sleeps and washes, this one is much better than even others of much higher price.My only criticism is that the color isn't quite true.  Instead of a brighter butter yellow, the color is more of a dull tan.  It isn't horrible but doesn't flatter me.  However, I will happily buy another in a different shade.",

I couldn't find a similar gown that I liked, so ordered this instead. It checks most of the boxes: sleeveless, all cotton, ballet length. It's styled similarly to Eileen West, with a fitted yoke and gathered fabric beneath, so the Medium fit perfectly with my small shoulders and back, and ample other proportions. It's comfy to sleep in on hot nights. It's not as refined in design or workmanship, but it's sewn solidly, and washes well. One bonus--pockets, which West gowns do not have. Overall a great value for the price.",3
