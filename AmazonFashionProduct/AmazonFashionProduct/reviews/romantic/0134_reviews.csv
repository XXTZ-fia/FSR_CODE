I did fail to size up appropriately - I'm 5'3"", 135lbs, 36C and usually hover between Small and Medium, so went Medium here -- could have benefited from a Large in the chest, it pulled taut across my girls and was a smidge too high-waisted (that part's not unusual for me, as I have a long torso). But the thing that was the dealbreaker was the sewing on the bodice under the ""flap"" overlay -- it's sewn ""inside out"" with the seam allowances on the outside. That wouldn't be a huge deal thanks to being covered by the aforementioned flap, BUT there are also bust darts that are inexplicably sewn on the outside too - so they cause weird bumps in the overlay itself and detract from the overall effortless, smooth look.
