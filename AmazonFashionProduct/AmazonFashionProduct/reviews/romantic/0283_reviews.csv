The sizing is inconsistent! It generally runs small. I bought XL for my size M. I liked it, and decided to get another one for my sister. The second XL size jacket came soooo small! It was two sizes smaller all over and much shorter as well! Not ordering the third one just not to risk it. Maybe you could get lucky. It was 50/50 luck for me. Weird.",

How about just Run Away…..!!! As fast as you can from this hideous disaster!!! It came in a tiny plastic bag so smashed it came out a rumpled mess for starters.. it is so thin and flimsy it felt like a windbreaker!!! And this is the good part.. the photos show it coming down to the model’s waist.. when I put this on it only came to under my bra line!!!! What??? And the arms were so short.. overall it looked like an 8 year old boys jacket.. I ordered an xl for an oversized fit.. could you even imagine if I went with my normal size!!!! What a let down!!!! I don’t know what runway this came off of??? Wherever it did, I can’t give it back fast enough!!",20
