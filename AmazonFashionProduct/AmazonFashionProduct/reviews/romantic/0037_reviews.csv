Commenter,Doesn’t work with a bra,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KH337GU45A1I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BQXQWVSP,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 12, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Print Grass Green,Verified Purchase,I love the fabric on this dress it’s very lightweight and comfortable. Unfortunately it just did not work for me style wise. I tried it on with a couple of different bras and could not get it to work. The neck and back area is wide between the sleeves so my bra straps always showed in both the front and the back. I also tried it without a bra and there’s arguably enough support if you need it but oddly it made my chest look small - and I am a 34DD so that is really saying something for me. It might work better for someone who doesn’t need a bra at all. I also think it would’ve been more flattering if the sleeves weren’t quite so puffy because I think that is part of it - overwhelming which chest area. I didn’t think this triangle cut out was pretty cute and my bra did not show through that portion. Of course I wish it had pockets.,
