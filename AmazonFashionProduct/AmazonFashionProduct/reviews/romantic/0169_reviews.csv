klyeoman1203,Just perfect in every way,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GLCQXEW2KVRN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B56D6XFR,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 31, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Mini Green,Verified Purchase,"Omg! FABULOUS Everything about this is fabulous! I'm in love with these. Comfortable and super attractive. The lace is a very beautiful crochet lace....The softness is beyond compare. I bought the red one and the green one. The colors are vibrant. The size spot on. The material is lightweight and cool. It's not stretchy, it's just pure soft cotton. The slash pockets on both sides are a nice addition. I can carry my cell phone and my tissues and even my remote in them. The mother of pearl buttons are nicely done and securely sewn on. I like the extra ruffle at the bottom of the skirt. It has a really nice full sweep. The length is perfect. I'm 5 ft 3 and it comes down to about 2 inches above my ankle. It's just a perfect comfortable soft nightgown that's very feminine. I bought two and I will be buying four more.",2
Cathy B.,Love this nightgown!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31RL6SUJQANOV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B56D6XFR,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 1, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Cashew Flowers,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this nightgown to sleep in while visiting family. I can't stand to be hot at night, but wanted something that won't leave me feeling exposed if seen walking down the hall to the bathroom! This is perfect on both accounts. The fabric is cool and lightweight but not at all see-though. The cut is generous and flowy, long enough (mid-calf), and covers up top. I'm planning to order another one or two in different colors. Very comfortable!",6
Toonces,"Cotton breathable, slightly stretchy, extremely comfortable",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14MQDTEH8DMH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B56D6XFR,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black Flower,Verified Purchase,"I cannot stand the garments that are partially made of that nasty spandex fabric.  This nightgown is cotton with a slight bit of stretch so as to make it very comfortable and easy to wear, kind of like a tee shirt, especially while sleeping.  It might have some spandex in it, but if so, it's a very small percentage.  This is cottony and comfortable, not slaggy and clingy.  It washes beautifully.  I always hang this up to dry rather than put through the dryer, though.  The pattern is adorable.  The buttons are real with real buttonholes.  The buttons have no bearing on how to put on or take off, so I just leave them buttoned.",5
Linda Alicea,BEAUTIFUL house dress with POCKETS.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FG1D6ZTZH6OS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B56D6XFR,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 15, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Pink Rose,Verified Purchase,This house dress is perfect for lounging in the house.  It is dressy enough to have people over.I material is soft and not too heavy.  This is made of polyester and cotton so it’s not as cool as 100% percent cotton.  The print is lovely and you normally don’t find house dresses in this print.  One added plus is this nightgown/house dress has pockets on each side.  You do not know how much I searched to find nightgowns with pockets.I waited to post this video to see how it looked after I washed it.  It looks great.  Was washed in washing machine and dryer.  One note to keep in mind is you want to press it after you wash because it will have a lot of wrinkles.But the material looks like it’s worth it and the price was affordable.,39

I bought medium and I'm on the smaller side of medium.  The fit otherwise is perfect.I have worn this off and on for four weeks and cool water washed it probably three times.  I hang it up to dry for fear of pits shrinking.  Now I notice one seams at the pit is coming unstitched as shown in photo.  My return window is still open so it's going back.  But...I like it enough that I will try it one more time if the price goes down because it's since gone up.There you have it!  I suggest it is worth trying but check all your seams when you get it.",

SoCal Nana,Not Cotton?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R203AHERKYZQTZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B56D6XFR,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 2, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Mini Green,Verified Purchase,"There's definite confusion on the fabrication of this item.  The headline touts it as being cotton, but the item description says ""65% polyester / 35% cotton"".  I was skeptical, as I really prefer 100% cotton for summertime sleepwear, but I ordered one of the colorways to give it a try.Once it arrived, I was further confused because there isn't a fabric content label inside at all.  Furthermore, it doesn't feel like cotton or poly/cotton at all - it feels like rayon.  After washing, I still think it's either rayon, or a rayon blend.  There was some shrinkage, but minor.  The material does seem to get a bit softer with each washing, which would suggest either cotton or rayon.On the ""flattering"" equation - my husband told me that it reminded him of an old fashioned muumuu, and he didn't mean that as a compliment.  He's pretty reserved about criticizing anything that I wear, ever.  It's the length that he especially didn't care for.  I, too, would prefer a shorter hem length.  Should this manufacturer decide to discontinue this SKU and modernize this style of nightgown, I'd recommend finding a true 100% cotton fabric, and making it to about knee-length, or just above the knee.",3

And one thing to note is I have already washed it once in cold water and hung to dry as I do the rest of my nightgowns and it washed up fine. The fabric has just enough weight to it so it drapes nicely without the “ballooning” effect which I’m not fond of.  And I don’t think it will be a problem holding in heat during the warmer months of summer. So far I’ve slept really good in it.  And to top it off this night gown has pockets!
