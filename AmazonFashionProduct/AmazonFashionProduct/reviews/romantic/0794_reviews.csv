Amazon Customer,Size Up,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UIV299PYPK0E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBH1CHT5,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,This dress runs small. I ordered my normal size large and it was way to tight across the breast area. The material and pattern were nice but you would definitely have to size up for the chest.,
Mae,Not for Large chest.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9NXPQOMO2B7F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBH1CHT5,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 3, 2025",,Verified Purchase,I lived this dress the feel of it and pattern is beautiful! It fit everywhere else perfect except in the chest area. Way too tight. Felt more like a medium in chest area. Not an XL. Fabric was very flowy and breathable. Would have kept if chest are fit.,
Rianna,So cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3A9LA9Y8A9YP5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBH1CHT5,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 3, 2025",,Verified Purchase,I'm normally a large or maybe a medium. I did have to send the large back and get an extra large but the dress is so cute. Mine did come with the detailing around the neck as shown in the picture. It's not lined but it's not sheer. The elastic in the waistband/underbust is pretty thick so I don't think it's going to roll or do anything weird. The only real negative I can say is I wish it had pockets.,
Chanthoeun,Love it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KOYKTJPMVI9N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBH1CHT5,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 31, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Pink,,"Crafted from a soft blend of rayon and cotton, this lightweight dress boasts a flowy silhouette.

The elasticized waist and cuffs ensure a comfortable fit, and the bold floral print lends a bohemian charm. Ideal for casual outings, beach getaways, or maternity photo sessions. For best results, steam ironing is advised to smooth out any creases before wearing.",2
Becky La,So flattering,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TGUIBYH7SXHE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBH1CHT5,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 26, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Black,,This dress has a perfect cut and is super flattering.  The slit is just the right height and the sleeves have a nice flow.  The fabric is soft.  The photo shows a pink rope style trim on the neck line and the dress i received had NONE.  But I still love it.,2
