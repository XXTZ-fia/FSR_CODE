Amazon Customer,Pretty but uncomfortably tight in the chest,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZ8HP5AC0WG00/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B94K87HY,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 18, 2024",Color: Dark PurpleSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"I really wanted to like this dress, so much so that I tried it on 4 different times over the 1 month return window, but I just couldn't get past how strange it fits in the chest. I ordered a Small which should have fit just fine based on the measurements, but it was so tight it became see-through when I put it on. For reference, I wear a 32B so this is rarely an issue for me. The worst part is that it's tightest at the upper hem/neckline, so after maybe 5 minutes of wearing it there was a red mark all the way across my chest from where it was digging into my skin. I might order it again in a Medium or even a Large, because the design is otherwise cute and the color is beautiful, but I'm worried the rest of the dress will be too big and hang off me at that point.",2

The sleeves were beautiful and the length was perfect. I’m wearing shorts under the dress which do not show through. The material of the skirt and bodice is thin but not see through. The elastic is a little itchy. The neckline or bustline does not have much definition nor support. However it’s still flattering. I got a ton of compliments at the ren faire. The short length kept me cooler than a big heavy gown and still fit the theme. The lavender color is so beautiful. I’m going to buy another one in another color to put away for next year.,15
