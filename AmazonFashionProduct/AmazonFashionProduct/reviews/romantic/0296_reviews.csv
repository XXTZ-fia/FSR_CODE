M. Miller,Cute dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QXN3LGL91HCB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2QJ7VQM,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 3, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Pink,Verified Purchase,Wore this dress to a wedding. The dress was perfect. I'm 5'5 and 165 and I got the XL because I'm a little heavy on top. I like the adjustable shoulder straps. Fabric is flowy and comfortable. Color is exactly as pictured. A few loose strings that I snipped but no unraveling. Very happy with this purchase.,
