Christina H.,"beautiful dress, just didn't fit me quite right",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FNGEPXS78SDL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08JPY28B6,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 20, 2024",Size: 3XColor: White,Verified Purchase,"I ordered 3 little whiter dresses at the same time for our upcoming Buck & Doe engagement party. I absolutely LOVED this dress when I ordered it & couldn't wait for it to come in. It's even prettier in person! I love the lace along with the chiffon overlay on the bottom- very romantic and flowy. The top bust area is so elegant, the keyhole at the bust is sexy without being slutty and the back design with the straps is lovely. The zipper on the back of the dress is weird and hard to do at first, you really need 3 hands, as the zipper goes all the way to the top and is hard to zip down. I am not explaining it correctly, you'd understand when trying to unzip the dress. Even my fiancé had a hard time helping. Based on bust measurements in the size chart, I ordered a size 3xl. I am normally a size 18 (size 2 at Torrid and size 1 at Maurice's, and very busty!) I'm glad I ordered the 3xl because the waist wouldn't have fit in a smaller size, but the top was a little big on me. Even with my larger chest, the top of the dress around the chest area was a little gappy and laid weird on me. And the length of the top layer was VERY long on me (I'm only 5'3"") but it was like 6 inches too long, dragging on the floor, so I would have to get this altered if I were keeping it, which unfortunately I am not. As beautiful as this dress is and as much as I love it, I will end up returning this dress because one of the others was a much better fit.",

I loved it, it looked really nice on me. The only problems I had were the tail of the dress was entirely too long. I had to hold it up majority of the time. Im only 5'4 so my skirt wasn't too short like others said. The top of the dress doesn't have a built in bra and that was a problem for me. With any plus size dress there should be a built in bra. The zipper would get stuck, so I left it zipped up and stepped into the dress with no problems. The straps on the dress were too weak and very stretchable. I felt like at anytime the straps were gonna break. Thank goodness they didn't. This dress can really be a 5 star dress if a little more effort was put into making it. The design of it is wonderful. Hope this helps!",4

I sized up 2 (5x) sizes because I was afraid my normal size (3x) would be too tight based on some other reviews. I am so glad I did because it fit perfectly! The dress is flowy and elegant looking and the material is soft and comfortable and thick enough to not be see through. I will say, I typically do not have an issue with normal lengths of clothing as I am decently tall, but I did have a couple people step on the back of this dress while walking past me and also had it get caught under chair legs although I was wearing 2.5 inch heels. So just be prepared for that.",8
