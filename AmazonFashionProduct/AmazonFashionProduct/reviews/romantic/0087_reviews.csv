Nakishia,Highly disappointed!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BEBC1N031LLW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P4ZL569,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Just received this dress and I’m very disappointed!! This dress has been worn, it has spots on it, and reeks of perfume. This dress was returned by someone and re-wrapped and sent out to the next buyer, unfortunately it was me!!",
Jenn,Great sleeves,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU7M1A1LRLHAM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P4ZL569,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"This dress is fabulous. I love the fabric and the arms on it. It fits snug and shows my middle, which is why I was going to return it, but decided not to because I cut the sleeves off for another dress. Love those sleeves!",
Lori Ann Richards,My wife loved it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DDDBJUJJ86QD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P4ZL569,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"Right size, snug in the right areas good material",
Kim Pacheco,Good not great,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1A7C60ZGC1WG8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P4ZL569,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,I love the material however the dress twisted in my body ALL NIGHT LONG. It also creeps up on the waist so I spent a good portion of the night pulling and tugging and twisting the seams back in place.,
Brandz,Lovely material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DGLZEOU9VQOZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P4ZL569,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"This dress is well made for the price. Size down for a slimmer fit. Very flattering, especially if you are self conscious about your arms. I wore a great strapless bra but there is rubber over the bust if you decide not to wear one. Got many compliments. Definitely a winner!!!",

Jai,Doesn’t look like the picture,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30NLLGV8X4CBJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P4ZL569,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,Dress fitted nicely but you’ll think when you buy jt you’re getting the sleeves and your not. So don’t buy based off the sleeves only buy if you want the dress! UNLESS I JUST DIDNT GET SLEEVES WITH MY ORDER WHICH WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE IT WAS FOR MY BDAY DINNER AND IT MESSED UP THE ENTIRE LOOK,
Rina,Great quality material.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20ESSP8JDD9TI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P4ZL569,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 16, 2024",Size: SmallColor: White,Verified Purchase,I loved this dress. It fit beautifully and fbe material was great quality. It was not see through.,
Chela,BODYYYYYYY,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LK0NI4F3XET/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P4ZL569,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 13, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,Order it!!! First of all I was nervous it wasn’t going to get here on time so I purchased a back up dress just incase.. and it ended up shipping just in time. I ordered it for an elegant/ sexy couples photoshoot and the way it hugged my body was so perfect. I’ve had non stop compliments on this dress Because it’s form fitting it’s a little tight but the corset portion at the top is great to slip in and out of! I’d probably do an adjustment on the sleeves and disconnect them from the body but overall I’m in love with the dress :),
Amazon Customer,MUST BUY,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M1E9BB0Z3OLX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09P4ZL569,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,Verified Purchase,True to size. Beautiful dress!,
