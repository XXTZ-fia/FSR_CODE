I do hope it will not continue to shrink when washed as I have found that to happen with 100% Rayon products.  It would be best to not put in dryer to keep from shrinking but then you will need to Iron it I'm guessing.  Overall, I am happy with this dress for the way it fits and feels.  I also love the long sleeves as they can be slipped up easily and even look as if I have shorter sleeves.",22

The issue is it will have an unpleasant perfume odor, sometimes ridiculously strong on dresses from Amazon vendors.  I have read this is done to cover chemical fungicide odor, for example. If you plan to keep, give these dresses a good pre-soak in a pale with organic laundry soap and then wash them gentle cycle, cold water, again preferably with an organic laundry soap and you will probably still need a little white vinegar for the rinse cycle.  That's how bad it can be.  Hang dry (because they are a bit delicate), no dryer and no dryer sheet.  In my experience this DOES work and you can enjoy the dress.",19
