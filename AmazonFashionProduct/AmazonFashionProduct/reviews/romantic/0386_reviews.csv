It's just the right length even when I'm flat footed; it doesn't drag. I bought the red and to my please tell surprise, it wasn't fire truck red. It's a nice russet red.

Purple Pony,Wonderful summer dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2809TBRMQ0RJT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CK9P17B,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 5, 2016",,Verified Purchase,"This dress is very comfortable without sacrificing style. The smocking on the back of the bodice makes it very softly stretchy so the top follows and flatters without being at all binding. The smocking of the bodice ends just above the natural waist (unless you have a very short torso), which lets the skirt flow easily over the belly and hips. This hides anything you want hidden while still giving a VERY feminine silhouette.  The fabric is delightfully swishy, thick but light. Rayon has a such a nice drape to it! The down side of rayon is that it can be very fragile when wet, so be gentle with your wash routine.  I got the purple, and the color is very deep and rich.  I am 5'6"" and the hem falls between midcalf and ankle on me. The bottom 6 inches or so is 2 graduated layers of fabric in the same color but differing decorative weaves, these layers are a bit sheer but low enough that you needn't worry about anything scandalous showing.  I typically wear a size 8, the regular ""one size"" fits me fine and I could see it fitting from a size 4 to a 16 or 18 easily.  The bodice does not offer much in the way of bust support but will hide an average bra. The shoulder straps are about 1/2 inch wide and very adjustable. The ""hardware"" on the straps is cheap plastic, which is a shame since the rest of the dress is so nice!",10
