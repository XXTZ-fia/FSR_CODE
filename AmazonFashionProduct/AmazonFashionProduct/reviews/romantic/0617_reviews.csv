CelticBeautyInMyBlood,Beautiful Dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RDNNAI1AKJD9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C5XKFZGZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 26, 2025",Size: 10Color: Haze Blue,Verified Purchase,"My daughter got married and after much research online , I decided on this dress. I bought 2 different sizes because I am a 34DD and the info on the dress said that it ran small so to order a size up. I’m glad that I ordered an 8 and a 10. Normally I’m an 8 but it was too tight in the breast area. The 10 fit perfectly! It’s flowy and so pretty. Very comfortable and it has a sewn in slip under , so it’s not see through. The top of the dress has some stretch which is good if you’re bigger in breast size. I love that it accentuated my waist .",

Color was just as it was described besides this was called a blue but it’s def a turquoise blue you can see that in the picture of the item on the sale page (don’t worry my hair and makeup were done after these photos.) it did come wrinkly but a steamer will get them right out.

It is so nice how this dress is an empire waist and is still fitted but slowly flares into its A-line. It is a very low cut on the bust part so I put a lacy cami under the dress. It does not stretch with your bust so I ordered the size according to my bust size, which was the size 14. (The other reviews on this dress really helped me out too) I was afraid it might be too big but It still fit great in the waist. A size up was a good thing.  The material is soft and flows nice.

I LOVE this dress. It’s absolutely beautiful.  We were inside a hotel’s conference center in central Texas in November. I don’t know what the inside temperature was, but this dress was unbelievable comfortable. I wasn’t hot or cold. The outside temperature was in the mid 70s. The dress is 100% polyester-inner lining as well as the sheer outer fabric.  The dress is true to color. I ordered teal. The entire dress is teal, no secondary colors.  I’m 5’1”, 139 pounds, 36DD, and wear a size 8 in my NY and Company petite dress pants. I’ve been wearing size 8 or 10 in jeans (Arizona Jean Co, Sonoma from Kohl’s). I ordered a size 10 in this dress due to others’ reviews. The 10 fit perfectly. I didn’t think the underarms were too high or tight. Maybe a smidge, but not enough to bother me.  The dress has no pockets :o(  The front on the bust has a vertical seam that caused the bust to be a bit pointy. You can see it from the side in one of the pictures. But again, I didn’t think it was that big of a deal. It’s hardly noticeable-I’m just anal about details.  In the photos, I’m wearing a Maideform T-Shirt bra with underwire. No push up. The straps on the dress are wide enough that you don’t need a strapless bra. And the back is high enough that you can’t see the back bra strap.  This dress is HAND WASH ONLY, and air dry. I followed the directions after wear and washed it in cold water in my tub, and am hanging it/laying it flat to dry. A little bit of the dye washed out when I was washing it-probably normal after a first wash.  I would recommend heels with this dress. I tried dressy, strappy sandals, but it just didn’t do the dress Justice.  This dress is amazing. My friends LOVED it. -Wife",31
