I contacted the seller and they replaced it. Yay! I had the second one dry cleaned and it came back fine. It fits nicely on top and does not cling below the bust. There's a satiny panel in the bust, the rest is a matte finish. The dress is about ankle length on me, 5'4"". The red color is on the orange side, rusty red, which I like. There is a black overdye which I think is intended to enhance the sewn on cord decorations and texture of the fabric. I find it a little weird, but it's so hard to find a flattering fit that I can overlook that. Fabric is medium weight and hangs nicely - not thin, flimsy, or see through. The dress has a flowy wide skirt. The quality of the sewing seems good. I usually wear large to extra large. I went by the bust measurements on the chart and got a good fit with the large on the first try.  I would buy from this seller again.",10

As the name tells you, it is sleeveless. This dress runs a bit small in the bust.  I first ordered a 2X, which should have fit.  It was so tight in the bust, if I had taken a deep breath, it would have burst at the seams.  So I got a 3X, which fits very well.  As usual, I needed to adjust the bottom of the armhole.  But that is very common with sleeveless garments.  Also, the Navy color and Blue 2 look similar onscreen.  I think they are the same color, because I got 1 of each, and I cannot see any difference in the shade of blue.  It is sure to bleed when washed, so I will try to stabilize the dye, so it doesn't bleed or fade.  The tags on the dress are quite honest, and say that there will be these washing issues.",3

The downside is that I bought teal/blue and when I went to handwash it, the dye leaked a LOT. I handwash clothes every week and just didn't think about the fact that I hadn't tested it yet and it leaked to the extent that it ruined two pieces of cotton clothing that it must have been touching and neither oxyclean or rubbing alcohol has gotten the dye back out of the other clothes (one can't be bleached). It's not just a few spots of dye -- the dye is streaked ALL OVER those two pieces of cotton clothing... I haven't had any other clothing leak indigo dye that much (even dark jeans). So it's a nice dress, but don't wash it with anything else you don't want ruined -- it's risky!",27

There was some color bleeding, nothing excessive.  I put the dress in the dryer on Perma Press for 50 minutes & it came out beautiful.  It was a bit big under the armpits & across the chest area, but after wash & dry it modestly shrunk to fit very well.  No ironing needed.  The hem falls mid to lower calf & drapes beautifully & hides my bulges.  These are QUALITY garments, well made, nice flowing quality cotton, not see through & should last many years.  I bought this tank top style dress & another dress with spaghetti straps & frilly flared bottom, which I also washed and I hung that one out to dry & it modestly shrunk also.  I also bought this manufacturers short sleeve top in a 3x and washed it the same as the dresses and am also very happy with that.

LuckyFeather,#1004 summer dress: Beautiful Comfortable design-Dress up or down.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30Q6UYSPJ845X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4H8DL4D,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 12, 2016",Size: 2XColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,"Beautiful and comfortable dress. I normally wear an XL or 1X. I bought the 2X to allow for shrinkage. It fits perfectly after washing in cold and hanging to dry. I am 5'5 and it comes to the middle of my ankles. Armholes are just right, and the neckline is not too plunging, but low enough to show off a nice solitaire type necklace, pearls look great too. Very well made, charming dress for a summer evening concert in the park. I wear it with a nice thin Cardigan over the shoulders. Can also be worn with a light shirt underneath. Amazingly, this dress does not need ironing. Just wash in cold and hang to dry. It just smooths right out. The upper back has several lines of elastic sewn in horizontally, which allow for a nice comfortable give of a few inches.",35

The dye does run, so handwash (recommended) or wash with very dark or like colors.",9
Amazon Customer,"Really cool, but...",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R92GAJ7E6H2BT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4H8DL4D,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 27, 2013",Size: X-LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,"It was shipped and delivered very fast!(4 days total) I like the silhouette, but it's a little snug around my hips, fault of my own probably. It does smell weird out of the package and the smell sticks to whatever it touches. Wash it ASAP, and washign it lets out extra dye that's in the fabric, that could stain skin, clothes, etc. The embroidery is pretty, but there were thread ends poking out of the fabric, simple pulling through the other side and tacking helps. Overall, besides having to wash it to get out smell and dye I really like it.",8
