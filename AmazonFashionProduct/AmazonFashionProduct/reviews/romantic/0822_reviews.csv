I was actually skeptical that I would look good in it but I actually love it. It is definitely short…like that uncomfortable short that makes you self conscious that your jazz is hanging out when you are walking so I am searching for a park of dark blue shorts that will also flow with the dress. I hope I can find some soon because I want to wear it to go dancing and to paint with a twist with my girls. The back area is really just a thin strip to cover your back and bra so I’d do boob tape when I wear it. I have t worn it yet but I know it’s going to be so cute when I finally get the entire outfit together.,
