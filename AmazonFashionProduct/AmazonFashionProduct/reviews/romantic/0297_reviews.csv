Very cheap material and is very prone to wrinkles. I didn't find that it gave a flattering fit but maybe it's just how it sat on me. The way the back tightened and with the front loose it was hard to tie it exactly how I wanted. I managed to get it looking okay from the front but from the side it looked like a maternity dress which certainly isnt what I was going for.,

The tie at the chest makes it easy to customize for weeks where you are heavier or lighter. I would stay away from the versions of this dress that have large areas of solid color as I have the green one and it shows any water drops that land on it.  They wash out by just doing a quick hand rinse of the whole dress in the sink, but that’s still annoying.  The dress with the full pattern (I have the one with the orange and blue leaves and the blue with blue leaves) is better for hiding those droplets.
