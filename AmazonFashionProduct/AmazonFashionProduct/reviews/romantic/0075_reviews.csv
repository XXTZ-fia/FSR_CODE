This dress is beautiful but doesn't look good on me. I'm going to have some alterations done. It's because I'm in btwn sizes since some weight loss. Larger size would be too big and This size fit in some areas but too big in other areas. The dress is not quite as firm as I perceived. It doesn't hold the shape firmly. Maybe after I send to the cleaners. Overall it's a nice dress. Thin but great for summer,

I didn't wait forty years in the dark, just to put it away again. The dress is Grace Karin. Everything I have ordered for my partner, my daughter, or myself, from them has been of the utmost quality. Love chiffon, of course. The skirt length is just a touch too long for me, but of course, my outrageously long torso is probably to blame. The sleeves and last ten inches of skirt are just the translucent chiffon, black, with gold polka dots. The rest is lined with an opaque black material, that feels wonderful inside. The belt is unsurprisingly high quality, as is the collar button on the back side.

This dress could be worn to a party, to work, to church or for a holiday dinner - it's one of those really versatile styles. It is lined and is not see thru at all, and the fit is true to size.  I have a 40"" bust, ordered a size large based the size chart and the fit is perfect.  Loving this dress.",

The dots are actually oval and look very good. The dress looks gorgeous and fits well.  It hits at some inches above my ankle and I am 5 feet.  Highly recommended this GK dress!,
Kelsey,More of a Christmas-y dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18GRXQI0VMRZH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5744WGF,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 12, 2023",Color: Long Sleeve Wine Red-gold DotsSize: X-Large,,"I got this dress (and another) for a couple upcoming weddings. I tried on both and fell in love with the other dress. This one is a nice dress, but not what I was looking for in a dress for wedding attire. My husband and I both agreed that its more of a Christmas gathering dress. Very nice dress. A little wiggling to get in and out. The fit is perfect. I did get the one in red, but really any of the colors would work for Christmas! I do plan on wearing it for gatherings in December.  The feel is kind of like a really close together lace. It has a nice attached slip that is very comfortable. I have a feeling I will eventually lose the belt that came with, but a nice thin belt or long gold chain would go nice with it, too.",
Amazon Customer,Great Dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA2VJNWKUFQ78/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5744WGF,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 10, 2023",Color: Long Sleeve Beige-gold DotsSize: XX-Large,,"I find myself really liking GRACE KARIN products. This dress is just adorable and a very classic style. It is comfortable and fits as expected. I ordered the lighter color, but honestly, I think I would have loved any of them. The gold spots are noticeable but not super glaring on the lighter color. The dress is lined and has a self-belt. The belt is cute, but I may use a belt of my own since I think that can really make a stronger statement. I'm 5'6, and the dress hit me about the same as it does on the model.",4

I have to say gold and black are the perfect match.  The gold leave design pops out every well.  The opening at the leg adds some sexiness to the dress. There is a button on the back to easily take off the dress.  It is not the most soft material, but it goes well with the design of the dress. The bottom part of the dress has two layers, it does not show the under garment at all.",

It is very fetching and feminine. The top does have some detail across the top of the chest. The long sleeves are punctuated with a dainty ruffle at the wrist. It has a belt that adds some shape to the dress. There is a wide layer/ruffle at the hem. There is also a side split, that adds some spice and glamour. The fabric is breathable and comfortable. Overall, you can wear this dress on a number of occasions - from work to play. All you have to do is add some cute jewelry and comfortable shoes. I recommend this dress. 4 stars.",2

BargainHuntress,Great 90s Style Dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1N47QD8FXYQAN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D5744WGF,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 25, 2023",,,"I am very happy with the quality of this dress! When I saw the listing, my first thought was how it reminded me of the dresses that I used to wear in the early 90s! I'm a Gen Xer and still like to wear clothes and accessories from the 80s and 90s. Not only was this dress beautifully tailored, the color was stunning and looks lovely with my red hair! I wear a Juniors Sizes 12 or 14, so the XL was the perfect size for my curvy figure. I love that the belt snatches the waist to create a more slimming effect and it's perfect to wear when you are feeling a bit bloated and want to hide it. You could also wear a waist-cinching belt with this dress, and it's also perfect for autumn weather. I love this dress so much that I want to order it in more colors!",11
