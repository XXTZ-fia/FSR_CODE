Though overall sized correctly, if you're a member of the BTC the girls will get flattened & shoved out the sides. Poor cup design. Straps are in need of removing & adjusting. Lace at the waist line, for mine, is defective. The decorations are goofy. Struggling with wanting to return or do I wing it. Too close to vacay to replace. Something I'd expect from another cheap Amazon competitor.",

I tried to find a picture to show what I mean but it looks like the photographer did a good job at making me pose so it didn’t show. I did have to use strapless push up stick on bra but even without that, the armpit area was at least a size to big — I later ordered the beige one in XL and the armpit area did the same thing but my breasts fit in the dress way better then the XXL.  This dress was very comfortable and light weight. People on other reviews says it’s see through and it isn’t, the only see through part is the way bottom IMO.
