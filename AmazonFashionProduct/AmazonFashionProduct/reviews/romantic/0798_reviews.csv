We tried getting this in the romper style, but it looked too much like shorts. Great outfit and worth the price!",

It’s definitely very close to being too short, but i got away with it. this is also suitable for curvier girls that have large busts and smaller rib cages. The tie allows you to size up for the bust size and then cinch to suit your rib cage. The zipper is good, and the material has a slight stretch to it to allow for breathing room. As far as value for money goes, I would say this dress is priced too high. This feels more like a $20 dress than $40. The fabric skirt is EXTREMELY see through, so the quality isn’t there at all.

The fabric is pretty thin but I could've gotten past that. The color is gorgeous.  My gripes: - The dress fits better off the shoulder. If I put the sleeves up, it makes the chest looser. - Even with the sleeves off the shoulder, there's still so much loose fabric in the chest that I can't wear it. And if I try wear a bra, the straps will show. A strapless bra might work? I'm about a 36B / Medium in bras. - It is SO short in the front. It's got a faux wrap style and where the sides cross, it comes up so high. I'm about 5' 10"" and it BARELY covers my bits. Granted I have a bit of a thicker middle and bum but still.

It looks a little shear but once you put it on it really isn't atleast not in this color. I was unsure of buying a dress off line just because I don't have a cookie cutter body I'm bigger on the bottom and definitely on the thicker side so this dress really exceeded my expectations it covers all the areas I want covered an emphasized the parts I wanted it to. It might be a little short but I am 5'5 and mostly legs so that's expected with any dress for me. I would buy again also when I was deciding on a size I was worried a large wouldn't fit and I would have to go extra large but the dress is very versatile so if you want a tighter look like this l was perfect if I wanted a looser fitting look like some of the other pictures I feel like xl would have been fine but I think it fits perfectly hope this helps,43
