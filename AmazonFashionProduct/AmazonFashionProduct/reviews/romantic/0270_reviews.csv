The zipper is perfect because it really can get you in there if you tried, it doesn’t go anywhere and it’s really sturdy.

However, I got the same style and size in another color from another seller and this one was very tight around the rib cage area compared to that one. The tightness would make it gather up and I had to keep pulling it down throughout the night.",
Courtney Y,LOVELY dress!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PU1M9BE2TW9E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6R31XBY,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 25, 2024",Size: LargeColor: White Yellow,Verified Purchase,"This dress fit me pretty well, however, once I doctored it a bit, it fit me amazingly well! All I did was safety pin some of the fabric to itself - from the outer, upper breast to underneath the armpit. I did use a nude, sticky bra and pull the girls together. It looked fine braless, but I wanted the look of a little more support. I bought a size L which is my normal size. I'm 5'7½"" and weight between 162-167lbs. My measurements are 31"" waist, 41"" hips, 34D/36C, but my love handles are almost as wide as my hips and I still felt super good in this dress. The arm holes are a little tight, but not distractingly so. Before wearing it, I handwashed it, hung it to dry, and steamed it to get the wrinkles out. This brought the dress to another level. I want this dress in every color, but don't have enough occasions to warrant buying them all. 😅 Get the dress, you won't regret it!!!",2

It’s beautiful in person and fabric is unlike any dress I’ve had before- it’s thicker but super soft and almost satin-like. My husband LOVED the fit and style of this dress. The only reason it didn’t quite work is the bust area didn’t quite get the memo that it was an X-Large dress. The dress flows from the waistline but is supposed to be a snug corset fit on the bust. However, the amount of material given for that region created a four-square effect above and below the bust-line (the girlies who know, know). If you are smaller-chested this dress might be perfect for you!",

Besides having too shallow of a cup the chest area is too wide even with the strings pulled all the way in. The material was decent but the dress is cheaply made and doesn’t include a top hook for the back zipper. Overpriced for the quality you receive.,6
Lottie Stallings,Super pretty dress - not large bust friendly,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OG54Y4V92JMN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6R31XBY,"2.0 "," the United States "," August 12, 2024",Size: LargeColor: White Floral,Verified Purchase,"The dress looked great when I tried it on at home, but when I wore it out on my vacation the neckline kept dropping lower - to the point that I kept needing to pull it up, was covering my chest with my hands, and at one point put on a t shirt over. At some point just for the purpose of taking photos I unzipped it from the top a little bit just so it would be a little less tight on my bust - the zipper ended up sliding down, then getting detached in the middle and it fully BROKE while I was out and about. This was my first day wearing the dress.  So while the dress is pretty, I would not recommend it for anyone with a larger chest. For reference I'm a 32G/34H and ordered a size large. So if you're anywhere in that size range (or a sister size) I wouldn't recommend this dress.",3
