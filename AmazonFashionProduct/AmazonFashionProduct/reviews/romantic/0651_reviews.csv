PS Katie,Great price for a great jacket,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OWGQPMW1LRNX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BB4TB27H,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 2, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Multicolored,Verified Purchase,This did not appear 'worn' or used.  I love the color (beige) and the fit is perfect. Even the sleeves are long enough.  I usually wear a size 6 tall and the small fits just right. It's puffy and warm.,
AS,Huge,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R331EA3H5OC5SP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BB4TB27H,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 30, 2024",Size: X-SmallColor: Multicolored,Verified Purchase,"It's nice enough but it's huge. I wear XS or S jackets and the XS was too large for me. I believe it's meant to have that oversized look, but still, it's huge.",
