S & J,pretty dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Z7P0FM4H9U9E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLKXTSYW,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 27, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Navy Blue,,"This dress looks just as pictured. I love the sleeves and the neck, and the elastic around the waist, as this is a flattering style for me, and likely for many. It arrived quite wrinkled, so ironing was necessary. The material is thinner than expected for the price and see-thru, so a slip is required. It runs true to size. I am 5'8"" and 155 lb, 36C and the medium fits perfectly. The slit goes to my knee. I'm happy with this classic dress and will get a lot of wear out of it, I'm sure.",
Kay,"Pretty vibrant color, nice sleeve length",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UYNSZODWE2G1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLKXTSYW,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Pink Flower,,"This is a pretty vibrant pink dress. Not the kind of style I wear all the time, but I have a warm vacation coming up and could use a dose of spring/summer in my wardrobe. One of the things tht caught my eye about this dress was the longer sleeve length. I have fat upper arms so I like to conceal them as much as possible which is tough in the warmer weather as most dresses have tank tops or cap sleeves. This dress comes basiclaly to the elbow which I like a lot. The material is so-so, it's defintiely not cotton, but there was no tag saying what it was made from, just that it was made in china. Feels like a polyester material, definitely synthetic. There were quite a few loose threads from a number of the seams that are easy to pluck out. I did like that the dress had pockets, I dont think I noticed that in the listing. Looking forward to wearing this dress on my trip.",

Morrison,Runs large,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2866YVBBN0VTZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DLKXTSYW,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Blue Flower,,"The fabric is lightweight and flowy but made of a non-stretch polyester that may set off sensory issues for some people. Also runs large, so go a size down. Very cute patten on the fabric and will be comfy on spring days.",

All of the sewing, stitching is very well done and it exceeded her expectations.",
