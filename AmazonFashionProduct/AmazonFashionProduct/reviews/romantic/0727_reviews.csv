I'm what I lovingly call ""soupy"" with all my extra skin. This dress was risky. The cut outs on the side are a perfect opportunity for the soupy skin to reveal itself in all it's glory, however I'm 100% keeping this dress because it looks and feels amazing, soup be damned! It only slightly bulged out, and that could be remedied by moving things around a bit.  I could have sized down for a more body-con fit but then the straps on the sides would have been more like sausage bursting from it's casing.  I love this dress. 5'8.5"" 157lbs (with lots of extra skin) maybe a C cup. If I were as busty as I was pre-weight loss (DDD), this would be a very revealing dress and I would have loved it then, too. ;)",3
