Totally recommend. I'll update with a pic in October on our big day! ❤️,3

A lot of the dresses I had tried just felt and looked cheap and didn’t feel like the dress I wanted for my wedding day, but I also didn’t want to spend thousands on a dress for just one day. I found this one and I was so happy with it! It did require a few alterations as should be expected- I had it taken in just a little, and a bustle added. I did have elastic added to the straps because they were a bit harsh on my shoulders. My seamstress also said she was impressed with the quality of the dress as well. Would definitely recommend!",17

It has the perfect amount of puff and the rhinestones on the front on the chest area are stunning. The dress did fit a little bigger than I anticipated but the company was very helpful with options. I ended up getting the dress altered and it fits great! You will not regret buying this dress!,7

Randall M.,Hip and thigh measurements needed for customization of mermaid style,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ1VWMPVH45M4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CPJ92FV9,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 5, 2021",Color: B-whiteSize: 6,Verified Purchase,"Beautiful dress. I was unsure about buying wedding dress online. Glad I did! Went to bridal shop tried on styles to see what looked good then found similar online. I sent in measurements and they customized perfectly. They should require thigh measurements because my thigh are slightly larger than my hips which makes sitting and walking not easy in mermaid style. But no worries enough fabric to have seams let out. Wish packaging a little stronger. Shipping cut through both bags with a razor in several places, so glad they turned dress instead out. Recommend a sturdier packaging. No damage to the dress. Thank God. (Yes, it's a miracle USPS did not cut my dress). Dress fabric nice. Glad I ordered online!",12

I figured for the price, it wouldn't be a huge loss if it didn't work out. This seller offered custom made dresses at no extra cost so I selected the dress size closest to my measurements and contacted the seller directly with all my specific measurements. They got back to me right away to reconfirm my measurements and then I waited. The dress arrived sooner than it said it was going to be delivered, by couple weeks. It came folded up in a small package so I was shocked by how lightweight this dress was and completely stunned by how gorgeous it was once I unraveled it from the package!!! It fits beautifully!!!!! It looks slight different from what is shown online regarding the lace detailing and layers/thickness of the train but I still love this dress. It is so flattering to my body and very slimming as well. I made some minor adjustments in the back to show the shape of my bum a little more, and shortened the straps a tiny bit because I gave the wrong measurements but other than that, it was perfect!! It was made so that I could wear a 2"" heel with it and the dress would just be long enough to grace the floor, and it has a built in bra! For the value, this was beautifully made and because it was so lightweight, it made it much easier to pack in my suit case to take to Hawaii without taking up much room or added weight! Thank you, thank you, thank you!",4
