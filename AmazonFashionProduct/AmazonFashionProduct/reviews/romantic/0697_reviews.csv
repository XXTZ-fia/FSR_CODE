Getting my refund for the dresses being returned has been a nightmare! I had to file a complaint to receive my first partial refund since the seller never distributed during the time frame. And now on my last returned item of my entire purchase, it’s saying I “received my full refund” when my bank statement isn’t reflecting it. Such a joke.",4
