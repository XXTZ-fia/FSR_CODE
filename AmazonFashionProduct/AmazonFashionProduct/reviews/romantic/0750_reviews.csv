Stephanie Wukovitz,Pretty!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GAWK2FET18LV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001JOV2WQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2018",,Verified Purchase,"I have the same artist's matching ""Scarlet Droplets"" necklace and ""Mystical Femme"" (in garmet) earrings, and this bracelet looks nice worn with one or both of those pieces of jewelry. This is delicate-looking, not TOO challenging to open and close, and I'ved received several compliments on it so far. As someone with slender wrists I appreciate the adjustable nature of this one -- the tightest ring is perfect for me.  After six wearings this bracelet hasn't taken any visible damage (yet?) and hasn't tarnished very much yet, but I know from experience with the matching necklace that a few swipes with a jewelry polishing cloth will bring the light color and shine back when needed.",

Very fine craft and high quality. I prefer smaller stones and it fits perfectly. This is a well-constructed bracelet. It is not cheap looking, either. If you are looking for a fine quality, real stones and craftsmanship this is the bracelet for you.  You will not be disappointed if that's what you are looking for. The bracelet is pretty and dainty; but very well made. Looks better than the picture",

Sam S,It looks pretty with a variety of styles as it is simple,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RT7XFYYTD4F8D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001JOV2WQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 13, 2016",,,"This is a lovely bracelet consisting of a delicate silver chain and small shiny garnets. It looks pretty with a variety of styles as it is simple.  My only concerns: The first bracelet I received lost one stone the first time I wore it. I will say to NOVICA's credit they responded promptly and offered to replace it. Since I had good experiences with other NOVICA accessories, I accepted their offer. The replacement is just as pretty and has not lost a stone. So I am happy.  My only other very minor concern, the bracelet is a little long for my wrist. I close it on the smallest ring but a little bit of chain dangles. This can be fixed by removing the extra jump rings; I just have not done it yet. However, wrist size is variable, so others may find it perfect in length.  All in all, I am very happy with this bracelet, so I still gave it a top rating. I have a couple other items by NOVICA's artists, and they have become a go-to brand for jewelry, decorative items, and gifts. I like their lovely packaging, quality items and their involvement of fairly paid artists from around the world.  I received this bracelet at a discount to review.

Their products are very high quality and their mission statement is just as great as the items that they sell. I decided to pick up this tennis bracelet, and I am so happy that I did! It is absolutely beautiful! It is a very simple design that is easily dressed up or down. It can go with so many outfits, which I really like since my wardrobe tends to be rather eclectic. I work with the public and when I wear it to work, I get so many compliments!  I received discount from the manufacturer in exchange for my honest opinion.
