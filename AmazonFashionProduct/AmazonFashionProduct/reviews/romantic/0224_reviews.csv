I loved it but the price was way out of my budget. I was so happy to see it here at an affordable price.  While it might be pre-loved, it looks brand new.  I cannot wait to wear it.  It can definitely be dressed up with heels or worn more casually with sneakers.One size comment. In the department store I tried on a medium. I am almost always a medium but it felt a bit small. I bought the large and it fits perfectly.",
