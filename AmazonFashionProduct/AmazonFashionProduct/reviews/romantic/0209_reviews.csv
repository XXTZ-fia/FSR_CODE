Shelby P.,,https://www.amazon.com/hz/reviews-render/report-review?ie=UTF8&ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_hlp&csrfT=hPONBBDaLIYermsO5ZG1iDn620wRDeHipBRsko7lToLlAAAAAGeaNCsAAAAB&reviewId=R19SCD11PQWJL6,"4.0 "," Canada "," September 21, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,This dress is like forever 21 quality. Fits true to size. I got this to wear to the Eras tour and it did it’s job. Probably will also wear for Christmas parties. The only down side is that the dye in the dress rubs off easily to light coloured things (like a purse).,
