Sawyer,"Cute, Cool, and Comfortable!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KQC1N4TFM7K1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BMKPV7MV,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 16, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"This top is super cute, while still being comfy to wear in warm weather! Most of the frillier clothes I've found tend to either be too warm or don't cover much of the chest, but the thin material and short sleeves make this a summertime pick if you want something cute yet modest. My only complaint is that the material is a bit too thin, so if you're wearing a bra that contrasts your skin, it's visible under the shirt. I've found that wearing a thin white tanktop underneath fixes that, while still keeping it from feeling too stuffy!",
Mark Weatherby,Just as advertised,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2M70XO3SO6S5L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BMKPV7MV,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 3, 2024",Size: LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,"Great shirt for my needs. Will need to wear a slip or camisole under the white one.  I wish it was button up instead of pullover, but it will work.",2
Wolfspiritt,Sleeves are extremely small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PUZEQ4UX47U8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BMKPV7MV,"2.0 "," the United States "," May 4, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Watermelon Red,Verified Purchase,"Very nice shirt, overall true to the XL size, except for the sleeves. The first time I put this on the sleeves hurt the bands on them were so tight. I had to cut open the seam under the arm along the sleeve to be able to wear it. I did not have time to return it, so I had to do something. Even cutting of the band all the way too, where the sleeve joined the shirt, the sleeves were still so tight against my arms on top that I could only move them partly. The quality of this shirt is very nice, but the sleeves don't match the size in any way. I would not buy it again because I can't move in it. And my arms are just not that big.",9
Tiffany Doherty,Sizing on chart or correct….. too small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WNK884EFSRPQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BMKPV7MV,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 20, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Burgundy,Verified Purchase,I got an XL which according to the sizing chart was supposed to fit me. I could not get it over my chest. Shoulder length was too short as well. Very uncomfortable cuffs on the sleeves. Returned the Nextel day.,6

Jenny Marie,Beautiful Quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QTNWABPQ6NV8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BMKPV7MV,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 15, 2023",Size: X-SmallColor: Dark Green,Verified Purchase,"The quality of the material is very nice. It is thick enough where you don't need an under shirt, but thin enough that it's not too hot. It has laces making it easier to fit no matter the time of day. The laces make it fit so perfect. Get your normal size and tighten those laces up to see how great it looks! I have had a hard time finding true xsmall, and so these laces are great.",16
