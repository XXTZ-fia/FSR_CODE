I had trouble putting it on, and it was tight in the chest, forget making it look cute with the lace up front - but the top of the sleeves that are supposed to be just off shoulder - THOSE are large and baggy. they fall right down. So your top part is tight, your shoulders loose and it is just a hot mess. Very disappointed. IF you choose to purchase this get at least one size larger than you think you need. I think their size chart is off.",

To say this thing tried being a corset when there's nothing but chiffon holding it together was an exercise in futileness.

I headed everyone's advice and sized down to a 3xl I was still worried because I have an apron belly (majority of my weight is at my stomach.) Got it in the mail was able to put it on without messing with the zipper but it was VERY tight on me so I got a refund. I repurchased and got a 4xl and tell me why I can't get it over my head zipped up like I could on the 3xl? Tag says 4xl this was suppose to be for a photoshoot. I'm gonna make it work the best way I can but if you have an apron belly I'd go up one if not two sizes just to be safe. This is ridiculous.  Edit: I was able to get the dress on and it fit. However I cannot unzip and out it on that way. I do have to do it the overhead way and force my 🍒 in the top now the top is more large since I got a bigger raise but I was able to make it work. I still stand my if you have an apron tummy like I do for the sake of not hurting our waists I would recommend getting the size you normally get. And if you need to return it it's very easy and they refund it quickly,7
