I tried a few other dresses and this is the winner. It looked really good with a pair of Western booties. The stitching on the waist does go up kind of high but I figured nobody would really notice. Maybe when I have some time out take those stitches out and it'll look nicer. I ordered the medium and I think it just fit, the large probably would have been a little baggy. Overall I'm very happy that I got the dress, I wore it twice on our vacation and it feels really nice to wear, and I think it's pretty.",3

The size chart only lists bust and waist measurements. Since I fall within the range for XXL, I ordered it. While I can, indeed, get it on my bust and waist, I am unable to pull it down over my hips and butt. If you are curvy and fall around the upper limit of XXL in the size chart, don’t order this. It won’t fit if your hips/butt are much bigger around than your waist. Had the size chart included a hip measurement, I could have avoided the disappointment and hassle of ordering this and now having to return it.",2

Grace Karin always delivers. The material feels light and airy, I haven't worn it to a Ren fair yet but I'm hoping it'll keep me cool on the heat.  The dress has a slip on the inside - on the white dress the slip is just barely see-through, but the skirt covering it isn't, so there's no issue there. I decided to keep the dusty rose colored dress and return the white one, since I only need one at the moment, but I tried both on and liked them both a lot.  Length and fit: I'm 5'9"", about 230 lbs, and this dress is a half inch to an inch above my ankles; it doesn't feel too short, and I think it will look nice with a cute pair of boots. The material from shoulders to waist is stretchy and very comfortable. Below the waist it flows down pretty straight and easily hides any curves I'd rather not show, without needing shapewear. The sleeves don't stay down if I try to wear it off shoulder, but it's cute the normal way so that's fine.

My wife loves cute dresses and when she was shopping for one recently, she came across this Anna-Kaci Renaissance Peasant Maiden Boho Inspired Cap Sleeve Lace Trim Dress and felt it was the right one for an upcoming event.  As for appearance, this dress is certainly pretty and it’s well made. The fabric mix of approximately two- thirds cotton and one- third polyester is also good, and it feels comfy against the skin. Where the dress loses some points is with the sizing. The sleeves are tight and the elastic is uncomfortable, tight at the breasts and hips.  I got my wife the white colored dress and while it is very vivid and bright, and goes with most anything, in hindsight perhaps the off- white would have been a better choice. It’s a matter of preference, but the white is maybe a little too white. Still, it does match with most anything and that’s a good thing.  A pretty, comfy dress does make an occasion better. This dress is certainly nice to look at and the floral lace accents are attractive. You don’t need a slip underneath, as this is not see- through, which is another plus. The only issue is with the tightness. Otherwise, this is a good dress choice overall.",32
