Coolgal,Beautiful Fall Dress with Great Fit and Style,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ICPGZ6WXKFWO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7CQGRBC,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 8, 2024",,,"This dress is beautiful and square neck and 3/4 sleeves give it a flattering, casual yet chic look that's perfect for fall. The smocked high waist provides a comfortable, tailored fit, and the ruffle-tiered A-line design is super flowy and feminine, making it a great choice for both casual outings and dressier occasions.  The material is lightweight and breathable, which makes it comfortable to wear all day. I also love the length—it hits just right for a midi dress and pairs perfectly with boots or heels. The blue color is vibrant and adds a nice pop to my fall wardrobe. The only small downside is that the fabric wrinkles a bit easily, but nothing a quick steam or iron can’t fix.  Overall, this dress is a great mix of comfort, style, and fit. It’s a versatile piece that works well for both casual and semi-formal occasions, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for an affordable and stylish fall dress!",

It’s a beautiful burgundy perfect for fall. I machine washed and hung to dry. After it was dry I put it 5 minutes in the dryer on the lowest heat setting and it was perfect to go. No wrinkles. My only issue with this dress is that it’s a little tights on the hips. I feel like it fits perfectly everywhere else, but I do have side hips so it could just be me. Other dresses I’ve ordered of a similar style I’ve ordered in the same size. So, for me, it runs a little small. Though, if you don’t have wide hips like me it might not be a problem.",

I wasn't sure about the material, but I like it. The dress is a beautiful shade of blue and it is very flattering. In order to get it to fit my waist that is swollen due to medical problems, I had to get an XL, which I usually wear a medium. The top was too big but with the way it is made and the tie in the back, made it work. I'm not sure what they consider the waist on this dress but I'm 39"" in the waist and I had just the right amount of material left to gather around me nicely. I am 37"" in the chest. I would recommend this dress.",
EAM,Runs small -,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23LZULPUMZUYP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7CQGRBC,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 17, 2024",,,"So my first thought on this dress is that its fairly cheaply made which is not a shock from an Amazon dress. The fabric is fairly cheap but not too bad. The dress seems to run a tad small and the shoulders run a little narrow. The seem for the first ruffle layer is in a bit of an inconvenient place. It sits right under your belly so there is a space between the smocking and the first ruffle that really accentuates a belly if you aren't totally flat. Don't expect this dress to do you any favors as far as that goes. If you have some seriously effective shapeware to ware with the dress it helps. I am let down by the dress but will likely still try to make it work for some occasions. If you order, size up.",
Ramona O.,Fits a bit weird in back,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PTISQATTPE5F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7CQGRBC,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 16, 2024",,,"Overall this is a cute dress. The square neckline is nice, I like the length, and the fit is right on. The sleeves are cute and a good length, and I like the color (I ordered the red which is a nice dark red without being too purple-y) However, there is a tie in the back which I'm not sure how to use, I tried tying it looser and tighter and it is tricky to get it to look good. If you tie it too tight it throws off the front square neck fit, but it does feel like it needs to be tied to kind of stabilize the fit in the back of the dress. Other than that I like this.",

Suzanne,"Cute, comfortable, great for the summer/fall transition.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19TU6MAQXPP19/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7CQGRBC,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 11, 2024",,,"I ordered this JASAMBAC Women's Fall Dresses 2024 Casual Square Neck 3/4 Sleeve Smocked High Waist Ruffle Tiered tiered-skirt, smocked-bodice dress for fall, because I loved the deep wine red color.  I found the dress to be quite figure-flattering. For reference, I’m short, a bit above 5’2”. I have an hourglass figure, larger on top. I usually wear a 6 in jeans and a M in a stretchy tee, a L in a button-down blouse or some dresses, depending on the cut of the bodice.  I ordered this in a L because of the bust measurement given in the size chart; it fit nicely, so I would say these run true to size.  The stretchy, smocked bodice fit closely without being too tight. It showed my small waist and figure without overemphasizing my bust, which doesn’t need any additional attention. Being busty, it can be tricky to find a dress that displays my figure while remaining ladylike; this dress is flattering without being too tight or revealing.  The skirt was well cut, staying close to the hips before it started to flare. Because I’m short, I can easily get lost in a too-wide skirt, this was well-cut and not too overwhelming. The tiers of the skirt were well-placed, none of the horizontal seams hit in unflattering places.  The dress did have a slight strange smell when I first received it; I don’t know if it was offgassing, but I put it out in the yard for a few hours and the scent dissipated completely.  I like the dark, wine red color a lot. I have very fair skin and dark hair, with brown/green eyes; the dark red worked well with my coloring. This is a great dress for the summer to fall transition, it’s fairly lightweight but in a dark fall color. Perfect for warm days in the fall season. It should transition nicely into the cooler days of fall/winter with tights/leggings underneath and a sweater/jacket on top.  This dress can be styled in any number of ways. It can be dressed down with sneakers or flats, or dressed up with heels and jewelry. A nice wardrobe basic, great for the summer/fall transition.",
R.B.,ok for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BNDNTC30AWA7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7CQGRBC,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 4, 2024",Color: Wine RedSize: Medium,,"The color and style of the dress is nice but the fabric and construction are just ok. The fabric is soft but thin without an extra layer for a lining. Without a lining you feel the seams in the skirt rubbing against the skin. The length is nice, hitting just below the knee. Found the elastic band on the sleeves a little tight. It's a pretty dress just not for me. Will be returning this item.",

I have an hourglass shape, so my hips are not proportionally bigger than my chest. However, there is VERY LITTLE room in the hips and it does not feel particularly flowy to me, even though the skirt widens further down. It was very strange from a sensory perspective, and I'm really not sure about wearing it longer than to try on. The color itself is really pretty and I think it could be quite flattering on some figures.",
Lisa W,This is a nice dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P4G5XED7DCHZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7CQGRBC,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 26, 2024",Color: BlueSize: Large,,"I wasn’t sure if this Jasambac smocked high-waisted dress was really my style, as I am into the senior years of my life.  But after trying it on, I found that it can be a style for any age.  With the wide smocking and high waist, that gradually becomes fuller as it makes its way down to the hem, it has a slimming effect to it (and I am by no means slim). The Blue color is true to the stock photos, which doesn’t seem like it could be worn in a formal setting, but the slight shimmer to the fabric helps to give it a more elegant look.  Add a wrap to it, and you’re ready for a nice evening out.  One thing I like about this dress is that this style is so different from other dresses.  It is made well; the fabric is what you would expect of a nice polyester, but it is not soft like rayon.  I couldn’t tell from the tag if it can be machine-dried, so I won’t chance it.  It was wrinkled from the get-go, so we’ll see how it does after its first wash and line-dry.  Overall, I am really glad I took the leap and ordered this dress (especially because my husband really likes it on me).  I recommend it.",
