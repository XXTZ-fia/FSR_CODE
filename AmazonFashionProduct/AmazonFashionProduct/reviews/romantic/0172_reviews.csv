The straps are adjustable. The pockets are handy. The loose structure is very comfortable, but not so large that you swim in it. My only issue is that the solid colors (I can only speak for the purple) are a stiffer cotton fabric than the printed styles. The cashew gown is very soft and lightweight, more like a viscose or jersey feel, whereas the solid purple is more like a thicker, stiffer cotton. I suspect it will soften with repeated washing, but after the first wash, it still felt very different from the much softer printed gown. Both are comfortable, and worth the purchase, but some people with fabric-feel issues will definitely note the difference and may not like the solid colors. I guess the fabric could change randomly between all styles, so be aware of that when purchasing.",
