I think it's a perfect fit for what I wanted.  I am pretty petite and was worried how this dress would fit, but I think it actually flattering.  I paired it with a cute white light weight sweater and white sandals.  The pattern is even prettier in person.  And I love that there is hidden side zipper for ease of getting it on. The dress is also lined.",

Lisa,Why this got low star ratings🤷🏼‍♀️,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RORWNNJ1L1UC0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BV1BDQ9G,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Blue Grey,Verified Purchase,"I got a large blue grey floral print and it fit perfect! Nice material, drapes nicely. Chiffon, lined dress. Really cute. I have a big bust so I wasn’t feeling the floral, boat neck fit. I’m more of a vneck girl. But for a summer shin dig.. I would recommend! I’m usually a 12 in a dress. And price point for $40 bucks. 👍🏻",

Fabric is lightweight, great for summer, but has very little stretch.
