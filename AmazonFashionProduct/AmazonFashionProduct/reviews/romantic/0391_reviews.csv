Was nervous at first because there were minimal reviews on the black version of the dress. However I’m so glad i bought it! Obsessed is a complete understatement. To preface I’m about 5’2 135 lbs and I carry a lot of my weight in the stomach and butt area. I do have shapewear on underneath it as well. This dress hugs my body in all the right places, it’s great for girls on the curvier side like myself. The length is also good for shorter girls. I don’t have heels on in my photos. Great quality as well. The underlayer is a little lighter than the original photo but that’s really my only complaint. Definitely recommend buying this!",5
Kayil York,Loved this dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U1GHKYK90VW4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTCFXP71,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 29, 2024",Size: LargeColor: White,Verified Purchase,I got this dress for our baby shower and I'm so glad it fit super well! It is stretchy enough to fit over my belly and not look too big either. The lace just makes it very elegant. The little jacket/arm thing is a bit weird but still looked great! I got a large- currently 150 lbs and 5'9,3
Andy,Bolero didn’t fit right,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWENDJXOJFPUK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CTCFXP71,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 11, 2024",Size: MediumColor: White,Verified Purchase,"Ordered the medium white dress for my wedding reception next month. It was more vintage off white. The dress was stretchy and the length was perfect for me with heels on; I’m 5’1,133 lbs. However, the bolero didn’t fit right and the underpart was too tan where it drowned out the lace outer part. If the underpart was lighter or creamy tan with a fitter bolero it would be perfect because it wouldn’t outdo the lace. I had to return it unfortunately.",

I'm 5' 4"" 163lbs ordered the large, the length is great. Lace is soft and non itchy.  Great bargain!  My only complaint, the bolero jacket needs to be more.....it's pretty skimpy and a little more coverage with the jacket would be nice.  Hence the reason for 4 starts instead of 5.  I plan on wearing this for formal night on my cruise.",2

Both dresses are very flattering and beautiful. Material isn’t scratchy, it’s decent and comfortable enough to wear for hours. I adore the black dress more than the white dress only because of the minor detail difference. For example the straps in the black dress feel more secure meanwhile the white dress straps feel more fragile, the white dress is more neutral color than actually white and the black is gorgeous with the lace being black + neutral tan color. These dresses can be worn for many occasions just wash on delicate cycle and preferably air dry. Would purchase again for sure (:",8

This dress exceeded my expectations. Yes, it's not real lace, yes it's sort of like a For Love and Lemons FP dupe, but it's breathtaking!  I love the simple little bolero, though bear in mind, it won't stand up to a cycled wash.  The nude slip beneath the dress was comfortable and flattering, the V shaped back is exquisite and the little lace patterns, delicate.  The best part? The dress is stretchy and curve hugging without being unflattering. I'm a pretty round medium and the dress that arrived was small. Nonetheless I was able to zip my self in comfortably and walk around easily.  The gown is long but even as a petite woman of 4' 11"" a pair of heels would allow me to walk around in this dress without the need to hem it. My only complaint concerns the straps, which are a bit...cheap looking and fragile seeming. Otherwise this FP dupe is perfect for most formal occasions and in a pinch, a courthouse wedding. The price is excellent for the design and quality. I just ordered myself one in black (sized Medium) and it fits as well, though slightly longer. LOVE LOVE LOVE!",13
