It's more of a purpley orchid color than the mauvey pink in the listing. Still beautiful and I think it suits me better than the color in the photos. It's also quite thin and will need a layer underneath to avoid showing undies!  I'm completely obsessed with this caftan!! It's SO beautiful and so comfortable. The fabric is so soft and weightless, and it really is lovely. I didn't think it would be flattering at all since it's so loose, but the way it drapes helps to highlight my waist, and adding a belt completely transforms it so you could more easily wear it out!  I never want to take it off, I definitely plan to get more colors in the future.",2

The size is half what it used to be, no longer a one size fits all. Sooo disappointed. I am revising the star to a '1'.  ORIGINAL: I love these. I use them as nightgowns. The fabric is very soft and comfortable as such. I will go outside in them to the mailbox or to the garden, but I would not feel comfortable going shopping in them due to the sheerness. I love that they offer such a variety of colors. I wash them using the hand wash cycle but they do tend to shrink up in height. Overall, I would recommend them.",4

Because others have indicated it did not wash well I will say that I washed this on a delicate cycle with other unmentionables.  I started to let it air dry along with my other items but I changed my mind.  I put it in the dryer on a regular setting and pulled it out about half way through the cycle.
