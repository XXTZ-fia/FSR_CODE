Sarahginam,Great dress.. bad price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R159RM4XZC8IKN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B099G38K39,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"This is a great dress, but the price is way too high. This was flattering on my mom; she did need alterations, but it looks great. We did return this though and get it cheaper elsewhere.",2
Brenda Collins,Frumpy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3USOWDIRLMWX4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B099G38K39,"2.0 "," the United States "," August 23, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"It looked like a stiff, shiny housecoat!  Admittedly I am rather short and I think this is probably best worn by someone tall (and slender) but it just looked awful on.  The portrait collar appeared out of proportion - even for the style it is going for.  Very stiff fabric that doesn't move with the body and is uncomfortable.",

The photo also makes the dress look misshapen & wrinkled, but it hangs nicely.  It does run large.  I purchased a size smaller as suggested and it was still large.  I am 5'6"" and it would need to be hemmed (could be a straight hem all around).  I wanted this dress for a wedding rehearsal but am returning it because of size and the collar was not as flattering on me as I had hoped.",3

Winter wedding in January, and it was stunning. Loved the pockets so much. The navy color was perfect. The only downfall was that it had horrible wrinkles. Tried steaming it myself, but ended up taking it to a dry cleaners to get rid of them. Had so many compliments on the classic style. Being overweight, I was worried I wouldn’t find a dress that I felt comfortable in. But for this day, I felt beautiful.",14

However when I put the dress on, it just did not flatter me at all. Plus it’s very tight on the arms and something with the waist makes you look thicker it’s not flattering there.",3
smc,"Beautiful dress, just not for me",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6KTS8WWDJN6N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B099G38K39,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 9, 2021",Size: 8Color: Emerald,Verified Purchase,"This dress is a beautiful shade of emerald green. The fabric is taffeta with a bit of a sheen. The bodice fit true to size but the skirt is very full with lots of slightly stiff fabric which just emphasized the hips of my pear-shaped figure. The dress has a zipper in the middle of the bodice back, placed there I expect to ease getting the dress on and off, but I found it impossible to zip without someone else's help. The dress should have had a front closure.",3
