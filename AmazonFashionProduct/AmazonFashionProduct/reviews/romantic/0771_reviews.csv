O. K.,"Simple, chic, versatile",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2A60XFFZ97OIE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9ZBHVP7,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 10, 2023",Size: 10Color: Black,Verified Purchase,"Love this dress! Exactly at pictured. Very chic. Very flattering nip at the waist, fabric is more suited for fall/winter, a little heavy for summer. Back closure is adjustable so if you button the first the dress is open back, and if you cross over diagonally and button on the second the back wraps to offer close to full coverage. Quality is good as new, would never know it was pre-loved.",
