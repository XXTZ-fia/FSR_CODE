I purchased it to wear to my bachelorette brunch and bridal shower with a fitted long sleeve Pumiey top. The sparrow pattern is super unique to me. It's also the perfect length. I got the M/L, I weigh 165 lb., and I'm 5'7"". The two issues I have with it are that it's completely sheer. I held it up to a window and I could see right through it, so I will need to purchase a slip to wear underneath, and because of that, I think this skirt is overpriced. So just know that you'll need to purchase an additional undergarment to wear with it.",

ReC,Beautiful but Materials and Size may vary,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14K60EDCYOXFZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B098CWMXLV,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 23, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"This skirt is lovely and the design is great. I purchased the lilac/orange as well as the green/magenta flower. Both skirts are floor length with a knee length underskirt. You may still want a slip for modesty, as the skirt and underskirt are both sheer. I usually wear a half slip underneath so that is not an issue.  My lilac skirt is BEAUTIFUL and the material feels like quality. Size varies somewhat. I’m 5’9” with approximately a 30” waist. Size large fit well in lilac but I had to reorder the green one a size up, as the first one I ordered was too snug. I actually prefer the looser XXL waist size. Both move with grace and I get compliments.  Unfortunately the green came in a different material. Still pretty, but underskirt feels like plastic and doesn’t breath at all. The over skirt looks nice but it is not the same great quality and feel as the other skirt. If you are going to purchase, I would suggest that you order a few at a time in case of inconsistent quality and return the ones that don’t measure up.",

Even the lowest setting on an iron will melt the fabric. Spraying with anti-static spray on the sheer layer will stain it a darker color and it's hard to wash out. It was gorgeous for a day!,5
