Unfortunately, the tag lists this dress as being 70% Rayon & 30% Polyester. That is not a deal breaker for me but the other bad part about this dress is the incredibly strong toxic smell that it has. Both my daughter and I noticed it immediately. It's bad. It smells like it's either been drenched in formaldehyde, been hanging out in a car oil business like Valvoline, or from a toxic warehouse. This is for my daughters Christmas Concert and I don't want her to be exposed to these chemicals so it is going back. Why the 2 stars instead of 1?? The dress is beautiful. It seems to have more of an orange color to it instead of the deep beautiful red in the photo of Amazon.

The upper arms ended up being a bit weird on me, so the whole dress slides up a little when I lift my arms. It’s not the worst case of this I’ve had, but it’s something to keep in mind if you have thicker upper arms. The sleeves are a bit tight in the armpit as well and the chest feels a little bit snug, but nothing terrible. The tightness isn’t very obvious to other people, and I can still wear this without too much discomfort. Unfortunately I did size up to combat the issues I saw in some reviews, but it ended up still being a little tight in random areas.  I have a love/hate relationship with the length too. I have to wear shorts or tights under it because it’s easy to accidentally show too much if you bend down 😅  I do like this dress still. It’s quite different from things I usually see, so I’m going to keep it! Just bear in mind that it may not be the most comfy dress you’ve owned.",3

It looks like a beginner embroidery project done with a cheap sewing machine. HORRIBLE and so sad I just bought something from sweat shop workers who probably made $0.10 off of it. WASTE OF MONEY.
