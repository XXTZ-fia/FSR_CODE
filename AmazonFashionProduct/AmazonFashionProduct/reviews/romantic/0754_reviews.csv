Because of my belly I always wear a good shaper under my dresses that goes down far enough on my thighs also as to never make a leg bulge. When this dress arrived and I first tried it on, I was thrilled with how cute it is. Fast forward three weeks to when I was going to wear it in Cabo…this time when I put it on I had my shaper on already, certain it would like even better with the shaper than it had without it. And it did!! That is, until my eyes scanned down to my knees and I realized that the legs in my shaper were longer than the lining of the dress!!!! Urgh!!! It’s too late to return it, so now I’ve got to try to either add to the lining or find a slip. Slips are not easy to find these days and even if I can find one, just because it’s white doesn’t mean it will work with the white liner. So aggravated!!! Of course, I could wear a shorter legged shaper, but then my experience tells me it will create an indention on my flabby legs. For those of you who have toned legs, I highly recommend it- no matter your age!! But if you don’t want much above your knee to show, beware.",

I’m 47, 5’ 5” and weigh 148 with a 36D bust. I purchased a medium in the navy blue. I have no idea why some reviews feel this dress is “boxy” unless they purchased a size that was way too big! In no way does this dress look or feel boxy. The overlay on the dress is unique in my opinion. I can push my regular bra straps down and all looks great. Still have the support of my regular bra without it being seen. The dress in my opinion is a winner. It can be paired with a tan sandal for a more casual look or a nude strappy heel for a more dressed up feel. The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it puckers slightly at the top of the back. It’s not anything to worry about and certainly won’t stop me from keeping the item and wearing it.",24

The second dress I ordered didn't have the funny bits of fabric sticking up.  I will say that I did take a few stitches to tack down the fabric over the shoulder area. Unfortunately the wide elastic looks cheap so I decided to tack the fabric around so that the elastic was covered.  All in all a cute dress for the price.,5
