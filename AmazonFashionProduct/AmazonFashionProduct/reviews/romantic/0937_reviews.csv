I ended up getting three pairs of these, since they were $15, and I wasn’t sure how they’d look. I figured I could just return the pairs I didn’t want, but, as it turns out, I’m keeping all three pairs.  These sunglasses have to be one of the best chances I’ve taken on a random Amazon purchase. These sunglasses are great; they are attractive and fit me well. I wore them all day yesterday, and they were still comfortable at the end of the day. The polarized lenses seem to offer good sun protection, and they definitely cut down on glare as well as some more expensive glasses I’ve owned.  Not sure about the overall durability (they are fairly cheap, after all), but they do feel reasonably well made. I don’t expect them to last forever, but they are priced such that if they break or get lost, I won’t be disappointed. Appreciated the inclusion of a cleaning cloth and a small storage bag. On the whole, I am very pleased with these and will definitely be buying more in the future, especially if there is a style that is a bit more…eccentric…that I wouldn’t want to spend too much on.",4

First, the hinges would barely open without significant force requiring me to use WD40 on the brand new pair of glasses. They worked well after that, until a layer of the lens began to bubble and warp. As you can see from the photo they are completely unwearable as the defect is visible to anyone you walk by.
