Yet the fitting is VERY Odd. I ordered a medium, the top portion is droopy in the back, and fits snug in the front, but the sleeves loosely rest on the shoulders falling to a point where you can wear it off the shoulder, but not because you want to, but because the material is loose, and the sleeves are loose fitting in a way that you may consider going down a size, but contemplate because you can tell that  the type of fabric it is, the sleeves will be drastically opposite, to tight. So the smart solution would be getting it tailored. As out of the way that might be, the dress is REALLY nice, Its worth it.",

I ordered XTRA large and overall it fit well EXCEPT for the neckline.  Both the front and back necklines had gaps.  Perhaps if the dress had elastic there to hold it close to the body it would have looked better.  Also, the satiny part of the dress skirt is way shorter (by 6 inches) than the lacy overskirt.  So, it looks weird on.  I had originally ordered the pink dress and thought the issues were a problem with that particular dress.  Also I didn't care for that shade of pink so ordered another dress in white.  The color and rose pattern were perfect but the white dress has the same issues (baggy neckline and weird hemlines) so it is how that style of dress is made.  Too bad, because I would have loved the white dress it those issues didn't exist.",
