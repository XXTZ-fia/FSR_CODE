There is elastic cuffs around the sleeves to which I just pushed up to my elbows to create a puffy sleeve since I found that they were a bit odd fitting around my long arms. Not quite 3/4 length. Found the fabric wasn’t too transparent which allowed me not to worry. I personally found it quite comfortable and the quality was well made. There wasn’t a smell when I opened the package!! The fabric does wrinkle a bit but I think it’s mostly how I packed it in my suitcase and didn’t hang it up after arriving. The color was spot on from the ad! Highly recommend and I’ll likely be buying more styles.,3

My only issue with it is if you're a woman who has more curves on your body, be it on the top half or the bottom half, this dress is going to be very short in the back and very tight in the top. The bow detail in the back is adjustable and makes the top curves less of an issue but in the back you're just going to have to wear shorts underneath to keep from showing too much.

Personally, I would suggest sizing down especially if you are in-between sizes.  Other than ordering the wrong size, this dress is super cute! I like the pattern and color that I ordered.

It doesn’t bother me, but if you are someone who doesn’t like your bra showing, it’s something worth noting.
