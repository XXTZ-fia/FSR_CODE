Kayla,"Great for spring and summer, even fall!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HFFA7ZSPHVMW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08NJZP3V6,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Swiss Dot Orange,Verified Purchase,"I liked all the colors that were available, they were all complimentary to spring summer and fall! Great versatility. As I was looking for an outfit that I could wear for church choir, that was conservative, demur pretty whatever the kids are saying these days ... It checks all the boxes. I sized up to have a more relaxed fit, but true to size as a medium, I found that it fit nicely with just a little bit more pull at the chest. It pairs well with a cardigan, jean jacket, leather jacket, Blazer, or worn by itself. Easy to clean and to steam if a few wrinkles occur. I'm a little concerned that the longevity of the material won't cut it for long, but considering the price and value, it's hard to pass it up.  So overall, the material quality is suspect when it comes to how long it will stand up over time and with washing etc. It has a little bit of give and stretchiness, and is nice and light material thickness, perfect for warmer weather and for layering. If you purchase a color that is a little bit more see-through due to the thin material, I recommend using a nude slip, that helped me to avoid flashing people when under stage lights.",2

Material is lightweight but full coverage. Seems to be decent quality. It was pretty wrinkled straight out of the package but that’s to be expected. Hang it up in the bathroom for a few days and the humidity from your showers should help smooth it out. I’m 5’9 and fluctuate between 140-145lb, and last time I wore an evil tata containment system I measured around a 34DD. Small fit me pretty well. I do have wide shoulders, so it was a bit snug when pulling it on, but once on it was fine. No zipper, no pockets (women want pockets!!). My friends and I did think the belt was meh and needed an upgrade to something that contrasted a bit better. This is definitely more of a late spring through early fall dress, I don’t think it would be thick enough for cooler weather. You’d need to wear leggings under it to stay warm and it’s not really the right style for that.",

I honestly think I could’ve ordered a L and it would fit better but I don’t have time to do the return and receive a new one and I’m scared it’ll be much smaller. So with that in mind, there’s about 2 inches of extra room at the waist line. Can probably get it fitted and problem solved. Also, since I’m 5’3, it comes down to about 5 inches above my ankles, so it IS a weird length. This may work best for a tall person. It’s cute. Just, not my favorite. Might return it.",
