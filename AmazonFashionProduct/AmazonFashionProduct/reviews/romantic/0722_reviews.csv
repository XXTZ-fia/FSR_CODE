Jolene,Order a size bigger than you need,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29RCAWO29QRIJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CCDS5LNT,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",,Verified Purchase,I had to do some major tailoring so that it would fit. Very very tight around the bust. The rest of the dress fit fine but if you have some big to the larger breasts you might want to order a size or two bigger. Otherwise it's cute I used to play Lucy Ricardo and it was very cute. Kind of expensive for what I think you get but that's a different story,
