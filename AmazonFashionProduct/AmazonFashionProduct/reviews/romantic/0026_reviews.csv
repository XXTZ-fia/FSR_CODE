Shaq-Dev B,Color is amazing but the fit is off,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22V7D559PON73/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BG4YGZP8,"2.0 "," the United States "," November 13, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Orange,,"I rented this exact dress via RTR. The color is amazing and the fabric feels lovely. Unfortunately, the fit is completely off. The bodice is extremely tight (could barely get the dress to ship up). The front is a plunging vneck. Even with boob tape, I couldn't quite get the dress to fit right. The top with the deep v neck was too loose, despite the waist being extremely tight.",
