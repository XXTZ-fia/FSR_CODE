It fits true to size. If you have a bigger chest, I definitely do not recommend this dress. I tried to wear it without a bra and that just was not an option and then I put on a topless bra and you could see the bra. I got this for a destination wedding and had no choice, but to wear it with my bra showing which looks awful. I refuse to be in my family picture. Zoom in to see what I'm saying. If you have a small chest then it will be perfect!",
