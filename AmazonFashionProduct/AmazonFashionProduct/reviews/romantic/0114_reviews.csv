We ordered the xlarge because she didn't wanted it pulling on her in the chest area and it fits perfect. She is 5'3"" and the length comes to just above the ankles.  I was a little concerned because the pictures sent in by the people reviewing the dress were not the pictures of the dress being offer. And I didn't like the dress in the reviewed pictures. This dress was as pictured on the offer and it is beautifu. My daughter loves it very much.",

Madison Pierce,Fit was amazing. Quality check was bad..,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23HP8YXVF5RP2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4B97KNV,"2.0 "," the United States "," September 5, 2022",Size: X-LargeColor: Pink,Verified Purchase,Let’s start off with the good things. This dress fit my body perfectly. It looked so adorable & i was planing to wear it to a wedding soon. The color was adorable as well.  The first thing i notice is that the right sleeve ruffle was hanging down lower past my chest while the left sleeve ruffle was sticking out sideways. (The first photo I attached shows this with a close up on the second picture.) picture 3 shows me holding both sleeves out. The right side is over an inch longer that the left side.. this was sadly poorly made & not checked.  Im so bummed it didn’t work out for me because it truthfully was so cute but it was way too lopsided to work with.,11

This dress actually exceeded my expectations. The quality of the fabric (I got the black dress) is great, the stitching is great and the sizing was exactly as they indicated in their guide. I find it flattering on my figure and I’m a bit of a hard fit. I’m 5’ tall and about 130lbs, I ordered a large. The bottom hem comes to just below mid shin on me. Yes, there’s a bit of wrinkling in the fabric upon delivery. I threw it in my dryer on the “steam refresh” setting. Twenty minutes later it came out perfect, wrinkles from shipping were gone. It’s a fun, flirty and flattering dress that’s suitable for many occasions. I love it so much I just ordered another one in a different colour.",
