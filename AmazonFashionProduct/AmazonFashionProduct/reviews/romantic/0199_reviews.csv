Michael Nguyen,Cheap and Unflattering as Maternity Wear,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38F23KDILQ2D9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCSBS3F1,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Color: White01Size: Large,Verified Purchase,This dress very cheaply made and feels like something you would get off of Temu. Most of the dress is a cheap mesh that creates an itchy sleeve around the elastic top. You could probably find a higher quality dress at forever21 for half the price. The fit is also unflattering as maternity wear on my body as the trim detail bulges around my thighs making them appear wider than they are. Maybe an X-Large would have been a better fit for my belly.,

I'm 75 years old I don't know that I would look that great in the empire waist. It also says it has Bell sleeves as you can obviously see from the picture it does not have bell sleeves. I am wondering if I return this one and buy another one at the same size with a waist hit me in the right place. Just wondering because the picture is so very wrong.,

After this, I washed and sold the dress to another bride-to-be. The fabric is light and airy, since it's lace you need to be cautious and wash gently in cold water and air dry, or dry clean. It was see-through where necessary and the underdress was not too sheer. It does not easily wrinkle and could be worn for many occasions. It's so versatile, but not my usual style.",12

You can't even zip the dress up when not on your body and difficult off your body. Plus it looked too small.  So... I ordered a medium,  off shoulder dress.
