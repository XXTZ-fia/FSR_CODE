The material didn't feel great,  and as an extremely oversized sweater,  felt like the entire thing was just being pulled down by the weight on the knit. Very poorly fitted. More of a dress than a sweater.",

Sarah,Very long,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RS59FP57XG0M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9ZC73V4,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 9, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Multicolored,Verified Purchase,"The sweater is acrylic/wool so it is a bit itchy. Well cared for but you can definitely tell it’s used. The width and sleeves fit nicely, but it is a VERY long sweater. I ordered a medium and I’m 5’4”. The front came down a couple of inches above my knees and to the bend of the knee at the back. If I were taller I would keep it.",3
