It looks much like the sample pictures, and there weren’t any huge surprises when it came to fit and texture. Not too thin/lightweight, and it is very soft. It does have that classic convenient-and-cheap-clothing style that Amazon typically sells (you likely know what I mean if you’ve bought items of clothing from Amazon sellers before).  Two major concerns for me: 1) there were already appearance issues when it came to the velvet itself, like it was exposed to high heat and then some of the velvet got crushed/melted into that shiny sadness that can’t be fixed.  2) Every inch of skin the dress touched turned purple from the excess dye in the very-black garment. I was looking like Violet from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory! Not good. Will return :(",

The waist of it rides up above my waist plus the skirt fabric looks and feels like a heavy micro fiber bed sheet.  The gathering of the heavy fabric is probably the most unflattering of the dress. To TOP it off my dress, I think was a return as it had what looked like white deodorant on the front of it and covered in all kinds of hair and lint.  I had just gotten out of the bath when I tried it on, so it definitely was not my deodorant.  It also took a long time to receive.

I'm 5'6"", 34D bust, 26"" waist, long torso, and a size 2/4 for reference. I ordered the size S and it is true to size. It's a fitted Cotton/Elastane blend upper with an A-line style Lyocell/Cotton blend bottom skirt that feels soft and silky while on. This will look fabulous on all shapes/sizes. The black is perfection and will be such a versatile wardrobe staple this coming fall/winter. It can easily be dressed up or down. It just has that great fit and lux feel with that ""old money"" appeal. I just can't help but feel like throwing on some pearls and sipping on a martini while looking chic and sophisticated in this little number - lol!!",4

I love how versatile it is and can be worn in different seasons.",3
Truly,Follow the size chart.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FV2AQ4WUG3UR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4TPFN3N,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 17, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Solid Beige White,,This is two different textures. The top is like a soft cotton ribbed texture and the bottom is more like a sheet texture that wrinkles very easily. I don’t do irons and it doesn’t come out well just by using the dryer. It is likely true to size because it is too big for my daughter who generally takes XS. We took a chance since the model was wearing a small and she is 5 inches taller and 15 lbs heavier then my daughter. The dress did not come down to the models  ankles and we wanted it to so it seemed like it would work since the model is 5 inches taller but it actually seems the same length as on the model. It also was too big at the top but it seemed right on the model like it stretch so it was just really our fault since my DD is more like a zero.  The smallest size they have is 3/4. I will say if she takes the sleeves down and ties them in the back it looks nice. Haha. But if you get it too big it just looks like lumpy so I recommend really following the size chart.

Lee Familia,"more of a casual look, not quite ""wedding"" fancy material",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3C9OJK6OF3V6J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4TPFN3N,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 12, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Solid Khaki,,"I am 5'4"" at about 120lbs so I ordered this dress in a size small. This fit my average torso just fine, with the length of the skirt falling below my knee. There is no lining for this dress and the price shows at $38. The seams are completed with care, so the quality is considered good imho.  This would make a nice fall dress to wear casually. The top material is thin and stretchy, so a bra with good padding is recommended.",10
BruceH,Comfortable dress for casual occasions,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1O0GKDS3CE5Y6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D4TPFN3N,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 9, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Solid Light Green,,This fress works well for cool summer even / fall day. There is no lining so can be translucent so be aware of underclothes. The lower dress portion wrinkles easy so needs to be ironed / steamed after washing. There is an elastic waist which will limiting life of fit. This comfortable dress is true to size (approximately 46 inches from neck to bottom) and has a high neck with two side waist pockets. The top is form fitting and can be a little warm but manageable for an informal event. Overall quality is it will last the season but will be limited due to the elastic waist. Overall a very nice casual dress.,10

The solid color adds a touch of elegance, making it suitable for various occasions, including weddings and as a wedding guest dress. What I love most about this dress is its flowy and bohemian style. It effortlessly drapes around the body, giving a relaxed and comfortable feel. The material is soft and lightweight, perfect for all-day wear. The dress is true to size and the fit is flattering. The long sleeves provide extra coverage and warmth, making it ideal for cooler weather. The midi length gives it a sophisticated look, while still maintaining its casual and laid-back vibe. Overall, I highly recommend the Casual Long Sleeve Dress. It is versatile, comfortable, and stylish. Whether you're attending a wedding or simply want a chic and bohemian look for a casual day out, this dress is a great choice.",2

It is definitely the color for me. It is beautiful like a mint green, but not too dark and not too light perfect for my skin tone. The material is super comfy. The pictures I posted have wrinkles in the dress, but they fall out very easily, when you wear it, it would be best to wash on delicate and let air dry. Highly recommended.",5

It will be warm yet breathable while I’m doing dance moves during the reception.  The directions say to hand wash this dress. I machine washed it with a load of stuff. Then I tumble dried it for a few minutes, to calm down the wrinkles before I air dried it. You will need to iron that flow-y full skirt.  Additionally, the 6 color choices tempt me to get a second dress. I think it’s relatively unique looking.",

The waist sits just a little higher than natural waist but not so high that it's empire or babydoll-looking. Very flattering and forgiving. The sleeves are long enough. Yes, I know I already said that - but you have to understand: THE SLEEVES ARE LONG ENOUGH. I am 5'11"" and it fully covers my wrist bone. Hemline is midi, not maxi or knee-length. Love it. And there are pockets. Love the fabric of the skirt - feels almost like a starched sheet, but softer. The bodice is a fine ribbed knit that hugs without binding or being too revealing. The color between the two fabrics is indistinguishable. Great dye match. Would absolutely order this again. Wish there were 15 colors!",2
