I hang it up to dry for fear of pits shrinking.  Now I notice one seams at the pit is coming unstitched as shown in photo.  My return window is still open so it's going back.

It is a very bright kelly green. Pretty color. Just not the more subdued green I was expecting. I am impressed by the quality of the fabric, the softness, and the sizing. I am 5ft and 155lb. I ordered a XL because I wear a medium or large. But online shopping has got me in the habit of buying a size larger. I will say that this gown is true to size with a bit of room. So order the size you wear. And it will be just enough roomy so you don't get wound up in it at night. Or if you want an exact, more fitted feel. Order one size smaller than your usual size. It's comfortable and so pretty.",
