Based on reading some of the reviews for this dress, I ordered an XL to be sure it would fit. It is SO small and has 0 stretch. To me, it fit like a S-M. The middle seem (that I am highlighting in one of the photos) is so tight… on a flowy dress I’d expect that seem to have tons of room to flow, but it had about an inch of room off of my body. It was so awkward to wear. I told my husband I felt like a sausage in a sausage casing with it on… I never expected to feel that way in a flowy dress. The model makes this dress look fantastic, but I’d say you’re better off trying something else.",

Pamela F.,The hem length was way longer in the front.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TI1PTA5UQIHX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BNM7S8VC,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 4, 2024",Color: RedSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"I loved this dress! But I tried to wear it and the front of the dress dragged the floor while the back was the perfect length. I decided to compare the front length to the back length and at its longest, the front was 4 inches longer than the back. I’m so disappointed. I loved the way it fit. I would’ve liked to have exchanged  it with another one (to give it another try) but it didn’t give me that option. It only allowed me to return it. Then I have to buy it again as a separate transaction and the price is now higher than what I paid for it a few days ago. I love the way it fit but because the hem was so off, I’m only giving it three stars.",
