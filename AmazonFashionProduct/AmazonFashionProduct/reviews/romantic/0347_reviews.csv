That was a mistake. I should have looked closely at the pictures on the page and noticed the thin model's dress hits well above the knee, but the larger model's dress hits AT the knee. They used the exact same fit model and just scaled it up, as if all larger-bodied people are tall. If the dress had no shaping whatsoever, that would be adaptable, but instead there's a narrowing at the ""waist"" of the dress that hits where my hips are and then flares out again and the pockets are at mid-thigh, which is both unusable and unflattering.",
