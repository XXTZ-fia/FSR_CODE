The glittery outside looked itchy, but the dress is fully lined on the inside, which I wouldn't necessarily expect from a dress at this price from Amazon. I am 5'5"" and normally a size 6-8; I ordered a size 10 and it was maybe a teensy bit too large, but I think it would have been snug if I sized down.

The glitter in the dress is just like the picture and makes you feel like Cinderella. The skirt does have a little structure to it, but is not as voluminous as shown in the pictures. I was a little nervous about the thinness of the straps, thinking they may pinch on my shoulders, but the dress was very comfortable to wear all day long.  As someone with a larger bust it is always a gamble buying a dress online, as many of them are too tight. I ended up ordering the size 12 (I'm 5'8"" and wear a 36D), and the dress fit well. I probably could have even gone down a size to have a more push-up look.  Overall this dress was the perfect thing for a special occasion, and I would recommend it!",3
