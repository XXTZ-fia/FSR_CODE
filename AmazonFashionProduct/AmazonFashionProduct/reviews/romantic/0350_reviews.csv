Cara,Cute plus size dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36MY16WNLF05C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CY8R88X4,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 14, 2024",,,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a dress girly. Being extra fluffy, I just don't feel comfortable in a dress. I wanted something i could maybe wear on vacation. I didn't end up wearing it bc im too self conscious but it's a pretty dress. It's pretty flattering bc it ties around the waist. I usually wear a 2-3x and this fit almost perfect. A tad snug around my chest but nothing terrible. It's a nice weight material. Not too thick or thin. I'm short at 5 ft 1/2 inch and it went down to my ankles. The bottom of my ankles. 😉. Didn't drag ir anything though. It's really cute. If I can get over myself I may even wear it in public one day😆",

Jen Costa,"It's a great dress, just not for me",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SUJ8H1H7UQ9U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CY8R88X4,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 11, 2024",,,"This is a great dress, I just didn't like the way it fit me.

SLMains,one of my favorites,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17ICHSNMKPNTH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CY8R88X4,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 27, 2024",,,"This KIMCURVY Plus Size dress is one of my favorites! I wear this at least once a week. Every time I feel phenomenal. The fit is perfect. The hem line comes down to about mid-calf, but does not make me look like I'm wearing a mumu. As a short, thick gal...IYKYK.  The banding throughout the body and skirt creates movement while highlighting the small of the waist. The simple style makes this dress versatile. I have worn it for every occasion from the beach to a corporate meeting, with accessories anything is possible. Even with *almost* full coverage the dress is lightweight. In 90 degree weather I was comfortable and not drenched in boob sweat. Going braless is a safe bet too because of the full coverage bodice. No nip slips here!  Seriously, this dress is so feminine and flirty. I feel like a babe every time I put it on. It's truly effortless.  5/5",

It was too long for me. (I'm only 5'2"".) It just wasn't worth hemming as I really didn't  like the polyester fabric-It reminded me of a crinoline. Very non breathable and makes a sound when wearing.

The quality is pretty good, it didn't pop any stitches putting it on.",
