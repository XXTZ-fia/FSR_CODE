JW,Very cute and the weight is multi-seasonal,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25ZAG9LX6O9IP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9Z9ZKF6,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 18, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Red,Verified Purchase,"This is adorable on. The color is slightly more rust-tinted than the picture indicates, but it's pretty.  The weight/fabric is nice because it's less of a heavy sweater and more of a light fleece. So you could layer it for more warmth or just enjoy it on cool fall days.  It fits more cropped on me than on the model, but not in a way that makes it unflattering or flashes skin. Just hangs a little shorter in the front, so maybe that's just from being bustier than the model!",3
