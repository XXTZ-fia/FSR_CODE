The size was a bit of a disappointment, entirely my own fault for not checking the listing carefully. I'm not sure it is worth the cost as a candle alone, but since you can re-use the jar (love that drain hole feature!) I would say it more than makes up for that.",

The candle is small and cute, with a great aroma that isn't overpowering. It burns slowly, filling the room with a scent that makes it feel like a spa or massage parlor. She loves the clean and calming atmosphere it creates.  One of the best features is that the concrete jar can be converted into a small planter once the candle is done. It even has a drainage hole at the bottom, which is a genius touch. This dual functionality makes it not only a lovely candle but also a practical and eco-friendly item. Not sure if she'll use it for plants or actually refill it with soy wax a few times first since it makes such a nice minimalist candle to have. Overall, my wife thinks it's a fantastic idea and would make a great small gift for anyone.",

I put my fingers in the shot to show scale a bit. I think it’s a cute concept that you can truly use this as a little planter with the hole at the bottom, once the wax melts down. By now we know most candle vessels can have a second life, but this is the one unique quality of this one: its drainage hole. Whether or not you think that’s worth it for the price is totally up to you. I think this would be a cute gift for a succulent loving friend or family member! The candle/ planter seems well made. It’s thick and has a nice weight to it. I haven’t lit the candle yet, but I will update if it burns too quickly. All in all, a cute and unique little candle.",5

I really was excited about the fact that, once you burn the candle, this can be used as a plant pot. But I failed to read the dimensions, and it is only 4 inches tall and 3 inches in diameter.

The fact that it is a really awesome functional planter is what really makes it for me, it would make a perfect gift for someone who likes candles and plants and a succulent is very happy in it thanks to the generous drainage hole.

I'm impressed with the quality and thought that went into the design of the black concrete holder so that it could enjoy a 'second life' as a small planter once the candle is consumed. As a candle, it's got a nice, pleasant sandalwood scent that isn't too overpowering and the soy wax burns cleanly without soot or smoke. It's highly giftable as is, with a sturdy box and black ribbon, and looks great all by itself. The lid doubles as the base for the holder while burning and later as a small drip catcher/saucer when it converts into a planter. So far, it's fulfilling its first life as a scented candle quite admirably, taking about 10-15 minutes to fill an average-sized room with scent once lit. On the underside, you can see the drain hole and the cork plug waiting patiently for when the candle is done. I was impressed with how completely the candle burns down and consumes nearly 100% of the wax and all you have to do to convert it into a planter is use a pencil eraser end or something similar to push the cork plug out and voila! The drain hole's size is just right to work with the slight taper of the now-empty candle holder but not so big that it causes soil erosion. You can choose to keep the plug in place if you desire depending on the type of planter you want it to be. Mine will be home to a small cactus so the drain hole will be left open to prevent root rot.",
