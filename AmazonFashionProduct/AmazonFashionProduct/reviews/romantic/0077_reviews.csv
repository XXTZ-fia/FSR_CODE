The fabric of the main dress is opaque so I don't have to wear a slip, and the dress has pockets, so bonus points for that. However, the pockets are small and can barely hold my phone  The embroidery on the top panel is *itchy*. I could take it to a seamstress and get it lined with a fabric that matches my skin tone, but that would probably cost as much as, if not more than, the dress itself. So I guess I get to deal with the itchy embroidery  Speaking of the mesh panel at the top: it tore in multiple spots after maybe 4 washes and I followed the washing instructions exactly. I am not impressed  Another problem is that the tie wasn't sewn evenly when it was put on the neckline, so I have barely enough fabric on one side to tie a bow in the back, and an extra 9 or 10 inches on the other side that hangs awkwardly from the tail of the bow. Not really a great look  I'm busty, so I had to size up, but the waistline still doesn't hit my waist; it's about 3"" higher so it makes my waist look wider than it is. The dress is supposed to be A-line but the way it lays, it looks like I'm going for an empire waist. If I had sized up any more than I did, I would have been swimming in the dress, though  0/10 would buy again. It'd be nice if I could get my money back, to be honest",12
