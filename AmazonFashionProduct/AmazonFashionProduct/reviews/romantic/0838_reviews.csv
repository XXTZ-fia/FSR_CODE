Sadly this just didn't work for me as the dress is much shorter on me than I expected.  I am 5'7 with a longer torso and when I put this on it comes off as almost a minidress, which doesn't match the look of the dress or style of clothing that I would wear at my age.  I would recommend this for petite women, but not for taller women.  The skirt portion of the dress is also slimmer and les structured than the top portion of the dress, so if you are top heavy or slimmer through the hips, this won't look balanced.  This is a dress that will be more flattering for curvy pear shapes and less flattering on apple or triangle shapes.I ordered this dress in a size XL and it is roomy all over.
