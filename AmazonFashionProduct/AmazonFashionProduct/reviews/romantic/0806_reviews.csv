solartj,Didn't look like the photo,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DGC3ZULIKMPO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0921KSGQJ,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 27, 2025",Size: 3X-LargeColor: Light Blue,Verified Purchase,"I ordered the Light Blue version of this dress. In the photo you see the flowers flow down from the top and up from the bottom with shadow looking flowers in the center. That's not what you get. There is a section at the top with flowers and a section at the bottom with flowers and pure white in the middle. It looked very weird. The white liner you see peeking from under the dress in the photo was at least 4"" longer than the actual dress and made me feel like my slip was showing and I needed to shorten it. The dress and jacket fit but I doubt the fabric would last more than one or two wearings unless you're very careful with it. I returned this dress.",

There is a drawstring in the back that takes in the waste without looking like a belt. The fabric is not as silky as I thought it would be, has more of a texture but still love it. Steamed it in the dryer for 10 minutes and it was good to go. Have not washed it yet.",
