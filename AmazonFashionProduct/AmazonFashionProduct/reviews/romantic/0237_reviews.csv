I did feel like I needed to wear shape wear with this dress because it is so fitting you need “shape” with this in order not to look boxy. Wearing shape wear made a world of difference when trying on! The bottom layer of the dress was constantly shifting from the top lace part this is the reason I chose a different dress to wear.",2

If you have a heavier chest you’ll notice the cheapness in the straps as they’ll stretch out. Wouldn’t wear this in the colder months the static was causing the lace overlay to ride up which definitely added to the cheap look. This one was a flop.",

Wore this for a bridal shower and was perfect! Hugs the body just right. Very flattering of curves. Stretches nicely. The lace shrug doesn’t have quite as much stretch. Down a star because one seam did tear fairly easily the first time I wore it but wasn’t super noticeable and I think I can mend easily. Looks so much more expensive.,

The price was good, and I only needed it to wear under a skirt for an outdoor event in Ireland. The lace cover was a bonus that I ended up using when taking photographs in just the dress by itself because it wasn't very warm out. It was thin like a slip, and I wore it as such, and even though it is described as being a formal gown, I would not have been happy if this was the only thing I was wearing. It was already torn on one side right out of the bag, and when I went to adjust it for one of the photos, it tore again. The straps are adjustable, but still very thin. Again, this would be the perfect gown for something you might expect to get dirty or wet in, and I can imagine it would photograph well.",3

I had no idea how hard it would be to find a white dress that wasn’t see through. I kept scrolling past this dress but figured the quality wouldn’t be great considering the price. 5 days before my shower, I figured I had nothing to lose. I was prepared to wear a black dress at that point. Turns out, this was the one! The first one that came had a small hole in the back on the lace layer. Amazon replaced it quickly, I got the replacement the next day and it was perfect. My cat ended up pulling it off my dresser while I wasn’t home so it sat in a pile on the ground for a couple hours and didn’t wrinkle at all. The only thing I didn’t love was the back - it’s the stretchy tube top material. But my hair is so long that it covered most of it. Otherwise it was absolutely perfect. The inner layer is nude colored so no chance of translucence. I got so many compliments. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a bridal shower dress that makes you look snatched for less than $50!

I am 5’7 and weigh 140lb. I was worried a Small wouldn’t fit however it’s perfect sizing. It’s not to think or thin and is fairly comfortable. I can move in the dress without it feeling like it’ll snap. I think the quality is really nice for the price and it looks great. An amazing dupe.",

And the photos they have on this listing are screenshots from house of CB photoshopped change the back to what they’re selling. It’s not the same. It’s not padded and it’s not super duper high quality. But… I think I look pretty good and I think it looks decent! I don’t really like corset backs so I’m happy this one isn’t the same as the dress it’s nocking off. All in all… if you’re looking for a perfect dupe this isn’t it. If you’re looking for a beautiful dress that won’t break the bank, go  ahead and get this. (Also the sleeve, shawl thing is awful and way too loose. Could be tailored tho. Looks like a grandma shawl but I wasn’t planning to wear it anyways so I don’t care that much)",42
