Jessi Bee,Great for both the Renaissance Festival and as a maternity dres!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVBSB9NCNORJA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B078MXZMTL,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 12, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Beige,Verified Purchase,"First of all, I love this dress. It's comfortable, it's flattering, I think it would work as equally well for larger chested women than it did for my one A and one B-C cup (let's be realistic, women with drastically differently sized boobs, not everything does hide that).  After paying way too much for a corset at a local shop, I realized that I probably needed a dress to go under it. After hemming and hawing about what to go with and spending way too much comparing dresses, I finally convinced myself that this was the one I would go with because I thought all of the example photos of pregnant women in their maternity outftis were adorable, even though I wasn't pregnant myself anyways.  Well, turns out I was when I ordered it, even if I didn't get that little surprise result on a stick for another week.  Anyway, I do love a bargain so while I appreciated the compliments I got on my outfit at a Ren faire I went to, I'm also looking forward to using it again in a few months for a maternity shoot. Thanks, vision-dress!",

Dana D.,Pretty dresss & a review on 2 colors with sizing info.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR17UX5BPUS8I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B078MXZMTL,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 26, 2023",Size: SmallColor: Off-white,Verified Purchase,"Pretty dress, I've now ordered it in the off white and the light blue colors for Halloween costumes. It's diversity will give me the option to wear each of them with a bustier for steam punk or rennisance or a cowgirl with varsiois colors of busters, cowboy boots, hats and accessories I have.  I will say that the off white is a tad see thru and I will definitely need to wear at minimum nipple covers and perhaps nude boy shorts or spanx while the blue is a bit thicker and does not seem as transparent.  For sizing I do wish they had an extra small as it is a lot of fabric even in the small particularly on the top. For reference I am 5 ft 8 inches tall, 140-145lbs with a 32D bra size and wear between a 26/27 in jeans, a 4/6 in dresses but typically need to go up to a medium and sometimes large in shirts because of my chest size. The top is more than generous for larger chested women. The bottom is flowy but not overly so that I feel there is too much fabric. I do have a booty to fill it out though.",

It’s just that the elastic is flimsy. For example, My dog jumped on me and the blue dress fell apart and turned into a “tent” immediately and irreparably. Thankfully, I was home and I changed into the other dress, the red one, from this company. Well, that dress snagged on something as I was sitting down, so when I went to stand up…the dress was being tugged on and immediately fell apart. So, with my 3rd dress (the white one) from them, I am so so careful…I don’t even hug people out of fear that the dress will get snagged on their jewelry (or something).
