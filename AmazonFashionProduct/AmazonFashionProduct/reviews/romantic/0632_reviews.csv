Sizing can be difficult for me because I always have to size up with a bigger chest, but it looks too baggy everywhere else, but it wasn’t the case with this dress. For reference, I’m usually in between a L/XL, depending on the chest elasticity.  The girls were lifted, waist snatched, and the option of on or off the shoulder was really nice. I felt really beautiful in it. Last minute, I decided to return it to get a black dress.  The black dress came 2 days before the wedding and I was so upset that they sent the wrong size. I almost didn’t check since I knew how well the fit/look of it was. I ended up panic ordering for my actual size but with the time crunch, I didn’t even get to wear it and had to buy another dress in person. Really bummed about not only not being able to wear it for the wedding, but the fact that the order sizing was correct, the label on the bag was correct, but a different size was in it.  Because I didn’t even get the chance to wear it and of the mishap, I’ll have to give this a 2 star. But if everything panned out, I’d definitely give it a higher rating.",3

As with many of these cheaply mass produced items of clothing, the dress I got is not entirely symmetrical, more specifically, one half of the sweetheart neckline is higher up and uneven which makes it look cheap and somewhat off. I tried to even this out by ironing and steaming it gently, but it didn't help since the fabric seems to just have been cut unevenly and asymmetrically. Moreover, the material holds the wrinkles/folds from the packaging and there is a big, horizontal fold across the bust area which you can see in my picture as well as many pictures by other customers.",7
