I could've possibly made it work from the front but the back was a few inches too short in the waist and looked goofy...hit right under my bra line in the back. But if you're around the 5'4-5'5"" range or shorter this will be perfect. Accomodated a large bust as well. Would be great with black tights and black booties.",
