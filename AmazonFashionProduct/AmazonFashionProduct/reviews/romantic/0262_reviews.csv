The color, dark green is a stunner. I am 176 pounds 5 foot five and I ordered this dress in a large and then again in an XL and have just had a difficult time finding the right size for me. I would say that I initially sized up to an extra large because I wanted to make sure it was very bohemian long and flowy but the extra large was just way too big. So, if you’re in between sizes, maybe consider going down one size because this dress is long enough to size down and you’ll still have the length of a maxi. This is a heavy duty velvet dress, and it looks way more expensive than what it costs. I would definitely definitely recommend. But my advice is to purchase from a seller who allows you to do free returns because you may have a sizing issue and need to re-order to get the correct fit. I made the mistake of ordering a similar dress in a gold, crushed velvet from a DIFFERENT SELLER and the return has been impossible, so I am keeping the very extra large gold dress because I just can’t seem to handle the return. But THIS SELLER is very good and this green dress is worth every penny! You will love love love it. I think I will order it in more colors for different occasions. It would look great with boots, heals or flats. You could even add a sequin duster on top of it for even more glamour or add a sheer floral print duster for a casual look. Or just wear the dress as is, it is beautiful.",11
