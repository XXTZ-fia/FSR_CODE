Teresa R.

Also worth noting: I found it to fit small. I’m normally a medium, sized up to a large and it was still a bit slim through the hips for my liking.  PROS: very cute, flowy, and flattering. Lightweight and airy for summer. Great colors and patterns.  CONS: cheap feeling fabric, almost felt like wearing plastic to me? It was also very thin and looked like the fabric was already wearing through in some spots. I would definitely question how long it would hold up.",
