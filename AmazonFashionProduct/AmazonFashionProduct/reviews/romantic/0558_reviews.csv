Dreambo13,Stunning & Romantic Burgundy Dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KJVN8WHQVCPY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D59D9PQ5,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 15, 2024",Size: 10Color: Burgundy,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely loved this dress!! We used this dress as part of our Simple Romantic theme for Family Pictures. I love the dimension of the leg slit, ruffles of the top, light flowy material from the shoulders to the bottom of the dress, appearance of an empire waist, and the bold color. The shoulders are versatile so you can wear them on the shoulder or off-shoulder. I like that the design was made to look bunched in the bust which helped keep it secure and form fitting while leaning over. I felt the dress was flattering with the loose & flowy material with the texture up top to hide any unwanted flaws. The slit is a bit high so I wore neutral spanks in case the wind blew it open. Dress was soft and comfortable; wrinkles came out easily with a steamer. Make sure to wash separately as the color bled quite a bit in the washer, but the dress remained unfazed. It was durable enough for me to snag a heel on it a couple of times going up the stairs. I wish the price point was a little less expensive, but overall I loved this dress in our pictures!",

It's marketed as being adjustable, but the way they do this in practice is by making one of the shoulders VERY elasticized and the other not at all. The ""off the shoulder"" look is uh...dangerous on one side, and there's no way to get the two sleeves to match, and I have no idea how you'd wear this sleeveless or with both sleeves up and still have it look nice. On second glance the pictures do show the difference in the sleeves, but there's no good way to see it clearly. The rest of the fit was just as expected, the color and the materials are fine, but the sleeves are a puzzle I could not solve.",2

It’s very flattering, comfortable, and perfect for a formal dress. The dress stays up well and the fabrics feels nice. I am a bit of a perfectionist and went a little crazy with the ironing, but it was so worth it. If you don’t want to iron it, it will have some wrinkles but still looks beautiful. I was able to use a cheap handheld steamer to get the biggest wrinkles out but an iron worked best. I want a short dress in this style and more fabric options because I just love the cut and fit of it. I think it would also work well for bigger chests because I definitely had some room with a C/D cup. It stayed up and looked great both with a push up bra and braless even with me sizing up for a looser fit. I like that the arms are comfy and don’t dig in like some off the shoulder styles can. The colors look just like the picture and I got the light blue, light green, and black. I wore the light colors to weddings and was drinking and dancing a lot at both with no issues. I haven’t had the opportunity to wear the black one yet but I have a feeling it might be my favorite 😁",4
