The pockets add functionality, and the material is breathable and cool.  I wore this on a summer day to a birthday dinner and I felt comfortable throughout the party.  It was easy to move around in, even while chasing and carrying my toddler.  One thing I had to be careful with is getting the lace sleeves caught on things, so to preserve that part of the dress, I wouldn't wear it anywhere that requires a lot of movement.

I was so excited when it arrived. I love the style of this dress. The lace sleeves are nice for any time of year, yet perfect for the warmer months. I can have the longer sleeve I need for work with the coolness of a short sleeve. After taking it out of the packaging, I loved the vibrant burgundy. I was a bit worried when I held it up and noticed I could see the light from the window straight through the dress. I tried the dress on and loved the way it felt. The material is soft and comfortable. The two tier ruffles at the bottom are the ""in"" look right now and they do look adorable. The dress did seem a bit shorter than I had expected. It fell well above my knees. However, I am taller at 5'9 so the shortness of the dress should have been expected. I wore it to work a few days later and got many compliments on the color and style. However, as I had feared, one of my co-workers remarked about how thin the dress looked and she could see through the bottom ruffle. She could see my legs under the dress. Half way through the day I was delighted to realize that this dress has pockets. I must not have read the description of the item completely or maybe I skimmed over it because I did not remember that was a feature of the dress. Dresses with pockets are not common so if you want one with that unexpected feature, this dress may be for you. I wanted to be in love with this dress. It does have very positive points as well as draw backs. The comfort of the material and the style were a hit with me but I could not get past the uncomfortable thought that people were staring through the bottom ruffle at my legs all day and it was a little too short for my liking. I think I will wear it again with leggings under it to fix my uncomfortable feeling of both it being too short and the semi see through aspect of it. But, I did want it to be a dress and not a long top, so that makes me a bit sad.",

This stress checks all the boxes because it is flowing, comfortable, the fabric is of great quality. I live in an area where is warm all year around but we pretty much live in AC so this dress is perfect because it’s great for both outdoors and  indoors. The sleeves are light and not itchy at all, and you can bring them up or keep them down and the elastic is not going to be very tight.",2

I have a larger bust and there’s plenty of space. It doesn’t bell out quite like I’d hoped for, but it does an ok job of hiding my tummy.  I would say it kind of straddles the line between casual and dressy. It’s mostly casual - works for lunches, daily wear, nights out, etc. Because if the sleeves, it can almost be passed off as dressy… perhaps even more so if you layer in the right accessories.  I am happy with it though. It looks nice and I feel good wearing it.",

But it was VERY loose. I had planned on putting a belt around the middle to give it shape until I noticed you could see my unders. 🤣  Very cute. Very flattering. Runs big. Entirely see through.,2

A month or two ago I got a dress just like this one, in black, and now I have one in burgundy.  Being a mere 5' tall, this comes to mid-calf on me, and it is about as comfortable as a dress can get, yet it looks terrific.  I  did not want to wind up wearing a caftan or mu-mu, and this is perfect for me.  It is loose fitting yet somehow shows enough curves to make me feel pretty, especially with the lace sleeves.  On top of all that, it has pockets(!!!!) and launders beautifully.  So now i have two of these dresses, and I am feeling very comfortable and happy...and by the way, this dress/tunic works well with cover-ups, should you want to add some warmth to fight the overly active AC.",4

The seams are well-finished and the neck line has a double seam. The gathering on the waist is even and it drapes nicely. It might require a slip.  The lace on the sleeves has just a bit of stretch to it, so that it is soft and less-likely to tear if snagged. Because the waist looked high to me, I was skeptical that it could be belted, but the seam is low enough to belt which totally changes the look of the dress. Nice.",

I love the beautiful wine color and will post updates if it fades after washing. Again, no tag, so I assume it is hand washed. Super flattering and hid my wobbly bits. Great with a nice wedge, some boho jewelry and a cowboy hat. Also, can be dressed up up or down from work to happy hour and dancing. This dress definitely has some ‘twirl’ in it!

When I put a belt with it, if I keep it in line with the ruffle lines on the dress, it hits just under my breasts so it creates more of an empire waist.  I'm long in the torso, so for someone who doesn't have this problem, it probably looks better.",

Only the top front of the dress has a double layer of fabric. So you do need to wear an under slip so the bottom is not so revealing, because the light will show thru the bottom of the dress. The sleeves are made of really pretty thick lace. They are flowy but have a slightly ruff and itchy texture, that is why one star was taken off. But fortunately they don't bother wife much.

I gained a lot of weight taking it. So it’s been difficult to try to order the correct size that I feel that I need. Since it did say this is a loose fitting dress, I would really order a size down. The dresses I’ve been buying and reviewing have mostly been larges. I’m 5’2, 150 lbs and my bra size is a 36C. I hope this review kinda helps! Like I said it’s an adorable dress, I do love the sleeves…also the fabric is thin. You can look through it, and see. I held it up and I could look outside my bathroom window.
