Whovian,Runs small & slip part runs very short,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29RN4WXIV07AA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09F3DBN8K,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 22, 2023",,,"Fit: Definitely runs small. I sized up a size and am thankful I did, otherwise it wouldn't have fit. If you're chesty, even a size up may be snug in that area. The slip part underneath is way short, barely covers what it should, and would definitely not be acceptable if I were to bend over, even with the lacey overlay. (I'd add that although I'm plus size with decent hips, most plus size bottoms in my size for waists are too big in the bottom/bum and legs, almost always sagging.) I'll be using this dress for a family holiday card portrait taken at home, so I can get around the short aspect, but if that wasn't the case, I would definitely have to pair this with shorts or leggings of some sort (which definitely takes away from the dressy look one would probably be trying to achieve with this dress).  Look: There are darts sewn on the chest area that look a little too defined when on and when off. A specific bra may be required to help smooth this odd look out, depending on your chest shape and size.  Color: I bought the champagne colored dress, in the v-neck. In person it is darker than a champagne color and is more closer to a camel color. Definitely on the beige spectrum, but certainly not as light as the color champagne typically is. It'll work, color-wise, for my needs, but it won't be close to the color I was hoping for.  Quality: Overall it is okay as far as quality goes. Zipper is better than you might think. My qualm with the quality is that it was already showing picks in the lacey overlay before I unzipped its bag. So I will need to snip and smooth the fabric before wearing, and be extra careful as it is apparent that it will snag/pick extremely easily.  Overall: Would I buy it again? No. Am I pleased with it? Also no. Will I make do with it? Yes, unfortunately. Would I recommend this dress to others? No. And especially not to thick, tall, and/or chesty people.",

I ordered a large. The dress went all the way to the floor in the back, but with a 1 and 1/2 inch heel, that was fixed. My only issue was that the front cup area (under lace) was slightly irregular. No one seemed to notice, but it bothered me. If have broad shoulders, you may need someone to help you zip it up and unzip it. Also, don't order it if your stomach pokes out. Zipping will be too challenging because it gets tight in the abdomen area. My stomach is very flat and my weight comes in from my hips. So, A-line dresses work for me. Other than that, I'd recommend buying it. I got lots of compliments.",12
