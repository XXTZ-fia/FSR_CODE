The color is vibrant and exactly as shown in the pictures, making it perfect for any occasion. The fabric is soft and lightweight, yet feels durable and high-quality. It’s super comfortable to wear and flows beautifully, adding a touch of elegance.  The fit is true to size and very flattering, enhancing my shape without being too tight. I received so many compliments when I wore it! It’s versatile enough to dress up with heels for a formal event or pair with flats for a more casual outing.  Highly recommend this dress if you’re looking for style, comfort, and quality in one!",
Kjerstine King,A very lovely dress!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PCTL55WPHBSU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2D64FG8,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 24, 2024",Size: 3X-LargeColor: Black,,"This dress is just beautiful in it's simplicity. I love the design and cut. Its very flattering to all body types (in my opinion). Its made well, and the fabric is pretty decent. The only issue I have with the dress is the smallness of the armholes. They are really small despite the option of extra large sizing. This makes the wear a bit uncomfortable, unfortunately. But everything else about this dress is just lovely!",

The material is fairly thick. My favorite color is dark blue and I ordered the dress in navy. This is one of those dresses that can be easily mistaken for black -- it's not as blue as the navy dress in the product images. So, if you want a blue dress, you should go with the royal blue color.",

It fits true to size, has some ""give"" for moving and to be comfortable, and is very flattering in its shape.  It's fitting on the top, and below the waist is nice and flowing, which also helps hide any problem areas.  The cap sleeves are elegant and this can easily be worn to a wedding or other event.  I love it!",
Late Adopter,"Beautiful and flowy, heavier fabric with a little stretch",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R307F59TI3Y2OB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2D64FG8,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 26, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Burgundy,,"I ordered this dress in my usual size medium, in the burgundy color. I am 5’4” and about 155lbs. This dress is pretty amazing. The styling is a timeless basic and it is the sort of dress you can keep at the ready for just about any occasion – dinners out, the office, weddings, graduations, church, you name it. You’ll need a second set of hands to zip it up the back, but it lays beautifully through the bodice to the hips. The fabric has just enough give where I think it would work if I was up 5 or down 5 lbs. I have a sway back, and this hugs and skims in the back over my curves and is very feminine and flattering. If you have a larger chest, you may want to consider sizing up, but I’m a little larger on the bottom than the top. The front flowy layers are still practical, so you don’t need to worry about a wind coming along and showing too much on accident. I would consider ordering this in more colors, if I could justify it! And the price is very affordable for something you can wear again and again. You can accessorize many different ways to change things up, or layer with the right light sweater or scarf. Great dress!",4
Anne B,Simple and nice,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27KRLE237Y8GD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2D64FG8,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 17, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Burgundy,,I bought this dress for my niece and it fits her really well and she absolutely loves it.  The style is nice and simple while the material leans more to a light medium weight.  She felt comfortable wearing it but she stated she wouldn't wear this to as a prom dress and I agree 💯.,

Calling it a Prom Dress is a bit much. I got the Navy color, and it is very dark blue, darker than the picture suggests. The size was right and fit as expected. The zipper works, but need help with it because of how high up it goes.",
