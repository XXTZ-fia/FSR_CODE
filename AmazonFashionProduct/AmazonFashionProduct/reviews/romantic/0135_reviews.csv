And I’ve gone through surgeries and always recovering.  We had a road trip. And I had to find something comfortable and fitting. I ordered several things. This was my favorite.

This fit amazingly and covered everything on top. It was SO comfortable. The green was darker than I anticipated but the fit made up for that. I want them in every color now.

I also had a cross body on the day that I wore it and it wore off the dye on the fabric in the back, so there is a diagonal line across the back of the dress. it makes me sad because the dress is just so flattering.

Looks just like the pic and fits perfectly. I'm a 42DD, so I wear a yellow cami since it shows a lot of cleavage due to my bust size, which is common with this style. I'm 4'10"", so it's midi length on me, which is fine. It's not pleated, so it lays nicely; when you're curvy, pleats make you look much bigger, so it's a perfect style since it also comes in at the waist.  I originally loved this dress because of the fit and comfort, but I had to take 2 stars off for three poor quality. Maybe if it was only $10 I wouldn't be upset, but for $30+, it should not pill or fade so easily. It pilled with the first wear and faded with the first wash even though I washed it inside out in cold water and line dried it. Maybe the light colors won't look as worn out as quickly.",
avalancheryder,Edited: Daughter thought navy floral dress was from Anthropologie but solid black is not as pictured,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EWBZP1UNBN6B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D49BGD3X,"3.0 "," the United States "," July 6, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Blue/White,Verified Purchase,"… that says a lot! my daughter is very much opposed to fast fashion, so I was pleasantly surprised when she thought the large dark blue flowers on white print of this dress was Anthropologie. I was a bit skeptical of the polyester/spandex blend, but it feels pretty nice and soft. I need this for an upcoming business trip and when I ordered, the small — which is my recommended size — wasn’t going to arrive in time., but the medium was available for next day delivery. The waist of the medium firs well but the bust and armholes are a little big. Fortunately, I checked again and ordered the small since now it’s saying it will arrive in time for my trip  Update: I also bought this in solid black and it’s not as pictured so adjusting from 5 to 3 stars. The picture shows that the pockets on the solid black dress are sewn on the side seams and essentially invisible unless you put your hands in them like the model. The solid black dress I received had the pockets sewn off the seams which gave the dress a more casual feel and I didn’t like that, so solid black is going back",
