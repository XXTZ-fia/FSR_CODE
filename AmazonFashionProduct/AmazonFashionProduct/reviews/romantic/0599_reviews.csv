It has the same problem that all form fitting dresses have and rides up as you walk because of the smooth velvety fabric. The way it fit me (I am 5'0) it was a little longer than what is shown on the model, but would ride up so the extra length was appreciated.  For the price it's decent, but don't expect a prefect dress with flawless seams and perfectly sew on lace. The straps are adjustable and the charm has stayed on even through the wash (on delicate cycle). I hung dry it and it's doing fine.",

I’m 5’5 and around I think 270 pounds. I had a kid so I definitely have a bit of a tummy but this dress is very complimenting! It has nice stretch to it so I don’t feel constricted or uncomfortable. The trim obviously isn’t stretchy but it doesn’t dig into my skin when I walk. I’d say it’s fine for someone who is considered plus size WITH A SMALLER CHEST. I’m happy with it. It also came.. 3 days early,

It’s definitely really short and I wore shorts underneath because of that. I also have a larger chest but I managed to make everything look nice. The one thing I am concerned about (but not enough to reduce stars yet) is the straps. Because I have a bigger chest I always felt like straps were pretty flimsy or like about to snap, but they held up dancing all night for what I needed it for. It’s probably not a dress I am planning on wearing again either just because of the style but either way very cute",37
