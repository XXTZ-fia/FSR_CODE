Christopher Ellis,"As described, but is a LINT MAGNET",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VSX64YKTCSO1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08X6TBWMC,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 28, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Burgundy,Verified Purchase,"My Reference: 167cm/5'6"", 135 lb, with long torso, bust 34in, waist 28in, hip 37in.  The dress is as described. Velvet Burgundy looks like the photo with pleats on the tummy. Size suggested S/M, so I got the M bc I was in-between, and wasn't sure how stretchy it was. Well, it was too loose on me. If you're closer to 141-145lb, get the Medium. But if you're like my build, get the Small. I also tried it on with 2.25in heels, and the hem was a smidge on the floor. I knew this would happen after measuring my hollow to the floor, which is 55in. The dress is 57.5in. It's also supposed to be form fitting/stretchy, and the slit is a nice touch. They have the frog button on the side in case you want to adjust the slit length. I emailed them for it just in case, but didn't need it bc it was low enough to me.  But bc it was also loose on me, and touching the floor, it was a lint/hair MAGNET! I have carpet, so it was inevitable. For that, I couldn't see myself having to lint roll constantly. Honestly, as I was was trying to lint roll the dress to return, just it being near any lint attracted to it so easily. So if you hate that, don't get this dress. (Sorry in advance if anyone gets my dress and it has a little bit of lint. I tried getting it all out before returning. )  It's light weight, came in a resealable bag, and had prime shipping, which is a huge plus for delivery and returns. I was scared reading other stories about not being actually free returns. So this made it feel convenient in case it didn't fit.  Overall, don't recommend if you hate lint magnets, but recommend for chilly events. The price is reasonable for what it is.",4

I think if I were going for a more provocative, Jessica Rabbit style, the small would have been perfect, but the medium also fits well and looks classic and elegant. If you are between sizes like I am, go with your normal size for the sexy club look, and go with the size up for the sexy elegant look. The dress is very flattering, very forgiving. It hugs the bottom just a little even with sizing up, and I'm fairly evenly proportioned. The dress looks like it will not wrinkle easily and is washable. I'm in love. I might walk around my house wearing it like Monica and Phoebe and Rachel did with their wedding dresses on Friends. Haha!",6

I vacuum my house daily but it seems to pick up lint from my carpet and anything it came in contact with. It was literally like a magnet.  When I put the dress on it reminded me of something an older lady might wear to a formal event. I’m in my late 30s and just felt like I was wearing my moms dress. Which is strange because it looks cute in many of the review pictures.  The stomach rouching was really odd too and the seams seemed to want to shift as I wrote it marking the dress feel twisted.  This one will be going back.  I will say that the fitness pretty accurate with regard to sizing,3

The slit is a bit high for me but they did provide a Chinese frog button to sew on to close it up a bit more and also add an extra elegant detail. I got an XL but felt like I could have sized down to a Large. A lot of reviews said the tummy area was a bit awkward but I am 6 months pregnant and it fit extremely well around the belly area but I’m not quite sure if it would look as good not pregnant, there may be a little too much material in that area.

I had read some reviews before purchasing and decided to wear it slightly off shoulder. Wearing it off-shoulder, I was constantly adjusting the shoulders because it would go back to v-neckline while dancing/movement. Off shoulder wear also caused the zipper to bunch in the back so I would have to pull the dress down a lot to prevent that from happening. I imagine if I would have worn it as normal it wouldn’t have done that. But overall, I love the off shoulder look in this dress and will wear it like that again hands down.
