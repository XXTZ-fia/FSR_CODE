Just a tiny bit tight.  I’m a 36A .  It’s definitely lightweight. Feels like when spring first arrives and you want to wear something like this that’s flowy and comfortable.  I know I’m a weirdo. 😆 it’s very nice but for me it was too big on the lower part. Definitely if you are less then 36ish this will fit perfectly even for someone pear shaped.  I’m 38 on my hips and it had way too much room. Like 2 times my hip size.  just don’t dry it. Oh and the shoulder part other than the arm area was a little loose. My shoulders are a tiny bit over 15 wide. I’m 5’2 and the small was touching my ankles.UPDATE: definitely not comfortable wearing it to bed.  Guess it’s just to be elegant and take off before bed.,7

The 2x is pretty big but that’s good just in case I get pregnant or bigger so I like the extra room! I took a star off because at this price it should not be see through period. I don’t understand why it is. I was going to buy more in different colors but this has made me rethink that. I am purchasing the overcoat but again, in the summer months when I garden or get the mail or packages at my front door I don’t necessarily want to wear the overcoat on top of the dress because in the summer it gets hot. For the price this dress shouldn’t show my underwear! It does get a little hot in the summer with this but it’s manageable. Overall the print and cut is nice. It is very elegant but wear a slip or a housecoat when going outside or you’re neighbors will see ur undies!  * Took another star off because when I washed and line dried it it shrunk in the sleeve area.",15

When I opened the bag the smell was overwhelming.  It smells like bug spray or something. I washed it. It still smelled. I washed it a second time. It isn’t as strong but the smell remains. I tried it on. The ribbon sticks out all over not flat as it should be. The gown is made of several panels instead of the usual front and back only. It is huge!!!  It hangs off me.  I am very disappointed and I’m sure I can’t return it because I’ve washed it. I wasn’t going to try it on with whatever was making it smell so horrid. It was a waste of nearly $50. I would not recommend or ever but this brand again.,3
