The flutter sleeve is such a fun detail. I also love the flowy-ness of the dress. It's comfortable and can be worn casually with sneakers or dressed up with the right sandals for a more elevated look. I took one star off of my rating because the pictures make it seem like it’s made of a natural gauzy material, which is not the case. It’s definitely a synthetic poly material.",

The color is deeply saturated. This is a very feminine and flirty dress. The flounce sleeveless sleeves are perfect. You can wear the sleeves on your shoulders or pulled down. I love the pockets. I fixed the issue of it being to large with a simple blazer clip. The clips that you add to the back of a blazer to cinch it in when it’s too large.

I am 5’6.5” 108 pounds 34”x26”x36” broad shoulders, long legs & ’m a very full B cup (used to be a C) Hoping this helps others.",
C.C.,Best belted if you’re busty,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S2SFHXZMCXZW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CS6PF3SL,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 23, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Orange,,"I chose this adorable orange dress for my spring wardrobe, specifically with Easter in mind. The fresh light orange was a unique shade that i thought would transition well between seasons. The tiered dress and flutter sleeves are typically a flattering silhouette for my shape, and the smocked neckline makes this a versatile dress that can also be worn off shoulder (one of my favorite styles). The dress is just as gorgeous in person as in the listing, the color is accurately depicted while the fabric is both breathable and comfortable. However, the dress didn't seem to lay naturally across my larger bust. It would cause awkward creasing at the top of the garment and then tent out below my bust, giving it a slightly frumpy look and also an unflattering silhouette for my body type (as shown in pictures). By belting it below my bust, it smoothed it out and showcased my figure better- transforming it into a dress i feel super confident and comfortable in. If you’re small to average chested, i feel like the dress would lay nicely on your figure and a belt wouldn’t be necessary for this to be a showstopping dress. However, if you’re built more like me (40 DD and size 12/14), i would suggest finding a cute thin belt to pair it with. The dress quality is great, and its seams/fabric help to keep the belt secure without belt loops. It’s definitely worth it to accessorize and I would recommend this feminine flutter-sleeve dress for any special event- or even pair it with casual sneakers and a hat for a warm day. I’m so pleased with this timeless beauty and can’t wait to showcase it this Spring. 🧡",7

Hogg Wyld,A Great Choice for Warm Weather Dressy Casual!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DAZ6R9F59L4G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CS6PF3SL,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 22, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Green,,"This dress is really great for vacation or warm weather occasions!  I really like its vibrant green color with ruffle sleeves and flowing skirt.  The smocked top has a lot of elasticity, so my 47"" bust was fine fitting in the XL (shown as 41.73"" on the size chart).  The fit was accurate for the waist and there is a room for movement if you are a little past the maximum measurement.  It does fit closer to the body rather than the exaggerated version shown on the seller's page.  This dress also has pockets, but I wish it didn't...I like ""cleaner lines,"" especially as I don't put things in pockets. That's my only constructive criticism.  The fabric is lightweight and airy, feels pleasant against the skin, and isn't see through (especially given the lining); the material's texture adds a nice design touch.",

Unfortunately, the dress didn’t fit me well, even though I ordered my usual size, small. The style on the top seems to be designed for someone very thin and flat. If you don’t fit this specific body type, it might not work for you. However, on a positive note, I absolutely loved the sky blue color and the material felt nice to the touch. It’s a shame that the fit wasn’t right for me.”",

Nope. While this looks exactly like the photo in style, color, & length the fit/sizing is not right. It fit like a tight bodycon mermaid dress making me think even someone who is a medium or small might consider doubling up to get that breezy look instead of a fit & flare. It fit around my wider than average shoulders and C sized bust. The seams have ZERO give so after getting the stretch part over my chest, I had to shimmy the rest down only to realize I then couldn't really move or walk. I like the breathable crepe material, the fluffy sleeve, and love the blue green color but I'd need at least a 3XL to look as effortless as the model. But she does have pockets!",
