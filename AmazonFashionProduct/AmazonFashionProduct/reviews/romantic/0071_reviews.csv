I feel like the dress ran a little small. Maybe if you have larger chest, the dress is not for you. So I had to order a larger size than usual. Then the dress was quite unattractive on & too big! But the kimono fit great after going up a size. So I wear it over another dress!",

Though I lost a few pounds prior to getting it, when I put a sash like belt around the waist, it doesn't look so big on me. It feels comfy. The colors and patterns go together well. Next time I will get a smaller size because I didn't realize I was down a size already...lol.",2
