While it doesn't have pockets, it is my favorite address to wear and my clients and models use them frequently from my client closet. They're so cute and also look good with a corset over the top (I have a photo of myself wearing the sage screen one with a corset but I have no idea where that photo is!).

Regan E Walsh,Really Cute and Nursing Friendly!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D00HWY0SCXQ5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XH18HSF,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 10, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Armygreen-1,Verified Purchase,"I am 5'3 and 110lbs and ordered a size S. It fits exactly as expected and is VERY comfortable! The fabric is definitely on the thin side but it washes well and most of the wrinkles fall out when I hang it up to dry.  My favorite thing about this dress is that it's nursing friendly!!! I don't like most dresses that are intended for nursing because they have weird hidden pockets or loose layers of fabric and they end up looking frumpy and wrinkled. I love this one because it's not intended for nursing but can easily accommodate it. The top elastic is super stretchy! I didn't have it during my pregnancy but it seems like it could be worn before, during and after pregnancy as well.",

I think if the dress didn’t have the extra layer of fabric on the very top (near breast and all along back) I’d like it better. Also if there was a slit or something. It’s just too much material and it doesn’t lay flat since the material is a bit thicker.",4
