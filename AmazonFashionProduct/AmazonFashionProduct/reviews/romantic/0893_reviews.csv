It’s super cute, you can adjust the straps with a string and it zips at the sides in addition to lacing up the corset back. The only thing I don’t love is the bottom part of the top is a little floppy because there isn’t a boning inside of it, so it kind of curls up a bit. But I still love the top!",

They then send me a notice it won't be here till after my event! Ugh! Now as soon as it comes, I have to return it again! This has been an annoying experience. Product itself seemed great quality.
