DA,It worked!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PMRCYZ380M9Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8NBQPPR,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Gold,Verified Purchase,I had to go to a dress up function and didn’t want to spend much. This worked. I liked the dress more than the cover up and ended up changing out for a shawl I had. That said good buy for the money!,
Tricia B.,Don’t fall for the pictures,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ENH9RR7W57Z4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8NBQPPR,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black Gold,Verified Purchase,This is shaped like a bag. Meaning no shape. If they had gone for a roaring 20’s flapper dress it might have worked. But the product images show shaping in the waist and under chest areas.  The quality of construction and material is not in the realm of what was paid for it. $75? More like $30. Sequins were falling off left and right during my brief trying-on. I feel scammed frankly.,
Terri Lira,The gold color of sequins is more like a rose gold,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXVJU0G0UJO9X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8NBQPPR,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2025",Size: XX-LargeColor: Gold,Verified Purchase,Loved the fit of the dress and the style. But on the sleeves there were some sequins missing and thread pulls. Also the dress had a small stain on it! Almost like it had been worn. I had to go ahead and wear it as I didn't have enough time to find another dress. But I won't be wearing it again. Very disappointed with the quality.,
PJ,Gold color Dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2U3Q4BHG2TTOR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8NBQPPR,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Gold,Verified Purchase,The wrong color was sent.

It had just the right amount of sparkle and the option of the light cover was spot on.  Sadly, I had to return it as the gold was more of a champagne gold, not the more metallic bright gold I needed (specified for a themed party).  Still wanted to keep it, but I don't think I would have any occasion to wear it.  I would definitely recommend if you are looking for this type of dress.",
Stacey Kearney,Not wrinkled!!!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VTMT34YW6T2K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8NBQPPR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Rose Gold,Verified Purchase,This dress is absolutely gorgeous.

I got the rose gold which actually looks peachy. I am 5'3 and 122 pounds. Ordered medium. Never thought I would by a dress from Amazon especially as a mother of the bride. Love it,

This was an amazing value and I felt great when I wore it. The jacket is just ok but still nice (you can substitute a shawl or just wear the dress). The sequins did not fall off. True to size (medium) and very flattering. I bought a top from the same manufacturer and was equally pleased. In total, less the $100 for both!",

On the last day ṭo order and receive before the big day, I chose this dress.  It fit perfect, it forms to your body comfortably and smooths fatty areas (Lol). I was very nervous and felt out of place ( this is only the 2 dress worn in my adult life). I arrived at the venue and several of the other guests complimented on how beautiful the dress is. Even though I'll probably never wear it again, it will hang in my closet forever. Material is stretchy and lightweight.",

PS,Cheap fabric and make,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I962BQZPKTB1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8NBQPPR,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 24, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Wine Red,Verified Purchase,I ordered the dress for a Christmas party and didn't understand why the fabric had a bad fall. The back of the dress was slightly lifted up looking odd from behind. A closer look shows how the making has been careless. They did not even straighten the fabric before using a machine to stitch the sequin lines on it. In more than one place the sequin lines run over pinched fabric. Straightening it is out of question.,

Good quality w/zipper in the back. The second piece that I’ll call the jacket for lack of a better word, gets easily wrinkled. So it gives an overall frumpy look especially in front where it needs to be more slick in order to keep the tapered look desired. The material just tends to flop around the chest area w/out any real form. Other than that. It’s a good 4 stars",4
