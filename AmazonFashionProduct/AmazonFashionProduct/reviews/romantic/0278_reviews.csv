The photo gives the impression of princess seaming, nope its cut like a box. Overall its a shapeless mess, that should have cost $15, not over $50. Also there is this odd string tie thing,that I just dont get. Im debating do I pull out the sewing machine and fix this , or return it. Its winter and I dont really feel like driving to UPS, but as I am writing this review, I will suck it up and return. For this amount of money I should not need to rip it apart and re sew it into something else",

As for sizing, I have to say that first of all it is smaller than standard, so order at least one size bigger (I would recommend 2). When you do get it, I hope you are comfortable that it is a thin, Halloween costume feeling that is not flattering unless you airbrush your pictures of yourself.  For $20 it would be worth using it as a last minute costume, but for $60 this is nothing. If you want a corset you will need to spend at least twice this much and go to a real corset shop.",
