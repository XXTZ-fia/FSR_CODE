I could barely get it on, and there was a huge white faded spot on the front of the dress. It was way too small, so I returned it and eventually ordered the next size up. The Large just arrived today, and i was super excited to try it on. This time the top was too big, the shoulders wanted to slid off, and the neckline was severely droopy. And again there was a faded white patch on the front of the dress, tho not as much as the first time. So i will be returning it again, and not buying another. The colors were great, as was the style and texture, I just wish the fit would work for me. My sister also bought this same dress before i did, and had a major drooping problem with the neck. She kept hers a week, and washed it, bit it didn't improve.",
