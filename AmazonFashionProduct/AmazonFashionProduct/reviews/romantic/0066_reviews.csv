Isabelle,"Absolutely gorgeous, slightly awkward fit",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39EQ1CKQ01YK1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJVGMD43,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 23, 2024",Size: Large-X-LargeColor: Green,Verified Purchase,"Such a beautiful and comfortable dress, possibly the prettiest I've ever owned! This one does have more of a smell than the other pieces I ordered from this brand, but it is made with Rayon so that is expected due to the manufacturing processes and will dissipate with time.  The issue with this dress is the arm holes- they gap at the sides which gives the illusion of it being too large. In reality, this is just because the straps are too long, and I will be fixing it by shortening them- I took a picture holding them up to be shorter so you can kind of see how it helps to pull the excess fabric in under your arms.  It's a bit longer on me than the photos looked, so bear that in mind as I am not short- I'm 5'6, and the shortest point of the hem reaches just below the knee on me. However it is a good length on me and has lovely glow and movement so I don't mind!  This dress is really comfy and is made of a thin, soft T-shirt type material. It seems breathable enough for summer but not too thin for cooler months. It's very versatile and I can see myself dressing it up for evenings as well as wearing it casually as a daytime sundress!!",
Victoria,Gorgeous!!!

I usually am a size 16/18 and I’m 5’4”. I got this in a 1x/2x and it fits great! Make sure to wash before you wear because the dye will rub off. Also, be careful with the dress and make sure to hand wash because my dress tore at the bottom because I didn’t follow directions. Easy enough to fix though! I will definitely buy more from this store.",

Tie straps aren’t too short or too long. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because: Bra straps don’t show on the shoulder (which is great) but it is a little too low cut on the back and shows bra back strap so I had to take it up a little - but it’s a really easy fix with some safety pins or a quick sew job so I don’t need a tailor to do it.",

The 1x/2x fits more like a 2x, which was good because I usually fit a 2x or 3x and wasn't sure which to get. If you have a very large chest or a wide waist, consider sizing up. The back of the bodice is stretchy so there is some room for larger chests but the waist is not stretchy at all so if you're in an ""apple shaped"" body there may be some discomfort when you sit, bend, etc. The uneven hem is so pretty! The shortest part was about mid thigh on me, and parts of the fabric are sheer, so a taller person may find they need shorts or tights underneath for full coverage. The color is amazing and I love the shiny thread throughout the embroidery on the front. Very pleased that it's just metallic thread so I don't have to worry about tiny beads falling off. This dress is going to make it's debut as part of a fairy costume for an event, but I'm definitely going to wear it again and again!",

It says hand wash. Now this particular dress hasn’t been washed yet. At all. And my hands are blue from handling it. I’m frustrated because I didn’t plan to wash it before I wear it, as I’d hoped it would help retain its vibrancy. In the past once washed, the dresses became dull. And I was hoping to avoid that this time. The purple one I ordered came damaged. As many have said, different parts of the stitching and designs had come unraveled. Even before it was opened! I did get a refund for that one though. The dresses are beautiful. And if you are handy and can fix minor damages, they are a steal. Just know, the quality is low, and you get what you pay for.",3
