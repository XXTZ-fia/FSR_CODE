It is a unique way to tell the one you love how much you love them. It glows in the dark and I like how small it is. Perfect gift for your child or boyfriend/girlfriend. It comes in a nice little box with a tiny card to write on. This is a very popular expression of love and I say it to my son quite often. It is a really sweet token of love to remind someone just how much you love them!,

Katie,TINY but cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FQ901UNFUPTS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B5412SCH,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2022",Color: Glow Moon Tiny Message in a Bottle with Black Gift Box,,"It takes a little bit to scroll down and really see the size of this in their description.  When they describe it as TINY, they aren't lying.  My pictures are it in my hand to show you the true size.  I also cannot get the confetti to stay around the bottle (like their pictures), so really you just have glow in the dark confetti on the bottom and maybe a little bit around the edge.  I don't like shaking it (like the directions) because I'm afraid the astronaut will break.  I will say the astronaut/moon/sign seem to be high quality and I don't see it easily breaking as it does come in a giftable box as they describe.For the price and the glitter not really looking like advertised, I took off one star because I don't think the value is there.However, the reason I bought this is because this is what my son and mom say to each other every time they talk so the meaning is very special...also because it is so small, it is something she could put anywhere to remind her of her grandson.  If that is what you are looking for, then this is perfect but I just can't get over the price of something this small.",2

Jared,It's cute,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SAK2ABMO7XLY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B5412SCH,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 10, 2022",,,"It's a cute gift idea if you know someone who likes bees. I don't know if I'd call the ""card"" an actual card... It's more like a tag that you can write a message on. The box it comes in is decent and would work well enough for gifting. I think the idea is to put some ribbon around it and then tie it to the tag.  As far as the item itself, it's pretty much as described. The eyes weren't straight but it gives it character. I feel this item is a bit overpriced for what you get, but it is a unique gift idea and doesn't take up much space for the minimalists in our lives so I'd say it's a good product overall.",
