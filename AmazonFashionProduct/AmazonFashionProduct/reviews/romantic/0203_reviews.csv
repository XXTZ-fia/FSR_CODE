KristenMyers*TanTaxi,They need to change the fabric of the dresses.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R389YX0WVQH4T2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZJ32GVM,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 16, 2024",Fit Type: Sleeveless-FloralSize: XX-LargeColor: Z_floral 24,,In the first two photos I am wearing the ones I purchased on Amazon they should fit more like my dress in the 3 Rd photo . But they don't because the dresses from Amazon have 4 % spandex in them which weighs the dress down and shows my flaws too much. If they made this dress with 100% polyester fabric the fit would be much better. I don't like to see my back rolls or lover handles and the dress with spandex shows all that I hate about myself . The 3 dress I purchased with stripes I bought from a site called daily deals . The makers of this dress should alter the way they are manufacturing this dress and only use 100% polyester in it . Also the spandex in the dress make it heavy in the chest area and that is why they have to add a stupid button to the dress . I don't like button but if you don't use the button the dress material falls down to easily and shows your bra or your nipple if you don't have a bra on under the dress. But if you notice my dress made of all polyester  doesn't need a snap. Bc it sits perfect over my breast area.  I'm trying to improve your design please make the change to $100 % polyester,
