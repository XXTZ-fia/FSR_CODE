Annie Ponce,Bizarre Dress,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XXEGQY3EM8ZN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9Z73YLL,"1.0 "," the United States "," February 21, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I wanted to like this dress so much, but the fit was so weird on it. It was tight in the shoulders and arms, yet loose in the torso. When I tied up the neck, it felt like the dress was going to choke me. Also, the length was not good, but that may have been a personal qualm. All in all, it gets a 2 because there was so much going on with it.",2

For the prices charged, they should be ashamed. The white part of the dress was so incredibly dingy and not white at all. Terrible buy. Wouldn’t recommend.",2
