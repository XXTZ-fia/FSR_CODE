The sleeves on the solid color shirts are not sheer material as they are on the floral/patterned shirts.  Although the solid color shirts may be too warm in the sun and very warm weather, I like those shirts better and will enjoy them on cool days and all winter long.  I had expected to like the patterns better, but did not.  The apricot color is more pink than I expected.  They are synthetic, and the wrinkles did not wash out. However, all of the shirts pressed easily on a low setting with steam; I haven't worn or washed them since. Finally, the floral/print shirts have a white lining, so they are not see through; the solid colors don't have a liner or need one. I like the neckline and the length.",7
