Katie B.,Not a flattering dress on me,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DO596M1GMIBL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09LZ2DF5X,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Floral Green,,I love the pattern of this dress and it looks just like pictures. It’s bright and fun. The fabric is lightweight and would be perfect to throw on in the summer and go. I don’t think this dress cut is flattering. I still have a belly after having my fourth kiddo and this dress accentuates that. The top also isn’t flattering in the chest area or around the collar. I have a long torso and short legs so the elastic band also hits in a weird spot.,

Its well made, doesnt seem to shrink in the dryer,and has a nice flowy skirt. The body of the dress is a little short, so if you have a long torso the waistband would probably be a little to high, and there is a large gap for the sleeves, so your armpits will show. Overall, great dress,  but check your measurements to make sure you get a good size for you.",5
