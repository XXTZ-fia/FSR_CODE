The spaghetti straps fall at a weird spot too making them uncomfortable on your shoulders and causing them to fall off easily. I’m a 36DD so maybe this would fit better on a smaller chest (although I can’t imagine the seam fitting right on anyone with nipples).  I’m 5’1” and the length was surprisingly perfect for me.  Super sad because the print and colors are gorgeous. Material is thin in a good way and doesn’t seem to be see through (although I only tried it on inside). I was so excited about this dress so I’m super bummed about the awkward design and fit.",4

The spacing/area for your breasts isn’t very big and the design includes distinct stitching under the breasts that makes it an awkward fit.

Mom to Many,"Fashion Forward and Flattering, runs slightly large",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QAI2G0WOXFVV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWH5NPDQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 13, 2024",Color: Blue FloralSize: Medium,,"This dress arrived carefully folded and came out of the package without a wrinkle. The colors are vivid and stunning and the fabric is silky and soft with an airiness that moves beautifully with your body. The straps are adjustable and the back tie means this dress can be adjusted to fit well in the top no matter what your shape. This does run a little large in the waist area and I will need to take mine in. I went with the measurement chart and the recommended size (medium) and the elasticized back is too loose for me (I am 5'4"", 140 lbs) I could have ordered a small and had this fit a bit better.  This dress is beachy and beautiful and would be wonderful on a trip or cruise. If you are fairly short as I am you will need a bit of a heel as this dress does run long even as a maxi (which is fine with me since I live in heels) This comfortable, stylish dress will be cool in warm temperatures and would travel well, it is lightweight and wrinkle resistant. It also comes in a wide variety of colors and prints.  This dress does not have much stretch, but doesn't really need it because the top is adjustable and the waist has elastic. The fabric, while being silky and cool is not at all sheer or see through. This sundress is really beautiful and will become a favorite go to for summer!",2
