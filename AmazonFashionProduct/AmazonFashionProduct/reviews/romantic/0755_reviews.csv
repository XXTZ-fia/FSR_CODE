Lisbeth,Amazing dress but with a caveat,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BL04V0GMSWM1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C487XHP7,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Size: 20Color: Black Gold,Verified Purchase,"Let me say first, that the dress was delivered on time. The fit was perfect and the dress is gorgeous! I purchased the reccomended size 20 and I am 5'8"" and around 225lbs. I was a little worried when I was first putting it on that I might not be able to get it up over my hips/ butt, but without too much trouble I got it on. Honestly I could just pull it over my head if needed, it'sjust habit to pull it up. The dress was not at all baggy, though the length was a little long, it will work out perfectly as I plan on wearing low heels.  Now the downside. There was nothing wrong with the product itself, but when I opened the package, I noticed the bottom had hair on it. Unfortunately the more I looked, the worse it got. There was hair all over the dress. Obviously someone used and returned the dress but it wasn't inspected very well before being put back on the shelf. I don't have time to re-order and get a new one in time for my party, so I am going to try and clean it the best I can. But unfortunately that means I can't in good conscience give it the 5 stars I otherwise think this dress deserves.",

Douglas James Macur,POOR QUALITY - I  would give it a 0 if I could.

I slipped the gown on upon arrival and put it away knowing it was the correct size and all I needed was to have my dress hemmed.  My scheduled appointment to hem the dress was coming up so I took the dress out, put it on and found the zipper was installed incorrectly causing a bulge next to the zipper.  This was unacceptable to wear to my son's wedding.  Having only a few days before  my seamstress appointment and knowing it would cost more than the gown, to try and repair it, if it could even be fixed, so I ordered three other gowns from Amazon.  Fortunately, one of those was perfect and I returned the other two from that order.  I know that the ""returned date"" for the defective (unworn) dress was well passed.  I contacted Amazon directly to see if they could make an exception due to the circumstances of this defective dress.  Very disappointingly, Amazon would not make an exception for a return on this defective item.  I will be sure to never order anything too early from Amazon again and will avoid purchasing from Ever-Pretty through Amazon.",

While I received many compliments tonight, I wasn’t exactly comfortable. First of all, PLEASE KNOW THAT YOU CANNOT wear a bra with this dress. I did have this dress for several months, so it was my fault that I didn’t figure this out before the big day. Also,  if you carry any weight in your stomach, the light gray color accentuates it.
