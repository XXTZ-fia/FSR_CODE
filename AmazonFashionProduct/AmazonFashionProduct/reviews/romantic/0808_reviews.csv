I should have listened to the reviews calling it frumpy 😅. With a corset maybe it'd be an acceptable costume piece, but to charge more than $15 for this is criminal and it's listed for around $50. I tried an underbust with it and still couldn't keep it knowing how much I paid. The seams don't line up right, and one looks to be coming undone, about to make a hole in the side. It's the kind of material that will always be wrinkled but at least it has a lining and the color is pretty accurate. Can't lift your arms at all, whatsoever, or the whole dress comes up. Pass on this one or find a cheaper listing imo. It's not the worst thing ever, but certainly not flattering or comfortable to move in. I got a large for my height, and it still sits a little high for me at 5'9. Rvimios has one with better reviews and it's cheaper, so if I try this style again I'd look there first. Only bought from this listing for the color. (no pockets BTW)",

I wore it to a summer wedding, and I received so many compliments on it. Here’s what I loved about it:  Pros:  Stylish and Flattering: The off-shoulder design and puffed sleeves give it a romantic, boho-chic vibe that’s perfect for warm weather. The high waist and A-line cut are super flattering, creating a beautiful silhouette that made me feel confident and feminine. Comfortable Fit: The dress is made from a lightweight, flowy fabric that drapes beautifully without clinging to the body. It was comfortable to wear all day, even in the heat. The elastic around the shoulders and waist is snug but not too tight, so it stays in place without needing constant adjustment. Versatile: This dress is incredibly versatile. I dressed it up with heels and jewelry for the wedding, but I can easily see myself wearing it with sandals for a casual day out. The ruffled hem adds a playful touch that works for both formal and informal occasions. True to Size: I ordered my usual size, and it fit perfectly. The size chart provided was accurate, which was a relief since ordering clothes online can sometimes be tricky. Cons:  Sheerness: The lighter colors are slightly sheer, so I recommend wearing nude undergarments or a slip underneath to avoid any see-through mishaps. This wasn’t a deal-breaker for me, but something to be aware of. Wrinkles Easily: The fabric tends to wrinkle a bit, so you might need to give it a quick steam or iron before wearing it. Again, a minor issue considering how gorgeous the dress is. Overall Impression: The ZESICA Women's Off Shoulder Puff Sleeve Dress is a must-have for anyone who loves boho-inspired fashion. It’s flattering, comfortable, and versatile, making it a great addition to your wardrobe for 2024. Whether you’re attending a wedding, going on a date, or just enjoying a summer day, this dress will make you feel like the star of the show. Highly recommend!",

I'm breastfeeding exclusively and wear my baby in a wrap constantly. This dress is perfect for my wants and lifestyle! The neckline is a nice square when the sleeves are up or straight when you wear it as an off the shoulder dress. The elastic neckline pulls out of the way easily to feed a hungry baby! The material is so soft and comfortable. I love to wear it and it's so effortless to look nice without being uncomfortable. It is nice and lightweight so it's not super hot, but isn't see through thanks to the built in slip. I would say it fits true to size. I'm 5'7"" and 165 lbs (still holding onto that baby weight) and am currently a 38 DD. I bought a large and it fits like a glove. It's flattering so my slowly returning waistline and my husband thinks it's stunning on me. I love the white and plan on getting it in other colors! It washed up nice in warm water and I threw it in the dryer (who has time to hang dry stuff with a baby?) And it dried nicely. I hung it up and it didn't hold any wrinkles. 10/10 would recommend to a friend!",4

The dress shipped from California yesterday, 6 days after I purchased, and expected to be delivered by 10pm tonight in New Jersey. Thankfully it arrived with plenty of time before the wedding.  The dress was shipped in a clear ziplock bag with holes in it, allowing for dirt and liquids to get inside and stain the dress (thankfully this did not happen) and the ability for someone to just take the dress out of the packaging during shipping.",
