If you are larger in the bust, this may not fit you well, but I was able to fit into it with a 36C bra size. I did like that the waistline was not particularly constricting. On the minus side, though, I don't think the sky blue color was quite what I expected from the product photos. The promotional photos made it look like a more dusty, muted, midtone blue, while the actual dress I received was a pastel powder blue. It just wasn't what I hoped for, and not a color that works particularly well for me. The lace of the dress is also on the stiff and itchy side. The frills are cute, but also more than what I personally like. Overall - if you like the color and styling of this dress - maybe it is worth it for you.
