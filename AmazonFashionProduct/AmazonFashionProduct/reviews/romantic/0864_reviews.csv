That's the only reason that it didn't fall down on me.  The color is very nice, and the seams and stitching are well done. I don’t see this fraying unless my cat managed to get to it.

I love the pattern and the way it flows and breathes. It’s perfect for staying cute while beating the summer heat! My main issues are with the waistline and the straps. The waistline feels a bit frumpy. I wish there was more shape to it, because as is it either disappears under my bust or bunched up in unflattering ways as I move. The straps are too short to be comfortable worn up on the shoulders, but there’s really no way to keep them from becoming twisted if you wear them off the shoulder. I also wish the slit was either a bit higher or a bit lower - maybe it’s just me, but the height it hit was just a bit awkward on me. I definitely would not recommend paying $40 for this, but it worked for what I needed it for on short notice!",10

Chika,The prettiest dress I've ever worn. But the zipper broke after only wearing it once.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PDYYIX80JUUV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBHR9V1J,"2.0 "," the United States "," August 24, 2024",Color: Purple RedSize: X-Large,Verified Purchase,"It was a very pretty dress and flows so nicely when you walk outside in the summer breeze. I wanted to wear it again for a party, but some of the teeth in the zipper had broken off (around where the elastic waist is) and now will no longer zip up. For $50-60, I expect a dress to be worn multiple times at the least, no matter how pretty it is. I can't return it, but I can do my best to learn from this experience and pay more attention to the quality of materials in the products and how they are arranged in its design. I don't think such a weak zipper should have been used on the side of the dress, because it is the weakest point in the structure. The part of the dress with the elastic waist has thicker material and stitching there, casuing a high amount of tension on the zipper in addition to the stress caused by a person wearing the dress. I strongly recommend upgrading the zipper. Even if I had to pay 10 extra dollars for a zipper that didn't break as easily, that is far better than only wearing it once and realizing you can't wear it anymore.",4

Another problem I had was the stitching along the top of the bust at the strap was sewn bunched up to the strap, dress had to be returned. I did order a replacement hope all goes well with that one.

On the positive side, the floral pattern is very pretty, and the off-shoulder straps are cute. They can be worn up, or off the shoulder. In either case though, you can’t wear a bra with regular straps—they would show. The dress does look okay from a distance, and it’s an okay maxi dress.  On the negative side, the dress is poorly designed. It fits poorly, and looks cheap up close.  In the stock photos, the dress looks like cotton, however it is a floral chiffon lined with cheap polyester. The chiffon is nice, but it doesn’t suit the style of dress. It looks more formal that the dress does. The ruched elastic waist is not snug in real life, so the bodice just hangs looking very mediocre at best, and certainly not stylish. Furthermore, the bust is very large, but with the ruching not being snug, there is not enough support for anyone who could fill out the top. Even the sweetheart neckline sits too high on the chest. Below the ruching, the skirt flares out, accentuating the girth of waist and hips. It does not slim or flatter one’s figure, and the knee-high slit does not add anything to the look.  Overall, the dress is made of decent material, but the loose waist and odd fit of bodice render the dress cheap looking and more like a nightgown than a flattering dress.",4

I am 3 months pregnant so I'm in that stage where I'm not showing but I feel so bloated and nothing looks good, I ordered a large which I need in some things but others seem to swim in that size, considering a growing belly I thought large would be good. I'm not sure how to describe how the fit was- the large fit great! It had plenty of room so I could easily grow in it, but I wasn't swimming it. It was a beautiful flattering fit, that I could have honestly probably went down a size in, but the bigger size for once felt PERFECT- which is hard to explain. Has a beautiful fit on the bust, and then an area of smocking right under which gives a fitted look. The skirt is then flowy from there down and it so beautiful and flattering I feel on any body type. Has a slit but isn't too revealing it's absolutely perfect. The bust also has that rubber banding around the top to help keep it in place so it doesn't slide down, although I don't really feel like it's necessary. The straps seem as though they could be worn on the shoulders, but is beautiful on or off which just makes this dress versatile!
