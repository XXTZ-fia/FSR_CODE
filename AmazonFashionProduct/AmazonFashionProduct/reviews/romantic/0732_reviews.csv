Anyways, I love the dress. Pros: The color is vibrant. The dress is not heavy. Cons: It's difficult to zip up and unzip, the zipper is of a bad quality and I'm worried it will break very quick. For this prize it should be much better. The dress is made for a taller woman then I am (5'3). I had to pull them to the shortest length there is. The dress is a bit stretchy which is good. In the chest area the lace is a bit too extended but it covers a bit of armpit, so, it's okay, even though looks strange. Maybe if I had bigger boobs it wouldn't be so noticable. Will I recommend it? Yes! I'm glad it came on time for a birthday party I'm invited to. And I'd recommend to buy a shrug either lace or sequined to cover shoulders and compliment the dress making it look like not just a summer dress but a cocktail party dress.",

So on the green dress, it felt a bit snug there. The black dress was so comfortable and flowy in the larger size. I normally wear a medium in everything but I feel like the large was more comfortable. The straps are adjustable so that allows you to pull the dress up so it's not so low cut. It's a beautiful dress and the lace is soft. I will say, the straps aren't entirely very sturdy so I'd handle with care. I love this dress! Definitely a great buy!",3

Overall, it fits great, but the cut on the side of the chest does pop out a bit, which is the only issue I found. It doesn’t seem entirely true to size—I bought a medium, but it feels a little big, even though I'm carrying an extra 20+ lbs. I'm a C cup, and the side still opens up slightly, so keep that in mind when choosing your size. I'll definitely update with photos when I wear it. But overall, I’m excited to have found a casual, beautiful white dress that’s perfect for a white party. I didn’t want anything that looked like a wedding dress or something I couldn’t wear again, and this one fits the bill perfectly. The material feels like great quality. It’s super easy to put on since the chest and waist areas are nice and stretchable. So happy I found this one!",
