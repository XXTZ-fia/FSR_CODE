She generally prefers looser-fitting styles and noted that this one is a bit snug, but it still fits her well. Personally, I think it’s one of the best-fitting dresses in her closet. From a quality standpoint, I have been unable to find a single thread out of place or any other manufacturing defect across the entire garment.  Between the gorgeous design and the impressive build quality, my wife has said this is one of her new favorites—and I don't blame her. That’s high praise, as she owns some very, very nice dresses!

The chest fit much better in the large than extra large but then the hips were tight which is ridiculous because they show it super flowy which is not true at all it hangs pretty straight. Also I get warm very easily in the long sleeves will make me way too hot I like the short sleeve ones I just wish the shoulders weren't so puffy.
