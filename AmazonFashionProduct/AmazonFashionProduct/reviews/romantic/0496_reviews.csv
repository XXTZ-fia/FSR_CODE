Kristy McMurray,Surprisingly Awesome – Influencers Redeemed,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R260SNDN2B44EY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNTLN1VM,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 9, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Solid Black,Verified Purchase,"Okay, I’ll admit it—I bought this dress with serious skepticism. Influencer links don’t always deliver, and I was ready to end up with a regretful impulse buy. But surprise! This black dress with white piping exceeded my low expectations. The fit is great (I’m 5’4"", 158 lbs, and the medium worked perfectly—maybe a touch roomy, which never happens). The length hit just right, so no awkward hemline drama here.  The fabric is thick enough to feel substantial but not quite thick enough to let you skip shapewear (sorry, gravity’s rules still apply). It doesn’t need a slip, though, which is a win! And I have to say, as a 45-year-old mom of five, I was nervous about how flattering it would be—but this dress totally delivered! It’s stylish, forgiving, and gave me a confidence boost I didn’t expect. If you’re on the fence like I was, this might just be the rare influencer win!",

The mad reader,Overall pretty good,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5AW9ADA7FFS7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNTLN1VM,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 2, 2024",Size: X-SmallColor: Solid Navy,Verified Purchase,"Sizing info first: I am 5'1"" and 120lb. I usually wear a size 2-4 or XS-S, depending on how forgiving the cut of the clothing is. Through a comedy of errors, I ended up ordering this in an XS instead of my intended S. The XS is wearable, but I think I might have been slightly more comfortable in the S. I'm too lazy to go through the return process, though, so I'm sticking with the XS.  Things I like about this dress: it's not too long on my short body. Bodice comes up high enough that I don't need a plunge-front bra (ignore the bit of my bra you can see in the pic, that was a particularly high-cut bra I just tried it on with). Similarly, the straps are thick enough to cover my bra straps. Fabric is thick and feels high-quality. The overall appearance is very flattering. I look..sexy?!  Things I don't like about the dress: the piping is attached weirdly, like on only one side of it or something. As a result, it sticks out in spots and looks uneven. The bodice is a bit too long for my short body, which means the waist doesn't sit quite right on my (but ymmv a lot). As I said in the ""likes"" section, the fabric is heavy, which is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it feels substantial. On the other hand, despite this dress being sleeveless, I wouldn't want to wear it, say, outdoors during the summer. The fabric pulls a little across my hips, but that could very well be an artifact of the fact that I bought a slightly-too-small size rather than any fault of the dress's. It's also just the slightest bit sheer at the parts where it stretches the most. Not enough to really be a problem, but just something I noticed. Finally, the zipper is...recalcitrant. I couldn't get it all the way up myself, even though there was plenty of room in the back of the bodice.  Overall, I'd give this 4.5 stars out of 5, but I'm rounding it up to 5 since Amazon doesn't allow half-stars. I'd probably buy this again, but I'd go a size up next time.",5

Happy I found this one! Nice thick material doesn’t feel cheap. I sized down to a small because medium wasn’t fitting right (not tight enough) though usually I’m a medium. I wore it during NC summer and I wasn’t too hot but we were indoors for majority of the night. A true white not cream so don’t worry about that. I do wish the piping was on the back of the dress as well but for the price I was very happy with my purchase and got lots of compliments. Many couldn’t believe it was from Amazon!,6

If you prefer a looser fit, I recommend sizing up by one.  Stretchy, yet plenty thick; not see-thru. High quality fabric.  Hugs curves and is super comfortable to walk and sit down in.  The only minor con is that the fabric made me sweat while indoors.... while my friend felt the need to cover her arms w a scarf in the Ac. That said, I often 'run hot'.  I love this dress so much that I plan to order a couple more in different colors.  Highly recommend.",19

I typically wear shapewear under tight form-fitting dresses like this, but you don't need any shapewear with this one!!! The material is amazing, it snatches you, gives you an even curvier look due to the lines, it's incredibly flattering on the chest, and doesn't require a bra! The only thing I will say is that the white lines along the side do not stay straight/flat, they appear squiggly when you wear it, but I think it adds more character and dimension to the dress, so I'm not mad at it at all!",2
