I received it with a stain that took several washed to get out. The sizing does run big even after you wash it. It has belt loops at the top but it didn’t some with one. It is see through so I would be careful with what you wear underneath. It is long but I was able to wear boots and it not cause any issues. The top clasps did keep coming undone through me wearing it. Other than that it was a good baby shower outfit to wear.,

The material is light. The slip underneath does great. It’s only see-through at the bottom where the slip stops, which is very pretty, delicate looking, yet holds up around the action of children at a family reunion for thanksgiving.  I have toddlers and got gravy and cranberry sauce on it (dress is light cream color). I washed on a regular cycle, and the dress looks brand new! The lace trim and everything held its shape and placement perfectly.  I bought another color I was so pleased with the durability and quality of this dress!",

ML,So fun to wear! Lightweight flowing whimsical dress A+++,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LJ0UBL3TFMWW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3F44S7V,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 20, 2024",Color: WhiteSize: Medium,Verified Purchase,"This is the cutest little overall dress!! I saw it (as I am sure you are now if you are a jumper/overall lady like me and your eyes are popping right out of their sockets at the moment of how cute this is).  Size I am about 145lbs-150lbs 5’4 34C curvy athletic body I went with a Medium and it fits perfectly. The dress style is loose and comfortable (long A-Line type of dress). That said, I do buy clothes often in size large if it looks like the item might run smaller. This dress does not run small it is right on the money. If I got it in large I would be swimming in it and if I went with a small for a more fitted look well It would take away the forgiving comfort aspect of the overall look and feel.  I was trying to figure out what color to get but I gravitated towards the “white” color even though the apricot looks very boho/mountain/old fashioned country style (I like that too!) but I choose white and I am very satisfied.  As far as “see through” don’t wear black underwear and you should be fine, if you are worried about it you can double up on a slip and put a short slip on under the one that is build into the dress.  I find the material to be very breathable, comfortable, and lightweight in a good way (not in a cheep way)  Bottom line if you see this and your heart skips a beat like OH MY GOODNESS that is cute, and you have the right body shape for this style and or you have a piece of clothing that you are able to slightly compare this to that has worked for you in the past, I would say take a leap of faith and try it out.  Enjoy! And hope to see one of you wonderful ladies out there wearing this so we can be overall dress twins! PEACE <3",13

The sender was from a facility that isn’t even in business, but there was also a label from China under that one so I had no idea it was this dress. The straps are so short, I can’t make them any longer the pictures above are the longest they will go, the straps length look NOTHING like the picture. The rest of it however looks like the pictures. I would not buy another one, I also got an XL but fits like a Med I’m assuming because the straps are so short. Aside from that the lace details are pretty nice actually and the fabric is pretty nice feeling.",5

My only complaints are that the picture shows black straps on the black dress, I thought it had pockets, and there are weird loops along the backside where the denim meets the sheer. Wish the slip was a bit longer, as I have a long torso. Fits comfortably. For reference, I am 5’6” and 194 lbs. I bought a large and it’s roomy. Not sure I would have paid full price, I got it for 20% off. Happy with it.",11

It’s very “swishy” fabric. Somewhat itchy. It’s light and airy but I would have loved for this to be much softer and not so “slick”. I wish it was more like a cotton or linen type feel.,

Go for it. It’s pretty darn cute.,5

I will order a Apricot color too. highly recommend for this dress.",3
