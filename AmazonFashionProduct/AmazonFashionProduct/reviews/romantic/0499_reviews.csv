It’s a really pretty dress and I was excited when I took it out of its package. The only reason I’m rating it 3 stars and had to return it was that it didn’t look good on my body type. I have wider hips and that’s where the fabric protruded out and made me look like a cup cake. I strictly didn’t like how it looked on me which is why I’m giving it 3 stars. However the quality of the dress was very nice and very pretty. I recommend this dress for any women who don’t have wide hips, then maybe the dress will sit better and not make you look like a desert.",

I did notice some size inconsistencies across the colors. The purple was quite a bit larger than the other two. There is an option at the v neck to close it higher up and make it more conservative. I plan to wear dress tape to keep mine in place where I want it.  It is very light weight and for my body type, hits in all of the right places to be extremely flattering yet comfortable. I know I would feel pretty, confident, and comfortable in this on a day where I’m bloated as well, which is HUGE!

I’m 5 feet tall, 160 pounds with a bit of a gut, and I really didn’t want to end up looking like a round blob or have my boobs spilling out. I also wanted to find something that would cover my arms and stomach because I’m not a fan of showing those areas. This dress turned out to be exactly what I was hoping for! It fit perfectly and had the flowy sleeves I was looking for, offering great coverage without feeling bulky.  The length was perfect for my height—just grazing the top of my feet when I wore wedges. If it’s a little long for you with wedges, the waist is constructed in a way that you can pull it up slightly to shorten the dress a tad more. The dress is a beautiful pink color, and I received lots of compliments throughout the day, which made me feel so pretty.  One thing I wasn’t thrilled about was that the bottom was a bit sheer, with a slit that exposed more than I was comfortable with, especially since I have spider veins and prefer to keep my legs covered. I had no trouble taking it to my local seamstress, and for just $7, she sealed up the slit for me, which was an easy fix.  The dress does come with a built-in slip, but I added a shorter slip underneath to avoid a ""Princess Di"" moment—especially since it was an outdoor wedding...just in case. Overall, this dress was the perfect choice for me. I felt confident, comfortable, and, most importantly, pretty!",4

I am 5’4”, I weigh 185lbs., and I like my clothes to be loose, so I tend to wear a 2x or size 16. I’m pretty sure wearing this dress was the first time I felt beautiful again since the birth of my son. It definitely is not really an everyday dress, and it is a little more fancy, like for a nice dinner, a wedding, church, etc.  The dress is well made, and even in the sun, it was not sheer or see-through. I was amazed at how comfortable I felt wearing it, and one of my favorite parts was the little snap at the top to keep it closed, and it was in the perfect location for me!

It’s not a true wrap, more of a faux where an elastic waist sits under the bust area. There is a little snap to provide “modesty,” but it popped like a champagne cork. The belt was ridiculously looped onto one side and was impossible to undo while wearing the dress. Very delicate belt loop. I took the dress off so I wouldn’t break the loop and it broke anyway.
