It’s not too short or too long. It’s stretchy but more cottony feeling. Easy to dress up or wear with some white sneakers. I like that there is a bit of a bunched up area along the seam, it makes it super forgiving even on days you feel bloated.",

So many compliments on this dress.  Fabric is a stretchy t-shirt material but not super thin.

The red was the same as the picture with the ""v"" in front and was double lined and it a nice dress. The black, however, was not the same dress at all! It was very very thin, a ribbed material, no tag whatsoever, and did not have the ""v"" in front and was much more ruched. If the dress is like the red version I would recommend it but size down. I got a medium and it was too big. The black dress Ultimately is okay just not at all what I was expecting and would definitely be better for summer.",
