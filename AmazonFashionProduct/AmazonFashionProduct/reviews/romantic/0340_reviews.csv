I was recently window shopping and saw a super cute pink dress in a store window. The dress was over $200... because of the brand. I told my daughter I wouldn't pay that price for that dress... buuuutttt... if it was turquoise (my favorite color) I just might. I did an image search, and LUCKILY that brand did not have turquoise, but I found this one in my color.  I was very skeptical, because I've returned the last 6-ish dresses I've ordered from Amazon. I wear a size small in most things, but dresses like this, the chest is usually much too small because my top is not proportionate to a size small (34DDD). But if I go up, the rest of the dress is usually frumpy looking. This dress fits PERFECT!!!  It's true to size and it's extremely adjustable to fit larger and (I'm guessing) small chests. Seems very well made. So super cute!!!",2

Amazon suggested I buy large based on others reviews, but I tend to purchase size small in dresses. My lower half is like a size 12, but my upper half is more like a 6. My bust is quite small. It turned out I needed this dress in size small, so I ordered a small and sent back the medium. Before sending back the medium, I tried both on multiple times. Due to the tying nature of every part of this dress, the only main differences in sizing are the size of the cups and the length of the skirt. If you are small busted, go for the size small even if your belly and butt are size 16 or larger.  The fabric of this feels wonderful, and I feel super cute in it. It is very flattering. The light pink floral was absolutely adorable. Sadly, that was the size medium I had to send back and does not come in size small at this time. I loved it so much, though, I plan to check back here often for that size to come available again. In the meantime, I am enjoying my light blue floral almost as much :)",5
