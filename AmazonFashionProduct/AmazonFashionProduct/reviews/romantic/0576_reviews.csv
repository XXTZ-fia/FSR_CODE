Ordered the white and when I put it on it took some major adjusting to get it to fully cover my chest but as soon as I sat down the fish-bone bodice pushes everything up. Great dress overall but I wouldn't recommend at all for a larger chest. 36DD - XL didn't do well.,

And the thigh slit started weirdly low.  But apart from those downsides, the corset lacing worked great, it matched the size chart pretty well but maybe a touch small, and I got a ton of compliments. I wore a strapless plunge bra, I cut the bodice strings way shorter, I used the cut-off strings to tie the straps together behind me to make more of a racerback style, I folded the corners of the bodice into my bra to make it look like a sweetheart neckline, and ironed the dress because it arrived wrinkled. With those little alterations it’s still a great dress.",

The fabric is soft , it has nice contouring from the waist through the hips, and a flattering strap placement.  the problem is ALL in the chest area. Instead of having the tie string be fed through the cups, it is sewn on to elastic. So when you pull them tightly, it pulls the elastic, expanding the fabric (vs gathering it further) and making it very oddly shaped. There is no tension in the cups so my post baby chest was bean shaped (even with cakes in). Very unflattering and super bouncy.

I didn’t really want to buy a $200 dress when I was unsure about the fabric as their dresses are known to be loud when you move. But the dress is to die for. So I decided to try this $50 dupe first. The waist cinch of the corset on the back is fantastic and works like the real dress. There’s actual boning in the corset too. I do find that if your small chested you will have issue with coverage. I tied the cups as tight as I could and I still feel gaping for a B cup. This is the only part that really worries me. The house of CB dress has 2 breast size options which I now know why. I liked this dupe so much that I decided to have this tailored. Because even if I bought the original dress I’d still have to get it hemmed because I’m too short (5’1). So I paid 90$ to shorten the dress and to raise the thigh slit and it’s the most perfect dress now! The tailor in particular was really obsessed with this dress too. I got about 2.5 inches off the length and raised the slit the same.,10
