Not at all.  Seams in side and in pocket were already frayed and open when it arrived.  Waist too high.  And it doesn't cover you.  Chest not covered when belt tied, and lower legs and feet not covered.  It needs 3 inches added  on left and on right front panels to be a useful robe. I'm returning it.",
