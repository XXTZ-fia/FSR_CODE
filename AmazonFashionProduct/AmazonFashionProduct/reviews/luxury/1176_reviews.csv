It's medium thickness and feels like a very expensive dupe. Don't be thrown off by weird sleeve placement, it's supposed to be that way so the shirt is easier to wear off the shoulder. DEFINITELY size up if you want to wear it fully off the shoulder and have it stay, you could even go up two sizes (I promise it won't be overly large since it's supposed to have a relaxed look). The only reason this is 4 stars and not 5 is that this top is fitted at the bottom even with sizing up and isn't as long as you'd expect or hope with a larger size. Tall girls can wear, but don't expect it to fully cover the assets (mostly covers the bum, but not 100% for tall gals), you can pull the sleeves down to the hands but it looks better with them scrunched up. For reference, I'm 5'11"", 200lbs, athletic build, usually wear M or L in tops and got an XL in this. The dark green is a gorgeous color.",3

Here’s my take on it:  Quality and Comfort: The sweater is made from a really nice, soft material that feels great against the skin. It has a good weight to it, making it perfect for cooler weather. The craftsmanship is excellent, with neat stitching and no loose threads—definitely a high-quality piece.  Style: The off-the-shoulder design is lovely and trendy, offering a relaxed yet chic look. Unfortunately, I realized that this style just isn’t for me. While it looked good, I didn't feel entirely comfortable wearing it off the shoulder at my age, which is why I decided to return it. That said, if you love the off-the-shoulder look, this sweater would be a great addition to your wardrobe!  Final Thoughts: Even though it wasn’t the right fit for my style, I can’t fault the sweater itself. If you're into off-the-shoulder designs, I think you'll love it. The quality and softness are top-notch, but it just didn’t work for me personally. Returning was an easy process, though, which I appreciated!",11
