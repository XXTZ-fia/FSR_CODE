They’re great for a night out or a nice dinner. I ordered my usual size 8, and they were just a little tight. I thought they’d loosen up, but it doesn’t seem like the kind of material that will, so I’d recommend maybe going up half a size. Otherwise you’ll need to wear no socks or those really thin ones. I did get some blisters my first night wearing them - time has yet to tell if that’s a recurring quality. All in all, they’re not the most comfortable. I probably wouldn’t choose them for going dancing or a long night out. But for a nice dinner party where you want to show some pizzazz, they’re very attractive!",

Plus, they are remarkably comfortable, with arch support and a cushioned insole providing all-day comfort. The elegant buckle detail adds a touch of class to these already stylish shoes.

Plus, it's comfortable too, so even if the event lasts long, I don't think I'll get uncomfortable with these loafers. The gold buckle on the top of the loafer looks fantastic and complements the black color perfectly. It's outstanding and wonderful, and considering its quality, the price is reasonable.",

My only problem with these is that they feel like they are about a quarter size too small. For some people, this tighter fit is perfect, for me, it's a bit tight.",
Gryffindork,Velvety goodness.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKOD9B0GL7M5H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRVXLF6S,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 21, 2024",Size: 7.5Color: Purple,,"These Reihuanne velvet loafers are fun and stylish.  If you really want to stand out in the crowd, these will probably do it for you.  The purple velvet looks lush and the soles have a textured surface so there's a little tread there to work with.  These shoes seem a little longer in the toe area than most, so it looks and feels slightly off there for me.  I wish the buckle was a little smaller and silver colored instead of gold.  That's just personal preference though as I don't like big, gold hardware.So overall, I do like these shoes, they just have a couple small quirks for me.  I deducted a star for the longer length of the toe area and some tiny spots on the shoes that look a touch sloppy.  See my photos.  The sewing isn't great at some of the seam ends and a smear of glue got on the velvet while (I'm assuming) gluing the soles on.  I probably won't be able to remove the glue either, since it's dried directly onto the velvet.  Anyway, the quirks are most likely not noticeable to the people standing near you but still, for the amount, and being advertised as 'fancy,' I expect less haste during the creation process.  BTW, my photos make the purple color look really washed out but in reality, it's nicer.",
Jobeth Carlton,A showstopper for sure. A shoe-stopper!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29CFO63X31PVY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRVXLF6S,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 21, 2024",Size: 12Color: Black,,These are absolutely gorgeous in person. They do fit true to size and they aren't narrow or wide just average.  We got the black pair and it's a true black that somehow doesn't seem to gather as a bit of dust around which is pretty impressive. And I'm saying that as a former mall goth who is used to wearing all black and being covered in pet hair!  They didn't take long to break in but even after a full evening of wearing them at a wedding they're no worse for the wear! They still look brand new despite being more comfortable once they loosened up just a tad.  Overall I'm very impressed with these and I would definitely get more shoes from this company because I really wasn't sure that these could be NEARLY as comfortable as they ended up being!,
Jean-Pierre,Fabulous way to look fabulously chic without wearing polished shoes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28XCA1SV08H2D/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRVXLF6S,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 21, 2024",Size: 9.5Color: Black,,"I'm a spit-and-polish kind that has a reputation for a mirror shine on my dress shoes. I saw these, though, and was intrigued by the thought of wearing velvet. My style is that I wouldn't wear these with a suit, or if I've put on a necktie, but certainly with slacks and a blazer. The brass is noticeable in an elegant way, and not overly fancy or large that it's gaudy. The right shoe's hardware has a couple of very small bumps, but because the metal is so excellent polished, no one would notice the imperfections from beyond a foot away.  I wear 9.5 or 10, depending on the shoe. These looked a little longer in the toe box, so I ordered 9.5, and they fit me GREAT, even when my feet are semi-wide and need a little room in the side. When I put them on and walked around the house, I was astonished how comfortable they are, like I was wearing house slippers.",

Men seem to only have so many articles of clothing that they can wear to add a 'pop' of color when wearing traditional formal wear. While I can take risks with 'going out' clothes. I wanted these to wear to a wedding that I will be attending. These will go great with the tie I have chosen and bring the outfit together. I decided to break them in, and wear them out for the day. After a day of chores, I can say that the shoes are very comfortable. Not really meant to wear for a lot of walking, but for simple tasks, like running to the grocery an such, they were fine. I really like that the soles are soft and they really stay on your feet. I have purchased a few men's shoes where the sole was very hard, and caused the back of my foot to slip out. These will be perfect for attending special events where you can stand and maybe dance a bit. I also received several compliments on these.",
Suzanne,"Blue suede shoes? No, blue velvet!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12HBY6K8HJXXU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRVXLF6S,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 17, 2024",Size: 10Color: Royal Blue,,"I ordered these REIHUANNE Men's Penny Slip-on Velvet Loafer Luxury Suede Tuxedo Dress Shoes Fancy Smoking Slipper Party shoes because my teenage son fell in love with them.  My kid loves midcentury menswear. These aren’t actually a penny loafer (what we were looking for, he needs a new pair) but he loved the bright blue color. He loved the idea of wearing blue suede shoes… although these are actually made of velvet.  My son’s feet are wide. He usually wears a wide shoe size, but these fit him well. I think the velvet fabric has some extra give to it.  These really are the bright blue in the photo. The shoes are long, they have a bit of additional narrow shoe beyond his toes, but they seem built that way. The shoe gets quite narrow at the toe box beyond the end of his feet.  These are great for costumes and could be fun for a prom or dress occasion. Be prepared for the blue suede shoes jokes.  Well made velvet loafers are comfortable to wear. Bright blue velvet and bright gold hardware make a super styled shoe evocative of extreme styling from the 50s and the 70s. Fun for costume, dress, or even everyday wear.",

Not because i had concerns, but because I didn't want to have to choose a color. The blue looks beautiful, the black looks fantastic, but the purple completes the look and that's why I chose it.  I will have to step up my game to ensure they stay looking good, but simple enough. Avoid water. Check! Use a brush when needed. Check!  Comfort. They are like walking in a pair of your favorite slippers. Like walking on a cloud. You'll soon forget you have them on, and those are the best kind of shoes.",
