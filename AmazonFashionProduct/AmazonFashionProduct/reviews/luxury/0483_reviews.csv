Josephine Erickson,beautiful shawl,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JEXMI5AS47XO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B4NSHJC2,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2022",Color: White,Verified Purchase,"I ordered this shawl for my outdoor January 1 wedding.  When it first arrived it was smooshed and wrinkled and I didn't know if I would like it.  I hung it up over a drying rack for a few days and let it ""air out""  (no- it didn't smell).  I was hoping the wrinkles would come out - and it worked!  I wore it on my wedding day and it was perfect for a chilly outdoor wedding.  It also photographed beautifully.",5
