The material is thick and snuggly, somewhat softer than a standard bath towel.  Not quite as luxurious as the waffle robes you get at a spa, but it's still a good robe for home/everyday and definitely beats wrapping up in only a towel. The length of the robe, sleeves, and belt all feel just about right and I like that it has big pockets. One thing to note -- even completely dry, this robe is pretty heavy (part of why it is so warm and snuggly). Because of the weight of the fabric, it needs to be hung on a sturdy hook or hanger, especially when it is wet. I had a not-so-sturdy older ""command"" hook on the back of my bathroom door -- the robe was too heavy for it and the hook fell down. Since then, I hang this robe on a hook that is screwed to a stud so I don't have to worry about it falling or pulling away.",

My robe did come with a belt loop on each side, and it works well enough.  It does not have an inner string, though, so the only thing holding it closed is the outer belt.  Might not want to go running through a communal area in this, but for around the house, it's perfectly fine.",

I actually liked that it was a little softer than some I have tired before and I loved that the size covered me at 5 ft 8 inch it was about 6 inches off the floor which I found to be a great length. Another robe I have fit way to small and this one was a great size. I also loved that it closed with a little extra room and I’m not exactly super thin but also not too large and it fit me well. I loved that the robe came with two loops and the basic belt to tie in front. I also liked that it had two pockets for carrying your phone or keys or whatever you like.  I did find it a little thinner than some I have used at spa’s but it still covers everything it needs too so not a huge deal. It also had a funny smell right out of the package which isn’t a huge deal. Overall I really liked it and will definitely be using this robe.,

The sleeves are long and to my wrist. I am plus size, it doesn't have a lot of extra room, but does fir comfortably. I will not be drying it as it is 100% cotton and may not fit if I was to dry it in the dryer. Also, says not to bleach so this will be a struggle for me but hopefully not an issue.",

It’s still ok for whatever you’d use a robe for, just not soa quality.",2

That's ok, I have every intention of washing it. But, be aware...don't gift this directly to someone because of that. Anyhow, the size is good. For reference, I'm 5'6 and 160# and have plenty of room. My husband is 240#, and it's not generous enough for him. I like the length falling halfway from knee to foot. The sleeve length is also nice - not quite 3/4...a little longer, but it doesn't interfere with what I'm doing with my hands. The fabric is super soft and absorbent. There are two large pockets, too.",

Arrived just as advertised.  Zero complaints here.  This robe provides awesome coverage.  It is well made. Although it is lightweight. It is NOT sheer. Doesn't feel cheap.  Made of 100% Cotton.  Because of this, the robe is breathable and moisture-absorbent. Which is what you are looking for. The exterior feels ultra soft and the inner towel-like lining was equally as impressive.  Felt lovely on the skin.  Not stiff nor harsh at all.  Just like the robes at the spa, this robe has the long length I was looking for.  On my 5'5 frame, the robe was almost above my ankles.  I was able to adjust the belt to my liking as it has two loops to choose from. Any gender will be pleased. I would recommend 👌",

Grady,It is like having a full body cheap towel in robe shape on you,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UVD3WSV5JXI2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09M7JB9JP,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 27, 2023",,,"The ribe came in and instantly tried it out. A lot (I mean a lot of fuzzy and lint was coming off). For those in the US, imagine a Walmart cheap towel and imagine it being full body size and shaped like a robe - that is what this feels like.  I read other reviews and saw people saying no belt loops for the belt sash but this had them. They were so high up though, just about middle of my chest. I am about 5' 9.5"".  It felt very cheap but I don't mind too much. The inside has some type of tighter stitching but feels more like it was designed for something else. My towels for my car feel nicer.  Do not get me wrong, it does feel like a cheap towel but also feels very absorbent also. I think it will be nice to wear from the bathroom to the bedroom without having to worry if a window is open.",
