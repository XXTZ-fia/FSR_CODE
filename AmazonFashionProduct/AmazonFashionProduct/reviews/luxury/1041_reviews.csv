KEVIN H.,Add some charm,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PO5B5R45O2DJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB12R8K9,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Size: T-style EarringColor: Brown,Verified Purchase,I purchased a set of earrings for a gift on Amazon the earrings are very nice but the box the came in was less than satisfactory. I ordered this velvet top box and it made the earrings look far more expensive than they really were. I am very pleased with the quality of this jewelry display box.,
Abby,Flimsy inside,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JZ609D6NBBIO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DB12R8K9,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 1, 2024",Size: Long T-style EarringColor: Navy Blue,Verified Purchase,I wanted a pretty velvet box that would nicely display a pair of stud earrings.  The box arrived and there was this white outline on the top of the velvet part of the box. The earring holder inside is basically a piece of paper. It’s not very solid/strong.  Do not buy.,
