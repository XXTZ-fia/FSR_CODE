It fits right and looks gorgeous. Unfortunately it was the only thing in the box (no shipping material) and placed face down so the stones rubbed on the bottom of the box every time it was shifted in transit and some of them wore right through the plastic packaging. Surprisingly this didn't do much damage to the stones except the large stone under the right eye dislodged and was loose in the box when it arrived. Since the mask is all black with blue stones the empty gold cup that held the stone is very noticeable. If I re-set the stone with any glue that doesn't dry completely transparent it will also be very noticeable. Would have given 5 stars if a little paper or something had protected it.,8

The picture makes it look like it has black on the edges but it does not. I needed the mask in a hurry or else I would have asked for sure even though the description did say silver. You can't always be sure. Also make sure you are handy with a glue gun cause about 75% of the crystals fell off. After reading other reviews I expected that and being a crafty person it didn't bother me, but if you are looking for something to wear immediately out of the packaging you may not be able to with this style mask. Also because Amazon fulfilled the order it did arrive in an Amazon box, not just plastic packaging like others have mentioned.",2
