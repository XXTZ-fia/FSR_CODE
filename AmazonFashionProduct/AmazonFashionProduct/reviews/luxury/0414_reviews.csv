Steph,Tip of Shoe Wore Off Right Away,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OS9HAL8DIXWC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK2XLHYP,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 28, 2025",Size: 7.5Color: Brown Flats,Verified Purchase,"After one day of wearing the shoe at a conference (carpeted floors) the tip has worn off. Additionally, people are right that the two straps on the back are tight enough not to need a buckle but they often shift off making them very awkward to walk in. I was hopeful but the show is just poorly made.",

Janis W.,Casual Yet Chic Shoes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2X1SFLAUVI2WA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK2XLHYP,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",,,"The color of these flat pointed toe slingback shoes is a perfect navy blue. The textured grain embedded in the leather gives them an expensive, tailored look, and I love the cute, rounded, square heel. These shoes are versatile enough to wear with dresses and skirts, but I find them better suited for casual outfits like jeans, but that's subjective.  I normally wear a size 7; sometimes a 6.5, and I went with the 6.5 for these. It fits, though a 7 might have been better for my heel. But because they are very pointed, I think the enlongated point of the shoe would have made a half size up look overly large, so for that reason I'm happy with my choice.  The price is hefty at $138, but they are a stylish and versatile pair of shoes that offer many options of wear - from casual to chic.  Unfortunately, they lack arch support and are very flat, which might not work for everyone.",

The pointed toe style is great to wear with wide leg jeans giving you an elevated and up to date look. This blue color flat is beautiful and will pair nicely with jeans. A subtle snakeskin design. The bottom sole does have grips. I’m a true 6.5 in shoes and they fit perfect, which is 37 in European size. My only gripe, is the price. It is pricey and not many people want to spend over $100 for a pair of flats. But overall, these are nice and comfortable. If you don’t have a budget, I recommend bcoz they are beautiful.",

I have a small foot and feel this shoe elongated my foot enough. I sadly won't be keeping the pair as I needed them for a trip to Paris and don't believe it would be great for long walks with how loose it fits. If it were for any other reason I believe I could make them work.",

These are best for a medium width foot. I have a narrow to medium foot and they fit great. A wider foot might find this too tight.  Okay, sizing issue aside, these shoes are very nice. Not sure if they’re $128 nice, but you can decide on that. The soles are rubber, not leather. They have a strong rubber/plastic smell. There’s a clear peel off adhesive sticker on the soles that you need to peel off before wearing, or you’ll slip and fall.  I think these are cute business professional shoes, but at this price point I’ve seen better construction.",13

Perlas,How gorgeous and elegant these pair of shoes are! 🥰,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KPKPSEAZUVZH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK2XLHYP,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 22, 2024",Size: 5.5Color: Pink Flats,,"The very first C.Paravano shoes that actually fit me perfectly and that feels extremely soft and comfortable all around. 😍 I usually wear size 5.5 on sandals and pump shoes, which C.Paravano doesn’t carry any half sizes shoes. I’ve purchased their size 6 pump shoes and they were too big and hollow on me. The size 5 pump shoes were too tight on me. None of these pump shoes felt comfortable to walk in either, despite them being made of lamb leather. Finally, I purchased these “Slingback Flats for Women | Pink Flat Ankle Strap | Womens Slingbacks Pumps | Pointed Toe Slingback Flats | Womens Slingback Flats | Slingback Shoes(Size 5),” and they fit me perfectly. Not only that, they’re one of the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever worn! I think that these style fits me perfectly despite it being a half size smaller than what I normally wear, is because they’re sling backs, giving the back of my heels extra room. Other than that, I would not be able to fit in any of their pump shoes unless, they start carrying half sizes.  As for the quality of these shoes, they are very well-crafted and durably made, with a special focus on not just looks but, also on comfort. This shade of light pink, which is more like rose or coral pink, is absolutely stunning and chic to look at. The leather is soft, smooth, durable, and finished with excellent stitching all around. The sling back is so comfortable and not too tight and not loose either. The flat heels along with a soft and cushioned footbed feels like I’m walking on a cloud. These shoes will look absolutely stunning to go with semi-formal outfits like slacks, nice skirt and a top, or with a nice dress or business suit.  That said, I absolutely recommend these pink sling back shoes to others, as these are totally worth the asking price. Hope this review helps. Thank you! 💝",
