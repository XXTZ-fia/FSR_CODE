ADR,How SWAY!? this is amazing!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWD9Q5EA9D2B1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D173RRR9,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 1, 2024",Color: Taupe/Purple/Pink,,This is amazing quality and good idea to have 6 built in clips into the head band bandana. it's super easy to achieve a hair wrap look.,
Jana,All That AND Alligator Clips!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VQRJXHBKMOED/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D173RRR9,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 30, 2024",Color: Taupe/Purple/Pink,,"Finally, a head scarf that stays in place without having to tie it so tight it cuts off my circulation to my head (yep, it happens). This scarf is soft, shiny, and pretty and the alligator-style clips lock into place in my place (simple, but genius).  I love that it comes with a guide and instructions on different styles to tie the headscarf.  I ordered this scarf in Taupe/Purple/Pink and it is just the right colors to go with most of my wardrobe, so it’s really versatile.  The only thing I’m not sure of is how to wash, so I’ll probably wash by hand due to the clips.",2

It shipped well with minimal packaging. They emitted no weird odors or chemical smells. It was not wrinkled nor does it lend to wrinkling.  It is true in size at 28 x 28 inches. The thinness is just right not being heavy nor too light. It has six clips placed strategically so many styles can be enacted. There are no rough edges or poking parts.  It is made well with no loose strings, off-seaming, or areas where the material would falter and come apart.  The pattern is lovely not stretched out or distorted in the least bit.  I love that the generous size lends to not a few but many ways to style this headband.  Recommended.",

I got the pink floral one, and it looks very pretty and vibrant. The headband is soft and silky. There are 6 clips sewn into the headband, they're small with rounded tips that do not poke your scalp. The clips make it easier to wear this headband in various styles. This headband is definitely on the expensive side, but would make a nice gift to yourself or someone who like headbands.",

Dilly Dahlia,"Pretty, versatile, and stays put",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L6XJKGL6MHWQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D173RRR9,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 15, 2024",Color: Blue/Gold/Turquoise,,"I have an odd head and find it hard to keep a satin scarf on, so I was excited to try SWAY. I wear a satin scarf to bed sometimes in a vain attempt to protect my curls. It almost always falls off, but this scarf has the comb stays built in and that means my scarf stayed where I put it despite my mid sleep tantrums and tossing about work in the morning.  The pattern is pretty, so I decided to wear it out as a folded band with my hair fluffed up. Y'all I danced my heart out, did the limbo, and definitely threw my hair around while having a good time and it stayed put. I also got compliments.  Quality scarf, nice and silky smooth and soft on my curls. The scarf is long so it fits my big ol melon...basically I love SWAY and will pick up a few other patterns.",2

They are great quality and easy to style. I've worn them under hats, styled them for my hair up/down. The clips hold them in place. I struggle with migraines. On those days, I put the clips in place without snapping them, and they still stay exactly where I put them. I have thin hair and no problems wearing these.",3

I absolutely love the unique hair clip that is sewn into the scarf to keep it in place.  The scarf is made of a quality material that is soft to the touch and vibrant in color.
