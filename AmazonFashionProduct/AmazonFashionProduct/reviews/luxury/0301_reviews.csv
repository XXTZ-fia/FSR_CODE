PENNY,I love these sunglasses,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJZSLP5U0SDUJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWGRF4HG,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 6, 2024",Color: Silver/GreyLens Width: 53 Millimeters,,"These sunglasses are super cute.  I like things that are different and these have a great retro shape and metal rims.  I chose the black and grey color.  They go with anything I wear and I've already had lots of compliments.  They are very light and comfortable  to wear and they come with a pouch, a cleaning cloth and a key chain screw driver so you'll always be ready if you need to tighten one of the screws. These glasses also are said to block 100% of UVA and UVB rays so they do a great job protecting my eyes.  They come in lots of color combos so I may just order a few more.",

AD,So chic and I love it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPF3FHCX3CU9C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWGRF4HG,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 3, 2024",Color: Gold/G15Lens Width: 53 Millimeters,,I was not expected that this sunglass would be this perfect. It arrived in a nice box that includes of small key chain screws that you can use if at anytime any of the screws are loose and you need to tight them. The sunglass is so chic and it looks so luxury in person. I think it's definitely worth it specially that it's so light and you can have it on for hours and it doesn't leave any marks or spots on your nose/face.,
OnePickyMom,Fun Retro Sunglasses!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H060BGFBFT7L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWGRF4HG,"4.0 "," the United States "," June 30, 2024",Color: Black/GreyLens Width: 53 Millimeters,,"These Breaksun Retro Oval Sunglasses look like they are a throwback to the late 90's or early 2000's to me. They seem well-made in general. I'm not sure how well or long they will hold up, depends on whether the frame was simply painted black or not. It is hard to tell at this point. They are fairly cute ""on."" (and I'm pretty picky about sunglasses on me.) The lenses are very dark/black, so no one can really see your eyes through these, but you can see fine looking out through them though (not distractingly dark to peer through...) The lenses are clear to look through (meaning not foggy looking, seem like a good lens). The nose pads sit evenly on my nose bridge. (I always worry about that with sunglasses with nose pads to them.)  I think these sunglasses are cute in person, and I would get them again, but I think next time would opt for this same style sunglasses, but I might try the silver frame rather than the completely black ones.  Both are cool looking though. Can't go wrong! Note: These come with a little storage bag and a key chain glasses screwdriver, which is a nice ""extra"" for tightening up  the screws in your frame as needed.",
What's new?,Relive the 90s! [Breaksun’s Retro Oval Sunglasses in Black/Gray],https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCYMPDOHNWR91/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWGRF4HG,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 26, 2024",Color: Black/GreyLens Width: 53 Millimeters,,"Breaksun’s Retro Oval Sunglasses in Black/Gray are a very nice fit for those with a flatter bridge (aka “Asian fit”).  They fit snugly on my medium sized head, but since there isn’t an expandable hinge at the temples, those with larger heads will want to pass.  Construction is decent and this is valued fairly at $14.99.  This pair really does remind me of my old 90s glasses.  Comes with a cleaning cloth, eyeglass screwdriver, and a bag for storage.",
