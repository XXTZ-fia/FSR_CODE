She is quite active as well. I thought this would be a great outfit for her to just wear around the house so she could be comfortable without having to be in pajamas but guess what? She loves it so much that she's been wearing it to all her functions.  I got her the grey which is soft and flattering color choice for her. The edging is actually more cream than white. I ordered the medium according to the size chart. It has a loose fit but on her, does not seem too baggy. She has a petite frame nowadays so I was concerned it would be too much fabric for her but it really isn't. I thought about getting the small but I'm glad I didn't. I think the waist band might have been too constricting for her in the small. The waist band is stretchy and wide so that helps with the comfort of this outfit. Also, the top is a little shorter in length than other sets I've seen and I like this a lot better. It balances out the wide leg of the pant and is more on trend and stylish.  I thought the fabric would have been softer, like sweatshirt material, but it is a more dense, thinner feel than that, if that makes sense. It's still soft-just not as soft as sweatpants. It also appears to be well made. Nothing was loose or coming apart anywhere that I could see. As far as ""washability"", I'm not sure about that yet. My mom is not too rough on her clothes so it might be a bit before it needs washing. If there is a problem , I will alert you!  The neckline is a little matronly but it depends what jewelry and other accessories you wear with it (shoes, purse, hair, etc). I would have liked a square, vee neck or lower cut crew neckline better. Still, for the price, this is a nice set!",12
