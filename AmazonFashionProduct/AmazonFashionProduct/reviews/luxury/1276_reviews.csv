Khoi M. Vo,Pay attention to the size chart.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19NFXDCMY5ZQQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B087LRDW4V,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 27, 2023",,,"I bought this in a size Large, which is what I normally get for other shirts/jackets that I purchase. The Amazon page also said that ""Large should fit me best."" Shame on me for assuming that would be true. The jacket is far too small and I will be returning it and purchasing an X-Large. However, upon looking at the size chart now, it does seem that a Large from this company is only meant to be about a size 40R suit/40.6"" chest. A previous reviewer mentioned that the size chart was inaccurate and said a Large would fit a 45"" chest, but this must have been updated now. Therefore, I will take responsibility for not double checking the chart, but it should still be noted for other purchasers that this jacket will run smaller than one you might get from another company. I will also say the jacket material seems fairly thin, but it is indeed very shimmery and will work for what I need it for.",

I’m going to keep it and get it tailored for me but I have no idea how this was supposed to fit a man of the size on the size chart, esp in the arms and shoulders as it’s tight on my shoulders and I’m not built like a man.
