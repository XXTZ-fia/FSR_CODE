Aaron F,Great. Runs half size small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3G9U26PQYHNLK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BZXZ58RP,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 8, 2024",Size: 8.5Color: 1 Inch Quilted Black,Verified Purchase,Better than expected! Fits slightly small to size. After reading reviews I got a 8.5 when I’m usually a 8. Cushioning inside makes it comfy. Looks high end. It does gap on the sides when I walk but some shoes without much arch support will do that for ppl like me who have really flat feet,

JJB,Very good knock off of a much more expensive brand,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQLNJJGIVFTI1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BZXZ58RP,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 5, 2024",Size: 8Color: 1 Inch Beige,Verified Purchase,"I fell in love with this style and colour of shoe on a designer brand’s website, but refused to pay the designer price. When I found a pair that looked exactly the same on Amazon, I had to buy them. These flats are true to size, not too narrow, and were comfortable when I first put them on. After wearing them at the office for 8hrs, walking a mile to and from the restaurant for lunch, and around Target after work, I badly needed some bandaids for my baby toes and my left heel as I could feel blisters starting to form. This could be due to needing to break them in a little more. It will not stop me from wearing them to the office tomorrow though! Overall I found them extremely comfortable to wear all day. There isn’t any arch support, but my back did not hurt at the end of the day when I took them off like it does with some flats I have worn. Overall I feel like they are decent quality and very on trend right now. Highly recommend. Just break them in first before walking a country mile in them!",7

Arrived very fast. The best thing about them is they come in half sizes. I wear a size seven, but a couple of people commented they were a bit snug. So, I ordered a seven AND a seven and a half. The seven did fit but it was very tight.  I could have stretched them but the seven and a half was perfect. Now, in fairness, it has to be said, I was flying somewhere and wearing them and flying home so I know my feet were swollen and maybe that is why the seven was so tight.  But they are lovely and comfy and I ordered them in every color.",15

However, the heel on the actual shoes in about 1/2 the height as shown in the picture on Amazon and made of a rubberized material rather than the solid ""wood looking"" stacked heel in the picture.  It's less sturdy looking than the one in the photo.  Also, the shoes have a terrible smell - possibly glue?  I'll be returning these.  Too bad, because they're cute but with the different heel I don't feel they'll wear as well and therefore are not worth their $69 price tag.",3
