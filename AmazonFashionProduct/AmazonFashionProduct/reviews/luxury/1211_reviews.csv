SK,This robe is oversized as stated so pay close attention to the size you need.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NLR1Y06W2P9I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CQCC6S9,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Size: 4X-LargeColor: Wedgewood,Verified Purchase,"What I like about this robe…it is very soft and warm. I like the looser style to fit over pajamas and keep me warm on these chilly nights.  However, I did not give this robe 5 stars because I feel the sizing is inaccurate.  All of the models in the sizing guides are well above average height  (in US about 5’3”) and other than one, they are all very slender.  The robe is pictured as calf length.  I am short (5’2”) and not slender.  I ordered the size based on the guides wanting a loose fitting robe that would wrap around me and that would be ankle length on me.The robe meets those criteria…ankle length and wraps comfortably around my larger middle.  However, the arms are ridiculously long….at least 5” beyond my finger tips. Just because I am short and my middle has grown does not mean my arms are any longer than they were 50 pounds ago.  I will need to have the sleeves shortened, as there is way too much fabric there to roll up.Overall I am happy with the robe and the color, material, and quality of it.  I recommend that before you buy, double check your sizing to avoid disappointment.",

The quality is outstanding—sturdy stitching, a well-designed belt, and deep pockets that are perfect for keeping my hands warm or carrying small items around the house. It's both cozy and lightweight, which makes it ideal for year-round use.  Length is nice—it’s long enough to provide full coverage without feeling bulky or restrictive. The style is elegant, so I feel put-together even when lounging at home.  One of the standout features is how well it absorbs moisture after a shower. It dries quickly, leaving no damp or uncomfortable feeling.  Highly recommend!",
