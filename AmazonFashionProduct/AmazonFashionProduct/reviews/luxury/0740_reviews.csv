For once, I was right and she loves it. I asked her to “review” it for me and this is her response.  “The quality is excellent – lightweight but definitely not flimsy. It’s a poncho, not a wrap, and the neck opening isn’t in the middle, so it drapes more on one side than the other. That’s not a problem; I just wasn’t aware of that until I got it. But it is perfect to dress-up slacks and a top. Unless you like showing some midriff skin, you definitely want to wear something under the poncho. I wish it were a little bit longer, but that is just a personal preference.”  “I got it in the Blueberry/White color, which pairs really well with white, as shown in the product image. But it also works great with black, which is my go-to color. This poncho gives me a splash of color, which I’ve been told looks good on me. So it’s been my go-to for both casual and dressy outings.”  Me again. She is correct, it really does look good on her and has kept her comfortable in restaurants where I was chilly in their AC. I am happy that she likes it…my choices for her do NOT always end so well.  The AMAZON VINE Review of the IN CASHMERE PONCHO SWEATER for WOMEN is FIVE STARS!  Five Stars for Soft and Luxurious Cashmere, Poncho-Style drape, Lightweight, Year-Round Use, and my wife LOVES IT!

It feels like a gentle caress against my skin, providing warmth without any bulk or heaviness. The periwinkle color is both delicate and sophisticated, adding a touch of feminine charm to my look. The design is both classic and modern. The relaxed fit drapes beautifully over my shoulders, creating an effortless and chic silhouette. The open front allows for easy layering, and the ribbed trim adds a subtle detail that enhances the overall aesthetic. I've worn this with jeans, leggings, and even dresses, and it has consistently received compliments. It's a versatile piece that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. Pair it with boots and a scarf for a cozy fall look, or layer it over a dress and tights for a more polished evening ensemble. It comes in one size and offers a comfortable and relaxed fit. The cashmere fabric is delicate but durable, and it's recommended to hand wash or dry clean to maintain its softness and shape. Overall, the 100% Cashmere Poncho Sweater is a fantastic investment for anyone seeking a luxurious and versatile layering piece. Its soft cashmere fabric, elegant design, and beautiful periwinkle color make it a must-have addition to any wardrobe.",

I am guessing the knitting is not as dense as my sweater, and thread weave is not as thick. I love the silky smoothness, and warmth (for the thickness) of you sweater. This shawl/poncho, I am pretty sure is not of that grade, and is of 3 star grade. It still feels smoother than say the merino lambswool of my scarf though.

It's decent quality cashmere, soft with a nice, fine weave. Best use would be for a short shawl for your shoulders on a night with a little chill in the air.  Cons: Item is very oddly shaped. If you put it on with the V to the front (as shown in many of the listing photos), it's quite short in the back. Also, the ""model"" (the most used model looks AI to me) in most of the listing photos must be less than 5"" tall and very flat chested, otherwise there's no way this would come down to her hips. I could never get it positioned in such a way that it looked right for going out in public. Every way I positioned it, it looked awkward. So, if you're taller than 5"" and have a large chest, be warned.  Given the cons, I do not find it to be worth the price.",

It is lovely, but is also dry clean only. (As expected.) Now, I wasn't at all impressed with the packaging -- it came in an everyday gift box, the top part of which was gold-colored. There was an inventory sticker on the box itself, and the box was somewhat crushed in shipping, as it had been put into a shipping envelope, not a box. The poncho itself was undamaged, but as this poncho is perfect for gift-giving, be prepared to re-package it. I love that there is such a variety of colors and patterns with this poncho, and though the price is high, I think it's probably in the right ballpark for a cashmere poncho of this size and style. This is a great luxury purchase for yourself or a friend or loved one you want to pamper, and adding multiple patterns and colors to a wardrobe would be a fun indulgence.

I’m 5’1 and 87 pounds so the poncho fit me a little big.  I forgot to take the tags off, but in the second photo you can see that the back of the poncho has white horizontal stripes on the bottom.  It is a pastel pink color. It is pretty thin and light weight, so I can see myself wearing it in the Fall, Winter and Spring. It’s not going to give you a lot or warmth, but it does give a very light layer of warmth. You can wear it a camisole or tank top underneath or with a long sleeved shirt.  The material is thin. I would have liked for the poncho to a little thicker, but besides that I don’t have any cons about it.  It is pricey, but keep in mind that it is made up of 100% cashmere which is an expensive material.",

Perhaps the design needs to evolve a bit more to be more practical.  Not a huge fan of the stripe pattern either.Overall, the product is not a good value at all if it's in the $80-100 range.

This one is very nice. I ordered the pale pink and it is a pretty shade -- no trace of peach or lavender. The listing pictures make it look sort of mauve. The one I got is a true baby pink. The cashmere is extremely soft and fluffy. It is knit, like a sweater, not woven like a pashmina, which gives it some extra volume.  Around the bottom edge are three, inch-wide, slightly off-white stripes. I didn't notice these in the listing pictures, although I see them now when I look. It is a lovely, flirty detail that I really love.  You can wear this as a poncho, adjust it to look more like a wrap, or drape it down the front like a scarf, which I think looks particularly nice with a coat.",
Hermione G.,VERY thin but not bad otherwise,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3J36ZCJA8KRL5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN4Y6RGD,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 11, 2024",Color: Pink,,"This is billed as a lightweight cashmere poncho, and that it very much is. The pink you can literally see through. I have no issue with that, other than the price not reflecting that fact - which we'll discuss later. The thickness is about the same as a woven cashmere, but it's a knit cashmere, so you don't get the same density. It's about heavy enough to use in a slightly chilly office, or to have on a spring or fall (summer even in some places) evening to knock off the chill when the sun goes down.  The fit is SHORT. I'm a short person and it's about waist length on me with front and back balanced. I could get more length in back by shortening the front.  The cashmere is soft. I frequently do have issues with cashmere, and this one did not give me any itch or other skin problems.  The color is accurate as regards the picture on the screen. It's a nice baby pink color.  At the end of the day, the only thing keeping me from a hard recommend is the price. This is super, SUPER lightweight, and not a brand name (so no markup for the label, in other words). When I ordered, it was $99, and at time of review, it's $79. I think the $99 is a NO WAY and the $79 is closer but still not what I'd call a great value.  The reason it's still getting 4 stars is versatility. It can indeed work as a big scarf rather than a poncho by using it longways around your neck. In that way, it's a year-round item in any weather since you can wear it as a scarf with the big winter coat.  Side note - it absolutely feels like cashmere to me, and decent quality at that, but I have not performed any destructive testing (burn test) so I can't swear one way or the other.  Oh - and as to the no additional wrap needed because it comes boxed - that's a NO. It does come in a shiny gold shirt-type box, but there's a big old bar code sticker on the FRONT of it. You could cover it with a gift tag, but it's not placed with that in mind.",
