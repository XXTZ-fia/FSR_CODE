And yes, these shoes are just as advertised, including sparkles all over and ""designer golden ornament.""  She's now calling me Hef.  (If you don't know who that is, look it up.)Sizing's an issue as the website says normal sizing and if you have a wide foot, go a size larger, but the images have you do your own measurement.  I made the mistake of measuring per their guidelines and then, with a wide foot, going a little larger.  So, my normal shoe is a 9 - 9.5, their measurement put me between 10 and 10.5, and I went with the 10.5.  But I should have gotten the 10.  So, make of that what you will.  (As a product tester, unfortunately I can't just return them for the right size.)My size issue notwithstanding, these have started out comfortable to wear - I would say right-out-of-the-box, but they don't come in a box, they're just in a plastic bag (""caution, don't suffocate the baby"").  And as per the website, these also definitely come with the smell of burnt plastic or something, so as they suggest, let 'em air out a bit before you stash in an enclosed closet with your finest linens and silks.  I can only imagine as to longevity they'll be like a few other tuxedo shoes I've owned and depreciate quickly after a few fun parties.You can't take yourself too seriously and wear these around, and they're definitely going to get comments of all kinds.  I actually got them because I frequently speak at conferences about things like new technology and the space economy, so I thought these would be great fun to add a little lightness to these events.

It's Mike P. here, and I just had to share my thoughts on the MHB Men's Luxury Velvet Loafers. Let me tell you, these shoes are a real game-changer when it comes to style and comfort.  First off, the velvet material is top-notch. It gives the shoes a sleek and sophisticated look that's perfect for any formal occasion. And the suede accents? They add just the right amount of texture to make these loafers stand out from the rest.  Now, let's talk about comfort. The slip-on design makes these shoes super easy to wear, and the pointed-toe design adds just the right amount of flair without sacrificing comfort. Plus, the cushioned insole provides support for all-day wear, making these loafers perfect for those long days on your feet.  But what really sets these shoes apart from the rest are the rivet details. They give the loafers a bit of edge and personality, which is exactly what I look for in a shoe. I've received so many compliments on these shoes already, and I can't wait to wear them out again.  Overall, I highly recommend the MHB Men's Luxury Velvet Loafers to anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable shoe for any occasion. These shoes are a must-have in any fashion-forward man's wardrobe. So go ahead and treat yourself, you won't regret it!",
willg,These are pretty comfy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIXLKEWYIEY8Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BPS8Y377,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 1, 2023",Size: 11Color: Blue,,"I saw these and just had to have them.  They look like a really cool ""opera slipper"".  They actually fit pretty well - i have a wide foot and these feel pretty good.  The heel is very grippy which is good. They are reasonably flexible and look just so neat!  I really like them.  I got the blue and the gold embellishments really stand out without being overdone if that makes sense",
Smiler,Fun but will they last?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PD2T7LJI6IE9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BPS8Y377,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 1, 2023",Size: 10.5Color: Blue,,"Fun color shoe with gold dots makes these a dressy yet playful addition to the wardrobe. They are narrow but fit well - I ignored the foot measurement chart and just ordered my regular size. They look good but not as 'velvety' as I expected Some missed stitching along the edge left about 1/4 inch unfinished on one of the shoes, but the other was fine. It's not very noticeable (except for the loose thread) but we'll see just how long these hold up.",
Amy Penton,So nice!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RS9NJGQRDLOG1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BPS8Y377,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 27, 2023",Size: 10Color: Green,,"These shoes are the perfect dress shoe. The material is super soft and the gold dots give them a touch of class without being too much. They fit true to size and look like very expensive shoes. These would be great for anything from a nice dinner, to prom, to wedding attire. The versatility makes them a perfect closet staple for any man's closet. The fact that they come in different colors makes them work for even more events and styles. I highly recommend them!",
R. D. HERMAN,Small and Narrow,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5E9PVCS27C6G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BPS8Y377,"3.0 "," the United States "," February 22, 2023",Size: 8.5Color: Black,,"As instructed and warned, size should be chosen by your foot measurement and not by your usual size as it was stated ""Please choose size by your foot length, the size you can choose from the size charts is not really US size is only according to our size table"". Big mistake! According to my foot measurement, I ordered an 8 1/2 (usually order 9 1/2). Guess what? Too small! The shoe also runs a bit narrow. Need to return. If you are going to purchase this, my recommendation is to order your regular size and forget the size table......and, if your foot is wide, this shoe may not be for you",2
