Rinde,Came in an old perfume box.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLKXZI6QBWK51/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BVRCXJCP,"1.0 "," the United States "," March 21, 2024",,,"Where do I start? First, it came in a perfect box. I thought it was a joke. Secondly, the glasses case looked old and worn and wouldn't even close. Thirdly, it was missing all the accessories included in this ""bundle."" I am so disappointed. I used the try before you buy option, so It's looked like it may have been returned many times and the are trying to get someone to pay full price for it. I got on Amazon chat 2 minutes after receiving it to initiate a return. I will be dropping it off tomorrow, so you may get the same box if you order this. We buy everything from Amazon, but will never order from Gucci ever again.",
