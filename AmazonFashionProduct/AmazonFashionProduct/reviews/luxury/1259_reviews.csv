DMB,Beautiful. Self winding.

Dali's ""Persistence of Memory"" is one of my favorite paintings and this watch design is inspired by that. I also like self winding watches. The watch is HEAVY! I weighed it and it is a little over 5 ounces, or 152 grams. The middle links on the band tend to reflect the colors in the room, see the picture of the watch in the case, the links look like wood because of the wood cabinet it was sitting on. It's a pretty large band, I will have to adjust it to fit, and bonus, the watch comes with the little tool needed to do just that.",

This is his comments.  My opinion of this watch is that it’s not waterproof. I would say it’s not even water-resistant. It’s safe to wear while washing your hands. The watch was very difficult to loosen to wear. When I finally managed to loosen it the pin came out, and it was different to put it back in. On the positive side, the watch uses kinetic energy to run, so it winds itself when you move. You can also manually wind the watch if it stops working. I also like the design of the watch.",

I love the delicate pop of color that this adds to my wrist as well. I have a relatively small wrist so I had to remove three of the links to reach my desired fit, but they were easy to take out and add in. They include a small screwdriver and the box is lined with velvet. This would be a great gift for any of the men in your life that like more unique offerings. It's eye catching too. I wore this once and got multiple comments on it and a coworker asked me what brand/where I got it. It doesn't look super high end but it's fun, and that's why I went for it. It isn't going to dupe anyone into thinking you have money, but it adds a fun classy touch to your outfits. Especially if you find yourself in a moe professional setting or like to dress up more often.  It can be hard to read but works and it's super easy to adjust the date or time. Instructions are included to help you along.",

I have a smallish wrist for a man, and 41-42 mm or so is about as big a watch as looks good on me. The first time I wore this watch I had a friend make a comment and ask about it. It really does look great, assuming you like the clean aesthetic.  Confusingly, on the back of the watch is says ""build in Detroit"" and ""USA movement with Swiss Parts."" The product description says it's a Japanese movement. I am confused, but also don't care that much.  The watch has a nice heft to it and feels quite solid. The leather band is surprisingly thick and sturdy, and includes clips you can use to remove or replace it. Even with my ""dainty man"" wrists, I need to keep it on the 5th loosest hole, so if you have a very large wrist you might need a longer band.  The packing is superb. It comes in a very nice box within a box, very suitable for gifting. You get a decent instruction manual (though designed for a watch with several complications this one doesn't include), a pillow for storage if that's your thing, and a tool for adjusting metal watchbands. I certainly don't need it for this watch, but it's handy for some of my others.  Setting it is dead simple - there's only time to adjust, and you do it by putting out the the crown, adjusting the time, and pushing it back in. The little complication for the second hand is nice and adds a little visual interest, but is also useful for actually timing things.  Overall I think it's a step up in quality from your basic, inexpensive wrist watch. It's not going to compete with a Tissot or Rolex, but it's significantly better than a typical $50 watch you get in a department store, in my non-expert opinion.",

It is not white like it looks in the pictures by Amazon, it's a brilliant silver. Not a bad thing though. It looks great and has a good weight not feeling cheapened like some other watches with hollow links. This bracelet feels solid and the clasp holds nicely. This is my 2nd watch, the 1st arrived with a malfunctioning chronograph reset button. When the reset was pressed, the 1/10th second hand would reset but the seconds hand wouldn't move unless you pulled the center crown out which immediately allowed the full reset of the seconds hand. I asked for it to be exchanged for the same model the afternoon I received the watch. The UPS man was there to pick up the return before lunch the following day. And on the 3rd day I received my replacement in perfect working order. I've never had a return to so smoothly or so quickly! Freaking amazing! I really like this watch and the price is unbeatable with it comparable to all my MUCH higher priced pieces.  P.S.: No, I haven't been paid, given anything, or otherwise compensated for this review & I bought the watch with my $. It's legit. You won't be disappointed.",

When I saw them on Amazon and poked around their store, it looked like this is only the second watch style they have made. They are pretty new. I took this as an excellent opportunity to pick up a good watch from a new maker, and I am also a sucker for silver watches with blue faces.  The listing describes it as a luxury watch. I don't know what exactly classifies a watch as a luxury. However, it is pretty on par with others I have. The look of it is similar to one of my Bulova's. It is also battery-powered too. The quality of the casing and band feel just like other Nixon's and Citizen's I own. It has a sharp polish and makes the watch shine. It looks fantastic. The blue face, with a few orange-tipped hands, set in a silver case, gives the watch an overall great style.  I have used it for over a week, and the time has been perfect. It has not lost one second since I initially set it. The stopwatch complication is standard and works well. The complication buttons are tight and difficult to push in right now. This tells me the watch's internals are well-made and will last for a long time. The dial knob holds tight, too, and it hasn't slipped at all, either.  The band comes with a decent length. I had to remove four links to fit correctly, and they included a link remover with extra pins. Typically, I remove three or two links. It should have no problem fitting larger wrists. The link pins also pop out easily. The watch itself came well packaged and protected. Everything on it was covered in plastic film, and there was not a single scratch that I could see. From there, the watch is wrapped on a thick cushion in a box that comes in a box that also came in a box. If I order a watch online, that is precisely how I want it to come, and also so I know it wasn't a returned item. ILLIMITE did a great job on that. In the box is also a warranty card (the size and feel of a credit card, which is how old-school watch warranties came to), but it didn't say what was covered by the warranty.  If you love watches like I do, I recommend picking one of these up. Chances are they are going to increase in price because they do feel well made. It has been a great watch and is a style that I personally love. I am glad I took a chance and got one. I have no regrets. I could also see these being a great middle-range groomsman gift or a gift for high school grads.",
Dan L Do,Looks and feels of excellent quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL1QL4QXIAWOV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK6V719M,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 19, 2024",,,"The ILLIMITE watch is a functioning chronograph. Modern chronograph watches such as this utilize sub-dials in different ways to measure long periods of time. The large second hand is used to measure seconds, while separate sub-dials count minutes and hours. A third sub-dial counts seconds in the normal function of the watch.  This watch also has a small day of the month indicator, which I find is very nice to have. However, I wish the indicator was a little bit bigger because it is hard to read.  As with most analog watches with luminous dials, being able to see the time in the dark is nice, but the luminous material kind of fades the longer you are in the dark.  The stainless steel wristband on this model has many links, and is easily modified to fit your wrist using the included tool. This particular model is water resistance to 100 meters.  The watch looks and feels well-made and of excellent quality. There is a cleaning cloth included, and the manual has instructions on proper care.  I’m more than pleased with this watch. The quality is very good and it’s nice looking.",
CaOhio 88,Solid build quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RO58S351JQUET/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK6V719M,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 16, 2024",,,This is a big step up in quality from most inexpensive brands. I particularly like the low light glow. The chronograph works without issue and zips back to zero right away. I like that the 10 o'clock button is really a dial that controls your outer chrono ring that advances or turns back your zero minute. Band feels ample in sturdiness in the wrist. Unit just seems well built and designed. I would also like to point out that it seems robust without feeling extra heavy. Feels pretty average in weight on the wrist. Very similar design to a designer brand that I have to compare it to and I can't tell which I like better. Both seem of the same quality. Both utilize a Japanese quartz movement.,
