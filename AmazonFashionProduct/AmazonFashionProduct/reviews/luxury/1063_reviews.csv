There is an outside pocket, two inside slip pockets, and two inside zippered pockets with an open pocket between them. I use this crossbody and love the thin strap. Not only does it look better than a thick strap but I find that somehow the weight is more evenly distributed and does not weigh me down as much as a lighter purse I have with a wider strap. I have already ordered a second bag in a different color. I do wish that it would come in a lighter color like a saddle tan as the current colors are a little dark for summer.",6

There was a bit of a discount, so I paid around $80.00 for it.  I received the bag quickly and in perfect condition.  I like the look of the bag but there are some cons to it, imho.  I do not like how thin the leather is.  The bag is so thin and light, and the lining appears inexpensive.  I'm really not sure how well this bag is going to wear.  I may just use it as an occasional bag, beacuse I do like the shape and color.  As others have said, the shoulder strap is very thin for the size of the bag- it's unlikely that I would ever use the strap.  It did come with a dust bag, so that is a nice touch.",2

I only paid that and got it because I liked the style and was like well guess I'm getting a genuine leather bag but I compared it to a real leather bag I have its no where near the same material and first thing that tipped me off is if you've ever bought real leather the smell is very potent when new this didn't have that also it's usually advertised all over the bag there isn't one single tag on this bag saying it's real leather.

It is made really well, it feels nice too. It is not too big, nor too small, and it's a style that is always in style. So owning it already makes me feel so fancy. That's obviously the most expensive purse I own but it seems, based on the quality, to be worth it.

You have to understand me, I can't just carry any bag, it has to be just the right lenght(13 to 14) inches, it can't have a divided middle, has to have outside zip up pocket with one in the inside also. I don't like decorations on my bag, no silver/gold buckles, no tassels, no two toned material, no crocodile, no shiny material, no initials, no designer's name on bag. This one suits me just fine and I am going to call to see if it comes in gray..also, it has to be short handled, if straps come with bag, I don't use them...It's the Iswee satchael tote bag......",
