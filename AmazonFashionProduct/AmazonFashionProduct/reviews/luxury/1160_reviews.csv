Angel Noir,"Beautiful, but perhaps not for the sedentary.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7J5LO5303TOS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07G369YSL,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 25, 2021",Color: Silver and Brown,Verified Purchase,"The watch is beautiful, I get compliments on it as well. It has three tiny red jewels visible at the hub of the spinning gears and the base of the pallet fork... I think that's what the little visible armature is called. I'd love it even more if more of the inner workings were exposed, though.  As you can see, I purchased the one with the diagonally oriented housing attached to the external crown. I specify this because I can only speak for this model. The crown is ONLY for setting the time, and to do that, you twist it anti-clockwise to release it from the body of the watch. Once you've done that, you may continue to twist it anti-clockwise in order to set the time. Once you've done that, push it back in and twist it clockwise to screw it back down to the frame.  Now, on to the workings and every day use:  There is NO way to wind the watch apart from the semi-circular pendulum inside the watch (located at the top of the watch in both images.) The pendulum should swing as you walk or move your arm, winding the watch spring as it does so... Loudly. It's quite a loud little pendulum. The only way I can describe the sound is... Imagine a coach's whistle when it is rattled, or shaking a jingle-bell with your fingers muting the ringing.  ""You say it's loud, Angel. How loud is it?""  It's loud enough to be distinctly heard at arm's length. It's not too bad, but it might bother some people.  ""You mentioned it's not for the sedentary, what did you mean by that?""  Ah yes, back to the headline. The watch keeps very accurate time as long as it's kept wound, but you either need to be quite active to keep it wound up, or you need to flick or shake your wrist every so often to keep the spring tensioned.  Working at a desk all day and night, I didn't have much opportunity to keep the pendulum swinging and the watch eventually wound down. By the time I noticed, it was over 30 minutes behind.  So unless you're up and walking for a good portion of the day, be sure to give your wrist a few good flicks every so often to keep that spring wound.  I cannot speak for the watch's water resistance, I take it off to exercise or to do any washing up. I've seen some of the reviewers were not satisfied with the watch's seals, so I don't want to risk ruining it.  Overall I am overjoyed at owning this watch, it has one job that it does very well and looks amazing while doing it.",2

It (and about four other watches from this seller) is a clone/knockoff of one of Invicta's Russian Diver watches. It looks good, and seems to keep time pretty well (and if it doesn't, you can always bring it to a watch shop and have them adjust it). The lume on the hands is pretty good, but only lasts about 5-10 minutes. The rotor foes wind in both directions, but is quite loud and seems to take a bit more force to move. The rotor itself is clearly coated brass (there's an area that wasn't coated properly). The screws on the strap lugs are fake, and are just press-fit caps (which I pushed out from the springbar holes). The springbars that came with it are terrible, and kept falling off, I reccomend buying a strap with springbars included (the lugwidth is 22mm) The strap that came with it is a cheap leather one, that I think doesn't suit the watch. The skeletonized barrel lets you see how much energy the watch has left (spring wound closer to the middle means more charge). The open balance wheel and escapement really looks awesome, and lets you know at a glance that the watch is still ticking away. Speaking of ticking, this watch is LOUD. I can hear it clearly on my nightstand, where my other mechanical watches I can only hear if I hold them up to my ear.  Overall, this seems like a great watch for just $35, and I intend to check out sone of the other watches this seller has to offer.",10

It is a self-winding automatic watch, it does not wind.  If you wear it all day and then put it away for no more than 8 hours, it will keep moving.  But anytime more than that it won't hold the tension/ charge(?) and just stop.  But it's easy to correct the time, no date /day to to set.  One reason I bought this was for the screw down crown and the chain, it looked real cool on the pictures, but I can tell it's gonna break one day.  But it does seem to catch everyone's eyes.  Isn't that the point?  :)  The strap was exactly as the other reviews stated, stiff and cheap.  I put a nice leather band and a deployment clasp.  Now it feels and looks great.  And we all know how little we paid for it.  I wear it as a 3rd or 4th watch.  Perfect for a casual night or a day date.  It's not something I'd wear all day.

So I ended up returning it. I decided to purchase a new one to give them a second chance. I'm glad I did because this little watch is amazing! Keeps accurate time. Looks great and is an amazing conversation starter. I also upgraded the band with a more durable mesh band to give it a one of a kind look.

The mechanism is compact for a mechanical watch and entirely visible. It has some other unusual features. The cap, which is attached to a chain, unscrews. On mine I can't change the position of the crown which means I can't use this to wind the watch. This is not a deal breaker since the watch starts with a slight movement of your wrist and, unless your incredibly inactive, it will keep time while you wear it. I can only advance the time forward not backward. I can't comment on the accuracy of the watch because I haven't had it that long but mechanical watches have a reputation of not keeping good time. So if you want a inexpensive watch that keeps good time stick to Timex. If you like watches as such you'll find this an appealing curiosity.",

I did replace the band, I wasn't expecting much from the leather band that it comes with. It's okay but I got a metal band with silver and gold to go with it and it looks really nice. Watch and band all together for less than $50 that's a steal.  This watch is just great to look at. I also like that the hands glow in the dark, a lot of skeleton watches don't have that.

It's NOT automatic, because the pendulum is loose (or mine is), sometimes it moves but does nothing to wind up the watch. Although the watch does work with your movent because of the rotor so you don't have to wind it up so often but the fabricants should make this clear. It's just a mechanical watch, and as such is a very nice timepiece. 2. The instructions are very poorly made, it's just a folded half-letter piece of paper and it doesn't fully explain how the crown works. Besides this piece of the watch is very hard to set and mine just got stuck in the #1 position. It works but I can't get it into the winding position. And I can't return it for my geographic position, it would be very expensive. I could buy a Stürling watch for that price. So the watch is very nice, but the advertisement is misleading. Buyers beware.  Update: I checked the mechanism more thoroughly through the glass and I saw why the crown was so hard to turn on and off, there's something jamming the wind inside the drum, like some speck, so the drum rotates but the wind is always in the same position. Very disappointed 😔",

There is another review that explains the process.  Speaking of setting the watch... the movement feels coarse and fragile.  The winding action is noisy.  I will be surprised if it lasts 5 years.  The band is hard, and with the screw heads sticking out of the lugs, I expect changing bands will be a bear.

So I know a little about them. So here are my views on this watch.  It is a nice little time piece which is attractive to look at, and looks good on the wrist. For $35 it is worth the look, however there are also some issues with the watch as well. Below I have put a little chart on the pro's and cons of this watch.  Pro's: + This is an attractive watch that does look as good as the pictures show. + It seems to be fairly accurate at keeping the time, or at least as accurate as I need it for general everyday use. + Packaging is very good, and attractive as well.  Cons: - Despite it's attractiveness, the band is cheaply made and very light (the watch is light overall). - It seems to have a short movement, maybe 8 hours at best. This watch does need to be worn everyday otherwise it stops. My other watches have a 48 hour movement meaning that they will stop if I do not wear them for 48 hours or more. This seems to stop if I remove it for one night. - to change the time, you unwind the screw, I have had it unwind almost all the way. Thankfully however you can screw it back without changing the time - There seems to be no way to actually wind up the spring without actually wearing the watch. It is movement/Kinetic only winding.  For $35, I really was not expecting much and I got what I expected. a decent little watch which is good value for it's money.",2

Bert Brecht,For lovers of mechanical beauty and high value.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22K5XTHCKK2HV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07G369YSL,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 27, 2018",Color: Black and White,,This watch has some problems.  It had a bit of loose metal filing inside so I purchased a kit to remove the cover and take it out.  It is a mechanical auto wind but the rotor is tight so the only way to wind it is to spin it around in your hand for about 60 seconds a day.  No manual wind via the crown.  Setting the watch is a challenge because the hands only move in one direction.  Go over by 1 minute and you are going to be spinning the dial for another long while.Why am I giving this 5 stars?  It's the coolest piece of mechanical engineering I own.  I look at the movement all the time and ponder how the human race could produce such an amazingly complex and beautiful thing for this price.  It keeps very good time and truly is my main everyday watch.,2
