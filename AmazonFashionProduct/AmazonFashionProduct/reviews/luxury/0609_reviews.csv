They are great quality, light weight, and look great on. The first pair was perfect but the second one of the crystals were missing so, I returned them. If you are a stickler for details make sure you pay attention to the rhinestone crystals.",

Monique C.,Stylist fashion glasses,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R229GC7VLPKJ50/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJTDKXSX,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 19, 2024",Color: C3* Silver Frame/Gray Blue LensLens Width: 65 Millimeters,,Smooth durable frames.

Alyssa,A Little Flimsy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31UABVJDUB4VL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJTDKXSX,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 18, 2024",Color: C2* Gold Frame/Gray LensLens Width: 65 Millimeters,,Fun frames and looks good on. The only thing is the price matches the glasses quality. The metal ears of the glasses are definitely a little flimsy and cheap feeling. They look good on though and they're great for vacation or just hanging out and I don't have to worry about losing them.,
Pitbull,Fab large sunnies,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PYKMI3GBN1ZG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJTDKXSX,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 17, 2024",,Verified Purchase,Love these large square frame - lenses nearly clear - very avant garde - get these sunnies!,
Melissa,Nice style but not the best quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NTYF5QWH9WPK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJTDKXSX,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 4, 2024",Color: C3* Silver Frame/Gray Blue LensLens Width: 65 Millimeters,,- The quality of this glasses is decent. - The temple is made of thin metal and it doesn't really feel comfortable. - These glasses weigh 35.5g so it is definitely heavy. - It feels sturdy and fits my fairly large face fine without looking oversized. - The blue tint is not really dark so i feel i don't get max sun protection from these glasses. - Overall i like the style.,
Penguin,Excellent,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP54V8RC6J5PZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJTDKXSX,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 1, 2024",Color: C1* Gold Frame/Champagne LensLens Width: 65 Millimeters,,Excellent craftsmanship and I appreciated the small screwdriver keychain that came with it as well as the velvet pouch to protect the glasses from any scratches or dust.  Great clarity through the lens and fits my face perfectly.,
a mom,Great designer dupe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L3N2WY5N0QRN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJTDKXSX,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 29, 2023",Color: C1* Gold Frame/Champagne LensLens Width: 65 Millimeters,,"I love a good dupe and these are fantastic for what they are, a fun and affordable way to try styles you may never get a chance to otherwise. And style wise, these are great. The style is on point and I love the soft amber lens. Really they are light enough to even wear indoors and I love the idea that maybe someday I just migh just walk on in to the grocery store and watch the heads turn. But they are good for outdoors as well, and the fact that they even have UV protection is a bonus and something I frankly didn't expect at this price point. Now do they feel like expensive sunglasses? Not particularly. And if you put the real ones next to these I'm sure you could tell them apart. But nobody is really trying to fool anyone with these glasses, that's not the point. As I said they are purely for fun and a way to import a little bit of style and fashion fun into your life without maxing out your credit card. Love them and can't wait to wear them!",
Catherine,Awesome sunglasses!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5SX8NW3EQYLX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJTDKXSX,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 24, 2023",Color: C1* Gold Frame/Champagne LensLens Width: 65 Millimeters,,"These sunglasses have a retro vibe with their oversized look, making an excellent addition to an outfit or look. I absolutely love the oversized look, and they are also simply fantastic sunglasses. I love the elegant metallic look paired with the yellow tint. Highly recommend these!",
Phuong Nguyen,Beautiful glass,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2V4KV6OK8ZOMI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJTDKXSX,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2023",Color: C3* Silver Frame/Gray Blue LensLens Width: 65 Millimeters,,"This is a loverly sunglass, very well made and package.

They are a tad bit bigger than the ones back in the day but I still liked the way they looked. The sides though, have no cushion and is definitely noticeable. They come in a box that can be wrapped and included is a soft case to carry them in and a cleaning cloth.",
