I personally don’t agree with other reviews mine look exactly as pictured . I do agree if you are in between sizes go a size down. They have a tiny bit of stretch.. not a ton. Just enough to be comfortable. Yet do not stretch out of shape too easily at all. Order these you will not be disappointed. Depending on The brand I wear a 24 or 25. Ordered both in this short not knowing. The 25 fit. I wear more and prefer my size 24. But won’t return the 25 as they fit just a tiny bit looser.,
