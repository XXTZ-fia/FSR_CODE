I even started to wonder if they were counterfeit boots. Then I got these. On day one I went for a three mile walk. My socks weren’t super thin but not thick either and these boots were perfect. No rubbing against my heel and the leather was not too stiff. One thing I did do was the night before wore them in the house for a few hours but otherwise they were great right out the box. Mind you these aren’t hiking boots but they were fine for a short urban walk. I bought my usual size. Unless they really stretch I probably will not be able to use with super thick socks. Also the rustic brown is gorgeous. Worth the money? You get what you pay for when it comes to shoes.  ETA: they did stretch and the next day wore thicker socks. Great boots.,2

I'm hoping I can cut down the amount of research required for whoever reads this review!  Color: I got the Rustic Brown, it is ever so slightly darker than the picture, but not far off.  Sizing: Blundstone sizing is a little different from most US shoes. I bought the US Women's 9 / US Men's 7 size on Amazon. The shoes I got are an AU Size 6. This does translate to US Women's 9, I just wanted to mention that in case you are comparing the sizes to those listed on Blundstone's website. Blundstone's half sizes (eg 6.5) do NOT add any length to the shoes, they are effectively just a ""wide"" size (so Blundstone AU 6.5 is just an AU 6 Wide). I have very narrow feet, so I chose not to go with the half size, even though I typically wear a US Women's 8.5. Instead, I sized up to a US Women's 9, which was perfect for my feet. They do come with optional extra insoles, which I have not put in my shoes yet. As they stretch, I might end up needing the insoles, but I'm not sure yet.  Comfort: Incredible. These shoes are AMAZINGLY comfortable, I was absolutely shocked by this. Most leather boots that I've owned are very uncomfortable and need to be broken in, but these were comfortable enough to wear for full days from day one. They also have quite decent support for boots! The ankle area rubs a bit on my leg, but I've been wearing long socks to deal with this so far, and I think it will soften up soon. But even without the socks, it is not rubbing enough to be painful or too uncomfortable. They are also not too hard to put on or take off, even right out of the box.  I've hardly taken these off since I bought them, and I really can't recommend them enough. I hope they bring you as much joy as they've brought me!",15

I measure to a 10D and 10E on brannock and normally wear a size 10M in running shoes and dress shoes. The boots fit generally good. They come with an extra set of insoles and I ended up adding the extra on the bottom underneath the ones they came with and it makes the fit overall very good. They are a somewhat roomy fit and not a lot of arch support. I have a somewhat high arch and a somewhat high instep and these boots would be more comfortable if they provided more arch support although the instep is not an issue as this tends to be a sore spot for me with pull ons like this. My ankles are a little bit narrow and there is a small amount of slip but this has not been an issue and is similar to wearing a western boot. The fit is overall roomy -- some may say a little sloppy. But they ARE quite comfortable and I'm finding the ownership experience to be very satisfying given the broad possible use cases and the overall comfort, look, fit, and price. I have worn them since I received them yesterday and have no sore spots and there is no break-in period from my standpoint. Workmanship appears to be overall good. There was a spot of glue on the top of the vamp of one of the boots but I was able to remove it (mostly) with a suede gum eraser. If I compare them to my work boots that I use for tractor work, chainsaw, mowing, etc, they are easier to wear than western style work boots and much lighter than the moc toe boots I wear when putting in a lot of steps. I don't perceive these as work boots although I COULD work in them but instead shoes for running errands, doing light chores, etc during the fall/winter.",

For this kind of money, it’s unacceptable.  EDIT: they wrote me back fairly quickly, but the process for them to just examine the problem was onerous.

After getting the new pair they seemed alright not as soft of insoles. I thought maybe they are just different types but after the bottom of my feet started to hurt in these new ones I pulled the insoles out of the used pair and they were the work boot insoles Walmart has. Grabbed a set and tossed em in my new boots after removing the old ones and it's a million times better. They are slightly thicker so the boot is a little snug now but not bad and might loosen a little with time.,

When I clicked order and viewed it, the image would switch from antique brown to crazy horse. I was afraid it was going to be that bright yellow mustard color but when I received it I was so pleased it was not. It reminds me of the color of timbs. It was easy to put on. I’m usually a 6, 6.5 and I had ordered walnut brown in 3.5 but It was hard to put on. I returned those and ordered these in 4(7). I really liked them but it felt like it looked big? I like when my shoes look small and cute and fit a bit snug. I basically put an additional insole to get the snug fit I like but still didn’t fit the best.  I ordered some kid size blunnies on the website in a size 4 but says 3 on them and they fit great (more as they stretch)  So I returned these and I went back to a size 3 hoping they will fit. I wanted this mustard color for pairing with greens.  The rustic brown is more versatile though.  I think these blunnies are comfy but I wouldn’t say the most comfy eg think crocs.  I’m hoping with time they will fit better and feel better.  Can’t speak to the quality as just received them.  Overall, for the sale price, I’m thankful!  Edited to add *****  I received the 3.5 They are quite snug and such a bother to get off.. which the size 4 were as well. But they are cuter imo and hopefully will stretch some. Glad I switched back.

I recently ordered these BL587 Classic 550 Chelsea Boots to have a nicer pair (the heels were wearing down). The new boots were sized inconsistently and do not fit. My original pair are 6.5 (I wear US 9/9.5 women's). I received these new ones which were too small even though they are the same size as the last pair (6.5) I had which were perfect from day 1. I returned them and ordered another pair of the same size (maybe there was a manufacturing flaw in that pair?) and I also ordered a 1/2 size up (7) to compare. The 6.5 were tight, and the 7 was significantly loose/ too big. I kept the 6.5 thinking this is the size I wear in this brand and they'll wear in. It's been a few months and it hasn't happened and each time I war them my feet hurt. I don't know what changed, it feels like when just standing they fit fine, but when I walk, they don't prevent my foot from sliding forward to the toe box and squishing my toes. Blundstone apparently has inconsistent sizing. I'm going to try ordering the 500 series again and see if the issue is the style difference (though they both look like the same boot style/shape.

The gamble paid off, though, because it turned out to be a men's 11 which is what I wanted. My true shoe size is a US 10.5 but I thought I would be safe getting a 1/2 size bigger which was a good call. The men's 11 fits like a men's 10.5. The only small issue is the top of the arch on the left boot is slightly tighter than the right. My feet are the same so it is the boot that is a little different. I do believe, however, that the leather is starting to stretch to accommodate that foot and the boot seems to be getting more comfortable on that side. The right foot was always perfect so no issues there. On the good side, these boots are absolutely beautiful and seem to be very high quality. They are expensive so they better be!

The leather feels stiff and they don’t look as high quality as I expected. The fit is good, I’m a 10.5-11 womens and I ordered the US womens 11 / US mens 9 and I received an AU 8 which is exactly what I expected. They fit well, roomier in the toe box than most shoes which is great and just the right amount of room lengthwise. They are tight getting them on and off, I have a somewhat narrow foot and high arches and it’s a struggle getting them on and off but I’m hoping they loosen up. I’m really hoping they will get softer and more comfortable with wear. They have a chemical smell which kind of adds to the low quality feeling and I’m trying to let them air out for a while before wearing them. Overall I like them but expected better because of all the hype and the price. I love the style of them and I’m hoping that breaking them in will make them my favorites shoes.",8
Sarah,Received the wrong size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28PVU9837QPTD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZ8I6OG,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 17, 2022",Size: 11.5 US Men / 13.5 US Women / 10.5 AUColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"Update: I reordered a size US 10 Womens/8 Mens and received a AUS 7, they fit perfect. I am always a US Womens 10 in boots, 10.5 in sneakers. I would not advise sizing up in width or length for women, since this is a unisex boot and pretty roomy, and the leather will stretch over time.  I believe this seller has both Australian (AUS) and US sizing listed. If the sizing has a Women’s size along with a Men’s size two sizes smaller (Womens 9, Men’s 7) - you’re ordering a US size. If the Women’s size and Mens size match (Womens 9, Men’s 9), its probably the AUS shoe size.  Past review: I ordered a Womens size 11.5, and I received boots size 10.5 AUS? It doesn’t make any sense, I should have been sent either the 11.5 that I ordered (by mistake), or a size 8.5 AUS (which is the equivalent to an 11.5 US). The antique brown is super cute, so I’ll be returning these and reordering the correct size!  FYI I would not recommend ordering half sizes (wide) for women. It is important to note that these 550 boots are unisex, meaning they are naturally wider to accommodate men’s feet. I am a female with average width feet, there was really no need to get a size wide in a unisex boot. I’m confident I can wear thick socks without the extra width. The boots are by no means slim, they’re rather chunky, so any extra width is going to make them look bulkier.",11

Another thing is about size tag, there is no size tag inside the shoes, but on the bottom of the shoes soles, it shows""10"". It is so confusing since I ordered size 11.",
