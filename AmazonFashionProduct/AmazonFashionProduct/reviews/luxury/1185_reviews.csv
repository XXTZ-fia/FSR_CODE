For reference I am 5'6"" & 215lbs.I ordered the XL. I still haven't decided if I will be keeping this set not due to quality but the top is very short for me almost a crop length and I am very long torso. The pants are so flattering with a wide leg and are the perfect length for me. The top is so cute and flattering but I can't lift my arms with out my stomach showing due to the length I wish it was just a bit longer.",
CarolynT,Super cute but not quite long enough,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBTHV8JKHUUY9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCNTSWPL,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"This set is super cute and great quality! Unfortunately, the pants are too short. I am 5’8”, 130-135 lbs. and they hit jus above my ankle. (Not flattering at all). Because i couldn’t find another set that was any longer, I let the hem out and added a double layer of additional fabrics with frayed edging to lengthen them and they turned out super cute! I wish they made pants for tall girls!!!  If you are over 5’6” these will likely be too short for you. The fabric drapes nicely and is not light or thin. The top is semi cropped, if I raise my arms my stomach shows, but it sits nicely at the waist with enough “blouse” to keep me covered and look stylish. I wear a tight tank underneath because I don’t like showing my midsection. But the tank doesn’t show unless I am reaching up. Great winter set! I’ll be wearing them on a ski trip and for winter travel. I would give 5 starts if they were longer :)",2

I love this set soooo much! It’s thick and soft and feels designer.  It looks like an expensive set for a fraction of the cost. The fit is true to size.  So warm and cozy.

I am 5'8, 133#.  the pants are high waisted and the waist band is too tight- very uncomfortable.  There is weird gathering at the waist band which makes the belly part of the pant ballon out. The pants were just long enough but I fear they will shrink when washed.  I will never know though because I am returning due to thin material and off fitting.The gray is a thicker material but still has the weird poofy gathering at the waist and the tight high waist band which is very uncomfortable.The top also has this cheap stark white lining that shows unless you zip it all the way up.  the white contrast of the lining against the dark gray is quite ugly imo.
