Of course the brand name bulks up the price but anyone would still except a clean dressing gown to arrive. Luckily I opened it prior and have had to brush off all the fluff/debris (hard red bits) and there’s a small stain next to the pocket.  Please check your stock before packaging.  Would of given high stars if there wasn’t the small stain and the effort of having to lint roll it as the dressing gown itself is soft and good quality,

Poor stitching & overall poor quality for the price. Thank god I opened it and lint rolled it as it was a Christmas present and I’d have been embarrassed on the day. Honestly seen better for an under £10 dressing gown. Shocking!,
