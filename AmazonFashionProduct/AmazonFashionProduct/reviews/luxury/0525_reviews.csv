Straight out of the box, they looked sleek, modern, and exactly like the product images online. The color combination is versatile, pairing effortlessly with joggers, jeans, or even a cute skirt. The corduroy detail adds a unique touch, and the overall craftsmanship is quality. Comfort-wise, these sneakers are great. They feel supportive without being too bulky. I’m excited to wear them more once the snow melts.  AS FOR SIZING, they fit true to size. I ordered my regular size, and it was spot-on.    In conclusion, these sneakers are a fantastic blend of style and functionality. They’ll quickly become my go-to shoes for casual outings. Highly recommend them for anyone looking for a reliable and fashionable pair of sneakers.",3
Moodie,2nd pair was clearly worn before I got them,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM38FGRL51DS7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D2THXKZQ,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: 8.5Color: White/Tan/Black,,"I typically wear a size 8-8.5 in women's shoes, and I found that these shoes run a tad bit smaller, as I had to return the size 8 for an 8.5. Both sizes styles were adorable, and I appreciated the stiffness of the shoe, which was comfortable and supportive.  The return process for the size 8 was very easy since I tried them free for 7 days before deciding to buy. However, I would rate the second pair I received (size 8.5) with only 1 star because they were damaged and of poor quality. It was clear that the shoes had been worn indoors, as the bottoms were relatively clean, but both shoes had small stains on the fabric, as shown in the pictures above. I tried to remove the stains, and while they became less noticeable, ultimately, they didn’t come out.  I was disappointed because this pair fit well, and I intended to keep them. I'm returning them for a third roll of the dice and ordering another size 8.5 in the same color and style, hoping they will arrive in new condition. I’ll update this review once I receive the third pair. Three strikes, you’re out! TBD…",
