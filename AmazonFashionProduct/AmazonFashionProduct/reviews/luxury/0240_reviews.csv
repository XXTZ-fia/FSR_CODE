There are two options as to how you can wear this shawl: fastening the attached clasp or pulling one end through the slit in the other.  This shawl is a little bigger than I had expected. It sits loose on the shoulders and comes down pretty far on the stomach.  The material is soft. In the brief time I had it out of the packaging, it didn't shed too much.",2

Listen to the directions!!!  After taking the stole out of its wrapping I put it on a no heat dryer cycle, then hung it up on a hanger.  A couple of days before the wedding I steamed the silk back and then used a blow dryer (cool setting) to fluff the fur (I fluffed in the opposite direction of the fur).  It looked wonderful and I received so many compliments!  Some of our guests even asked if it came with my dress (I purchased the white with coffee tips for myself).
