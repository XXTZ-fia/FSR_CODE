What happened to straps with buckles? They offer a much better fit not to mention they raise the style bar. I have narrow ankles and not a lot of muscle on my feet so being “adjustable” is misleading. They only adjust as far as the Velcro allows. I had to return these. Both straps at their tightest were too loose for my feet.,
