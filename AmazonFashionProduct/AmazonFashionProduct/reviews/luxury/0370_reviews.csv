A diagnoses of breast cancer is a bitter enough blow, but to lose your hair less than 3 weeks after starting Chemo Treatment, is just as hard to bare. I have been given 2 wigs, but to be honest, even after having them expertly cut by my own hairdresser, I feel more self conscious wearing them than I do a hat. And as the wigs I have are supplied by the NHS (I live in the UK)they are synthetic, thus itchy and hot and uncomfortable. So I have resorted to hats and caps. Scarves I do on occasion, but they are fiddly! This pre-tied scarf is soft and comfortable to wear, it keeps my head warm, as until you lose your hair, you do not realise how much it does actually insulate your head. But, even though it keeps my head warm, it does not make it feel over hot. The scarf comes with a lovely card with a delightful verse, beautifully wrapped in tissue paper. It is like receiving a gift. Such little touches, when you have been given such an earth shattering, body blow of a health diagnoses makes such a difference to your day. So much thought put in to the little things. I received this Head scarf at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review. it has not altered my opinion in any way.",2

I am so glad I got these! They are so, so soft, there isn't a tag or stitch out of place that would irritate delicate skin. A few days after I ordered them (but before they came) I was talking to the person who I got these for and she was saying she wanted one of these special hats she had read about...I recognized them as bamboo hats so this basket will be greatly appreciated.

I purchased it primarily because I ride a motorcycle and am always looking for a quality head wrap that can keep my hair from tangling into a million knots.  When I received the scarf I was more than pleased. It is super soft, but surprisingly durable. It is reinforced in the front with a band of several layers and rows of stitching, which is absolutely perfect for keeping it exactly where I put it while in the high winds on the motorcycle. When I felt the soft material I expected it to be difficult to keep in place to tie with all of my hair under it, but it stays in place nicely and because of the soft material doesn’t grab pieces of my hair in the knot. Also, it can be tied super tight or loosely and either way it stays in place and is super comfy.  I can see myself buying more of these. I’ve purchased many expensive, name brand head scarves and not a one is a great of quality as this one!!  Disclaimer: I purchased this head scarf at a discount in exchange for my review.

sandra k.,Not super impressed with this covering,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3G37V17OB3P0L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01BHUA8D0,"2.0 "," the United States "," February 24, 2016",,,"Not super impressed with this covering. It keeps coming undone, the know. It is very time consumming to have to keep tying it. Although it is comfotable to wear, the tying issue is why i gave it 2 stars. I tried to tye it tighter but then the top band part is too tight. I wish i could recommend this but i wont be able to! Thank you for making these products, it is appreciated but please take my concern into action and fix it!  thank you please note that i recieved this item at a discount for my honest review",2
Aja,SUCH GREAT QUALITY!!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2374UCRZR8T0F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01BHUA8D0,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 22, 2016",,,"I LOVE all the head coverings I have bought from this company so far!  Seriously, the material and stitching is such good quality!  It really seems like they care about their products and customers!  This cover is nice because it's like a bandana, but it has a lightly padded band in the front.  It's great for wearing around the house, or even under my scarves when I go out.  I really can't say enough good things about this company.  I tell my friends about them too because they are just straight quality.  Totally worth the price.  Love them!  I received this product at a discount for my honest opinion!",
