I have tried on the 3x, it was a little snug. I have been patiently waiting for a black with gold buttons and a khak8 with gold buttons to become available in my size. They have been out of my size for months now in these 2 colors. When are you going to come out with the black and khaki colored jackets with gold buttons in my size? I should also get a discount for having to wait so long. I love the coat. I don't like the wait or the size availability. You get less than 3 stars.",

There are two Navy colors so be sure to order the one you want. Look at the material description. The lining is silky and nice. I got the NAVY color (after ordering the mauve) and I love it!  Perfect with blue jeans or dress pants. I’m definitely ordering more colors. A blazer can take a blah outfit and turn it into a sharp attire and you can look put together quick!",22

First off, it’s important to note that the sizing is definitely off. 📏🧥 I usually wear an extra large, but this fits more or less like a large. If you decide to buy it, definitely consider sizing up! 📈  The color was also a bit of a surprise. 🎨👀 I was expecting a vibrant money green, but it turned out to be more of a very faded green. While it wasn’t what I anticipated, it’s still a nice shade and I’ve decided to make it work. 💁‍♀️👗  On the positive side, the material is decent and it’s well-constructed. ✂️👍 It’s a stylish piece and, even though it wasn’t exactly what I expected, I’ll still be wearing it and making it part of my wardrobe. 👠✨  Overall, a good purchase if you can adjust your expectations on size and color! ⭐⭐⭐",17
