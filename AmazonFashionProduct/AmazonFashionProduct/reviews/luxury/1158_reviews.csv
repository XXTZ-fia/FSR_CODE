Amazon User,New go to jeans,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QQ8IPUFC1EOX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHPFFLCS,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 1, 2024",Size: 28Color: Like a Charm,Verified Purchase,The wash is very flattering and they have just the right amount of stretch! Appreciate that they’re not super skinny so they’re much more flattering on bigger legs.,
Amazon Customer,My new fav jeans,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VW8WZ3NYKSAB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHPFFLCS,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 31, 2023",Size: 31Color: Life Rolls on,Verified Purchase,"My new favorite jeans. I love the fit, color looks lived in and hem is ragged which make me think they are well worn. I wear these everyday",
Lee,Beware curvy girls,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H0G4OYIW91GA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHPFFLCS,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 16, 2023",Size: 26Color: Double Agent,Verified Purchase,"I’m 5’4” 115-118lbs pear shape body. I carry my weight on the bottom. I ordered one size up, size 26 based on the reviews. My normal size is usually 25 if things run normal and 26 if things run small. The waist gaps and overall they are a tiny bit big. The problem is if I were to return them for a 25 I’m not sure if my backside would fit in the 25. In the size 26 my butt fits fine. The denim is not stretchy at all it’s pretty rigid. Typical issue for me the jeans gap in the waist and fit in the legs/backside in one size bigger, then when I go down a size the waist fits but the backside and legs are too tight. These gap worse than normal though in the waist. They aren’t really for curvy people. The rise is really high and the wash is nice. I wish they fit because they are cute and seem to be nice quality based on the thickness of material.",

Amazon Customer,"Luurve the photo print (""Throwback"")",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CMJQQW05PPJO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CHPFFLCS,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 3, 2022",Size: 25Color: Throwback,Verified Purchase,"I'm a sucker for unique prints, especially photo prints, as well as old-school nonstretch denim with a high rise.  This has it all!  The denim is very soft, and the print looks like a mountain hillside with some golden daisies.  It looks great with a gold sweater and a dark blue/green blazer that I already had.  I was also glad that the ""crop"" length wasn't too cropped -- almost full length on me (5'7"" but with long torso and short legs).  Although some others said these were too small, I thought they were true to size -- you just have to factor in that the waist is actually at or near the waist and the denim does not have stretch.",

These definitely did not look like how they are pictured!,2

The material is stiff, old school denim. No stretch here so order your size carefully. I wear a 27 usually because I have full hips/butt, but my waist is small. The 27 does gap about 2 inches at the small of my back. But with no stretch, there's no way the booty is fitting into a 26. Still cute though and great for casual days.",

The style is very cute, love the unique destruction, but the fit is so odd: Looser in the thighs, very tight in the hips, and loose again in the waist. Just odd. They are a thick denim (100% cotton), so the extra room in the upper thighs is not flattering, sadly. Ordered size 24. Three stars for unique style.",

Non-high end brand still got its own standard and quality in details and this is not it!!  If you only want a jean, this is not bad choice but you can probably find it in target for much cheaper price. But if you want this brand, I dont recommend this one.",3
