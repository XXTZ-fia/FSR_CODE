All photos don't do its justice. With that said. From the fabric, to comfort and size. It's perfect. Sure, you can go to a higher brand label. But not everyone wants to spend over $500 to $5000 just for a blazer.  Coofandy does an excellent velour/velvet blazer for men. I'm 6ft tall, 20inch biceps, between athletic/sticky broad shoulder build. Got this in a XXL. It fits just right. Not much room in the bicep/lat area. So even a XXXL will fit me. Don't get me wrong, I still have some room in this and it does have some stretch. Pretty forgiving fabric. I like that the shoulders have some padding as well. This will keep you blazer in much better shape when hanging it with a proper blazer/coat hanger. All in all, absolutely love it. Can't beat the price and shipped fast. Don't listen to the negative reviews. The blazer is legit and as good as it gets at the price. If you want a Gucci, Armani and so forth. Then seek out those companies. And good luck paying under $100.00 for a velour Gucci blazer. It also came with couple extra buttons and all pockets are functional. Thanks! 😎",
