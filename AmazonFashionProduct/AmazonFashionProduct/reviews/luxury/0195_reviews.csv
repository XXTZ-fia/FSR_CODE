Preston,"Hard bristles, comfortable grip, good quality",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBWT8CFCQ4B39/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CZ3WR564,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 21, 2024",,,"Hard bristles, comfortable grip, good quality:  These brushes come with stiff bristles that are very good ac scrubbing in a vertical motion. The bristles are a good bit firmer than other similar units I own, and allow you to really get a tougher areas clean with less effort. The bristles are very thin though and don't work as well for a side to side clean, and are better suited for smaller, acute areas where there's a buildup of gunk that needs to be removed. The grip on the brushes is very comfortable and relatively ergonomic, making it easier to hold onto when your hands are wet and lets you use more force when scrubbing. The quality of the brushes is pretty good given the low ~$9 cost of the set, and since it comes with three you can use one while the other is dirty or being cleaned.  Overall, this is a good set and I would recommend.",3

I reuse as many bottles as I can, and these brushes with the stiff metal spine make it easy to really clean inside.

I put one of these with the cleaning supplies, one in the garden (cleaning out pots) and one in with the car wash for wheels etc. This set of three is an amazing value! I will get a few more sets to give to family.",2
