John-Frazier,Pretty good quality. I would purchase again it again.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMHI8F70HYQD1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRKL8D2,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 14, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"It’s not my favorite pillowcase that I’ve purchased on Amazon, but I like the print with the cheetah, and it was made well. The zipper is a good quality. The fabric feels like a heavy polyester blend, and if you’re looking for a soft pillowcase this is not the one to go with—the texture is a heavy weave. Overall, I’m happy, and I would repurchase.",
MKF,Really nice!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20YQ91X9TGYSI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRKL8D2,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 19, 2024",,Verified Purchase,These are a winner. The fabric is a very nice quality and they look great.,
Victoria G,My new favorite throw pillow,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7ED9H4ANBX26/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRKL8D2,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 1, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I had been searching for a jaguar/ leopard print throw pillow, but everything looked cheap or too colorful. Love that this pillow case is more muted with the colors and background pattern- makes it super versatile to pair with other pillows and throw blankets.  The fabric is pretty soft and washes well. The chair it’s perched on doesn’t really get used much, so can’t vouch much for durability.",
Andrea Hogle,As pictured!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C2WYVMTM2B55/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRKL8D2,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 28, 2023",,Verified Purchase,Great quality! I’m very happy with this purchase. I over filled it and it looks great on my sofa!,5
