Fallon O'Hagan,Gorgeous!! (Need pockets though),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RPIL4FAQHI0F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWXPZW6K,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 27, 2025",Size: One SizeColor: Night Flowers,,"Absolutely love this robe!! I almost got the pink one, but I changed my mind to the Night Flowers color at the last second, and I’m so glad I did! It’s gorgeous, and unique. It’s so satiny smooth, I’ve even fallen asleep in it a few times. I was at a hotel the other day with my family, and I was using it as a cover up for the pool, and I went to go out front to take a call, and my husband goes: “You’re really going to go outside in THAT?” I said: “Heck yeah, I look fancy af!” 😆 I wanted to take a star off for it not having pockets, because it IS annoying that it doesn’t have pockets, but I love it so much, it doesn’t feel right to give it anything less than 5. I’m most likely going to get it in the black and pink as well. :)",

Mary S.,Nice print but sizing is a bit off,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXDUDZR3MIZJN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWXPZW6K,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 29, 2024",Size: One SizeColor: Teal Birds,Verified Purchase,"I bought this for use as a travel robe.  I loved the print and color, for one.  Secondly, the sizing is a bit off for me.  I'm 5'2"" and the length is actually fine.  That's the normal issue for me -- well-fitting lengths.  In this case, it's the fact that the robe keeps opening up, and I have to keep retying it multiple times.  There is an inside tie, and I have used it as well as the outside tie.  It just keeps falling open.  I wear XL P or 1X P size, so if you are larger than that it might stay closed on you.  I think it's prob. just too big on me. However, the price is right, and it was a risk which I was wiling to take.  I wish I could leave it a 5 star, but the fit...one size does not fit all.  Since I just intended to use it for travel, it will be sufficient.  It's possible I could have it altered, but I didn't want to incur an additional costs on it.  I haven't washed it yet, and doubt it will shrink much.  Very pretty though.",

I went with the dark green one with the white flowers and cranes and it’s really subtle and beautiful. I might even order another one just to rotate. I have my eye on that bright red one as well.  My biggest complaint is that there’s no loop to hang this by. That seems like such a silly oversight. I don’t like hanging any clothing on hooks by the material itself, and especially not in the case of something silky like this. For the time being, I’ve been draping the entire robe over the hook so as not to stress the fabric or damage it at all and who knows, maybe that’s just what I’ll have to do forever. Not a huge deal, but it’s the biggest reason I’m not rating this 5 stars.  Be aware that the material is extremely silky, which is great, but that means it doesn’t grip well, so you’ll need to use the inside tie to keep things in place. You’ll also need to either double knot the sash or pull it very tight to keep it from slipping. That’s just the nature of this type of material.  It’s a lovely robe. If only they’d put a loop so I could hang it up, I’d have given it a 5/5.  Edit to add: I went to a tailor and they were happy to add a loop to the robe. It was easy and $10 and you can’t even tell from the other side. Whenever I decide to order a second one, I’ll go and ask the tailor to add a loop to that one as well (yeah, I love the robe enough that I’ll order a second one, even though I still think this company deserves the biggest eye roll for leaving that out).",5

The ties and slash come undone almost immediately even when double knotted, neither the belt slash nor the inner ties hold their bow or knot for more than just a few minutes.  They won’t stay tied!  Doubled,  knotted or bowed.  Very frustrating.  I will now have to sew on snaps, and sew the belt slash onto the robe.  I love the look and feel of the fabric, so I am not returning it.  I just think the manufacturer could have made this robe better.  A wardrobe malfunction will happen after a few minutes of wear!  Buyer beware!",4
