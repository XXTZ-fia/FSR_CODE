Lobogirl71,Great sweater and pant set!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20G1CQ4V2V8KI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CDGYSNC9,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 26, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,,"I got this as a gift for my mom who dresses for comfort over everything else and this was a perfect set for her! Both pieces are out of the same knit and are great quality for the price! When I gave them to her yesterday for Christmas she immediately put on the set and was so happy with them! She usually washes everything before wearing them, but she just couldn't resist with how soft the set is and the quality.  It fit as expected on her. I ordered an XL set for her and she's a US XL. The sweater looked ""boxy"" in the product images, so I guessed correctly that it would be a bit roomy for wearing another thin shirt under for extra warmth. The weight of the knit is similar to more expensive resort knits you find at nice departments stores here in the US and it hangs beautifully even with the more roomy size of it. I think you could definitely size down on this if you wanted it to be a bit more fitted and it would skim the body just based on how my mom's true size fit her.  It does say hand wash only on the product listing, but to be honest my mom will probably wash it on gentle in the machine, in cold water, and in an oversized lingerie bag. Based on our experience with fabric blends that include viscose, you should be able to wash it that way with good results. I've honestly never had this method fail for me, but our machine's (my mom lives with me) gentle cycle is very gentle. If for any reason our washing method doesn't work, I will update this post and most certainly not find fault with the manufacturer for my straying from their recommendation. If you choose to wash it this way as well, please only do so if you know that your machine does truly wash things very gently and only on cold and in a lingerie bag. I would never, ever wash a knit like this ""loose"" in a machine as it will definitely get caught on something and be damaged...when in doubt wash my hand with no jewelry on or while wearing rubber gloves to protect the knit.",

Mae T.,Casual elegance,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG4XXQ0W35LQ3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CDGYSNC9,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 23, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Grey,,"When I see ""wide legs"" in a pants listing, I think palazzo-pants wide, and more often than not when the pants arrive, that is not the case. If I'm lucky, the pants leg are comfortably relaxed, and that is the case with the pants in this outfit.  That said, I really like this two-piece casually-elegant knit pant set. I got the set in grey & cream color, size L. The material is a tight knit with a rather stiff stretch that retains it's shape when stretched. The tunic-length top in a soft cream color with muted but rich-looking gray horizontal details and side slits at the hem. It is just the right length to look elegant while helping to cover any mid-section shortcoming you may want to minimize. The pants have a comfortable-elasticized, moderately-wide waistband, and are just the right length for the average height woman (I'm somewhere between 5'6"" and 5'7"") to wear with flat shoes or high heels.  The medium-heavyweight of the material definitely makes this a cold weather outfit of the kind you might wear to an outside evening event. My only small complaint is the ribbed mock turtle neckline: I would have preferred something a bit more upscale like maybe a collared scoop, V or boatneck. But then again, the set is described as a lounge set which some take to mean casual, so I guess that fits.  So if you're not looking for palazzo pants wide legs and don't mind a ribbed mock turtleneck neckline, Buy true to size and enjoy this elegantly-casual two-piece pants set.",5

Overall, really nice.  I'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs and ordered a Medium. Fit is great for everything except the length of the pants. The length of the legs are probably best for someone around 5'7"" or 5'8"". The length of the sleeves on the top are good, though, so not sure if that would end up being an issue. The leg openings aren't the type you can easily hem but I might see what can be done. In the meantime, rolling up the waistband once seems to be ok.  The quality is a good value, so I still recommend, but just note the legs on the pants may be a little long if you're under 5'6"".",5
