fastpatch68,a bit on the thinner side,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IMEZD1L0T84F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSYXW54W,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 21, 2025",Size: Large-X-LargeColor: Pink / Striped,,"The Vi’Cotton Hooded Robe has a lovely color and design, and I appreciate that it’s made from real cotton. However, the material is on the thinner side, which makes it less effective as a bathrobe. I was hoping for something more absorbent, like the classic towel material that dries you off efficiently after a shower. The hood is a stylish touch and adds to the overall look of the robe, but I find it doesn’t serve much of a functional purpose as a bathrobe. While it’s soft and lightweight, it feels more like a loungewear piece than a practical bathrobe. If you’re looking for a robe for drying off, this might not be the best choice, but it could work well as a cozy layer for relaxing around the house.",

It’s beautiful and even though I’m modeling it in image, I got it for my husband. The robe he currently has is a super thick terry cloth. It’s great, but It’s super hot and humid here in south Fl and a lightweight breathable robe is a good thing to have. This is certainly both of those, but it’s not flimsy. The fiber content has a nice substantial weight to it. I ordered this in the largest size, L-XL. I’m holding it closed in image because I can’t locate the belt (it’s around here somewhere). It did fold over and close well, but not as oversized as expected. Thankfully my husband’s hips are much slimmer than mine. For reference, I’m 5’5,” 165lbs and my hips are 44.” The quality of construction is top notch and I love that it’s hooded. I chose this in the Gray shade and it’s exact to the product’s image. I felt out of all the color selections, this was the most unisex or masculine. But - I’d be thrilled if this gray shade were available in one size larger, I’d happily buy and wear it.",

I gave it to her, who is lean built at ~5'8"" and it's high/mid-thigh on her.  I'd guess the model they used for their pictures is a petite ~5'5"" in a Large-X-Large, and that's where the sleeves and bottom fall on her. Fair enough - the material is comfy and light and feels like a luxury spa type robe, so that's good, but just be aware what size to expect before buying.",
Customer Review,"Wonderful 100% Turkish cotton, but size L/XL is way off",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TIGZ3EYXI6G5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CSYXW54W,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 20, 2024",Size: Large-X-LargeColor: Green / Patterned,,"I received the bathrobe in the Green Patterned in size L/XL.  I have a Turkish cotton towel that I love, so I thought I would try this bathrobe. This bathrobe is the same wonderful, soft, 100% cotton material as my towel. It is not fluffy like some other bathrobes, but it is super cozy and not nearly as bulky.  I am normally a Woman’s size Small, and sometimes order a Medium for extra room. Having read some other reviews, I thought a size L/XL would be my best bet. The L/XL fits just about right on me and is not too big. I would say the L/XL that I received fits more like a Woman’s size S.  The washing instructions say that you are not supposed to put this in the dryer.  The robe I received has a few pulls in it, but they are small.  The belt tie is removable (it is not sewn on). This robe also has two exterior pockets.  PROS: * 100% Cotton made in Turkey * Has pockets * Not bulky  CONS: **** The L/XL is more like a Woman’s size S. * Not supposed to put in the dryer * The robe I received has a few tiny pulls  NEUTRAL: * I would not describe this material as “Fleece”, as indicated in the title. I think the seller should remove “Fleece” from the description to avoid confusion.",

Unfortunately, as pointed out by other reviewers, this robe does run a little small. I ordered the L-XL size, and while it fits it's not quite large enough to give you that full body hug you really want from a robe. If you want that you should size up.

I know that buying clothes without trying them on can be a hit or miss proposition, but still, there are certain standards with regards to size that I've come to rely on. This bathrobe is WAY outside of those standards. I'm not a small guy, but while my most comfortable size is XXL, I have lots of sweatshirts that are XL. While those are a bit snug, they still fit OK. This was purported to be Man or Woman Size L - XL. When I tried to put it on for the first time I would get one arm in but then as I reached for the other arm behind my back I couldn't find it. I actually thought that maybe it was fastened together in the back to make it smaller for shipping, but it wasn't. When I finally got both arms in it I couldn't pull the front anywhere close to getting the thing to meet together in front. There was a good 12 inch gap between lapels. A robe is supposed to come together in front and be fastened using a tie so that it provides an amount of coverage in case you have little or nothing on underneath. But this one doesn't cover my chest at all.  To verify that it wasn't just me, I asked my wife (size M) to try it on and even for her it just barely came together in the front. I double checked the size on the lapel and it was definitely a L-XL. In addition to that, the material, while soft, was incredibly thin. You can see light through it. When I first looked at the picture of it and read the description, for some reason I envisioned one of those thick luxurious robes you sometimes find in the closets at high end hotels. That may be my problem with incorrect expectations, but this is thinner than my most tattered t-shirts. Not at all what I want from a robe.",

I ordered a larger one, and it's nice and roomy, like I like my clothing if I'm forced to wear clothing (and the laws seem to think I do, plus no need to scare the neighbors).  The hood - kind of wondered about that, too, but it's great for passively wicking moisture from a head full of extensions and more (which you don't need to be rubbing if you want your extensions to last).  Air dries itself very nicely after it air dries you.  Mine arrived without any outer wrap, so be sure to check the right selection box if you want it covered up for delivery (such as a gift).  Would make a great gift, but I'll have to order a 2nd one to gift, because mama's keeping this one! LOVE IT!",2

I will hang it in my guest room so my skinnier friends can be happy when they come and visit! I will also note the sleeves are a short three-quarter length. I am tall, but they still feel shorter than a normal three-quarter length rope does. This may or may not bother you. I also feel the belt loops are maybe a little high, but I am tall, so maybe that is why I feel that way. All that said, it is a nice robe, I just can’t wear it.
