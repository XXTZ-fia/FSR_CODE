I have seen a sweater very similar to this at Talbots with a price tag of over $90.  The material of this sweater is incredibly soft and stylish. I didn’t want to take it off when I got home from teaching all day. The bright gold buttons have a kings crown engraved on them.  The pockets are challenging to see in the photograph unless you enlarge it; however, they are just the right size for lipstick and a set of keys if you prefer to place those items inside.  I received numerous compliments from both teachers and students.  I saw this truly identical sweater a few weeks ago and put it in my Amazon cart at a price of $49.55. A few days later, I found the exact same sweater and the only difference was the tag brand inside the sweater. I placed this one in my cart and it was actually on sale for $20. I have noticed the price has gone up $4-5 so far. Even with that price tag, this sweater is an incredible steal.  The size is perfect for me. I wish another color was in stock at the same time when I purchased this one, and then I would have bought two.  I washed it on a delicate cycle, dried for 10 minutes with a couple of other delicate clothing items, and then hung it to completely dry. I do not want to take a chance of getting fuzz balls on this incredibly classy piece of clothing. If I could give this sweater 10 stars, I definitely would not hesitate!",11

The color is a little more pinkish than the j crew version but let me tell you… THIS is the winner! It’s a couple inches longer, which I appreciate as I’m 5’8”, size 12-14, 40DD. The Large is comparable to the XL J crew. It’s SO SOFT and a fraction of the price. Does run a size big, as other reviews stated. I actually think the fit on this one is more flattering than the expensive one. It’s  more comfortable and not so thick and stiff but still looks nice, not sloppy or too unstructured (unless you order your regular size or size up). Came back to order the black and maybe the striped one too. Love!",11
