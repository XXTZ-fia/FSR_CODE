I no longer wake up sweating or freezing - it's just right. Construction is top-notch: no feathers poking through, even after 2 months of use. The king size (106""x90"") actually hangs properly over the sides of the bed unlike cheaper options that shrink up. Comes neatly packaged and fluffs up beautifully after a few hours.  One word of caution: You may be late to work because leaving this heavenly cocoon in the morning is HARD. But hey, that's a price I'm willing to pay for the best sleep of my life.

I got the King size for my King bed. However, I almost wish I had gotten the Oversized King or Super King size instead.

The thickness is perfect for summer. It keeps me warm enough without forcing me to overheat while sleeping. It will be interesting to see if I feel the same about the duvet in the winter or if we’ll need an extra layer of blankets.  I did get a cover for this duvet because our household has a lot of animals. Between the cover and the duvet’s innate durability, we are still holding strong with the duvet in near perfect condition still.  I’m not so in love with this duvet that I would pay over $200 for it. Personally, I’m not one to spend a lot of money on blankets or duvets. I am happy as long as I am warm.  Overall, I am very pleased with this duvet!!",

I have some down duvet inserts that are 1 & 2 years old and they both still have some lingering down odor to them. My duvets are purely decorative, I don’t sleep under them (my husband and I sleep with separate blankets and fold the comforter down on the bed each night), so I can’t say how warm it is.  The baffling isn’t very distinct which is normal for most lightweight duvet inserts. The duvet itself is rather flat compared to other’s I have. I don’t necessarily mind this. Sometimes you don’t necessarily want the baffling to be prominent. But it’s something to consider.  I have a nearly identical oversized king duvet from a different amazon company. It’s a light weight where is this is a medium weight. Comparing that light one to this medium weight one, the other brand is cheaper. And where mine is a light weight, and this is a medium weight, the baffling on my light weight other brand duvet is more prominent. So I do think the price is a little steep considering what you’re getting. And it this seems more lightweight than my other one that is rated as lightweight.

The product stats on the webpage states a 60% Cotton and 40% Polyester Fabric Type ratio.  The material don't get me wrong is fluffy and sumptuously soft and smooth. Unlike most present-era comforters sold at retail that are flat as a door knob. This one from DWR is way better than the rest of their competitors and the luxury price point reinforces that posture.  The comforter comes vacuum sealed wrap as presented in their retail box as showcased above in the 1st picture. (left to right order.) The final 5th picture is my queen-sized bed and how it spreads out evenly for full coverage. I didn't locate any loose threads nor any product brand new cloth fuzz on the comforter which is a feat in itself for textiles. All seams were sewn correctly and the comforter seems to have a venting mechanism if you need to squeeze air out of it to flatten it out for later storage. Finally, at the very top center of the comforter, there is a convenient loop notch to hang the comforter on a cloth line or elsewhere for drying purposes.  This product comes from the Hangzhou region of China which is one of its major textile industry hubs nationally. I did notice a typo on one of the merchant webpage product graphics. The one that states ""Wrap Yourself in Luxury"" from the 2nd icon on the left states ""Could-Like Fluffy"" versus ""Cloud-Like Fluffy"" something to correct later on for marketing purposes.",6

It comes vacuum sealed and when I took the photos (18 hours after removing it from the vacuum bag), there were some very noticeable wrinkles, but I think those will get much less noticeable as the down fills up and decompresses more. I found a few threads that needed to be cut off of the comforter along the edges, but none of them would harm the integrity of the comforter.  There is a silver edge all around the comforter which I don't really like, but that is my own taste.  Overall, this is a very nice down comforter and I can't wait to use it this coming winter.",

Flat, lightweight, cheap quality with loose threads everywhere. Definitely not worth $145. Would not buy this again, would not recommend to anyone.",7

However not as warm as I expected  More like a medium weight than a heavy one. I have to cover it with a blanket on colder nights.,

salapao,SUPER fluffy and warm quiet (noiseless) comforter,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AU3P4BNVLJKT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DRY1P4Q2,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 2, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"I bought a twin sized, heavy weight white comforter and it was beyond my expectations. I wanted a warm and soft comforter that won’t make noise when i toss and turn and this is exactly what i wanted (although it sounds loud in my attached video, I promise you in real life it’s noiseless). This is my first time buying a comforter and buying anything from Amazon so of course i was skeptical about the reviews saying that it was fluffy. However, once i got it out of the bag, unfolded it and let it sit for about an hour or more it fluffs up like in the video i attached. I didn’t know comforters can be that fluffy (but then again i got the heavy weight one). It’s almost as fluffy as my pillow?!  I didn’t even wash it or put it in the dryer. Over all, i am in love with my purchase and i dont wanna get out of bed. Buy it and if the correct product arrives, u wont regret it. (Mine came in a small cardboard box with illustrations of trees on it. the comforter is vacuum packed in a plastic bag inside the box)",96
