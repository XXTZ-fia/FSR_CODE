Chris Kent,I went up one size. I'm usually lg to XL,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F6Z3E951JJ9T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01E8BWUA4,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 19, 2023",,Verified Purchase,As I had read ...I went up a size or two. Ignore the comments about bad quality of material and such.  This suit is what it is.  It's more theatrical than practical.  But in that... I think it's a well made suit.  For $90 I got a 3pc with white gloves and a bow tie.  I will have my fiance do a bit of seamstress work magic. But any place could do wonders with this for about $60. I just spent $1000 for a Ralph Lauren with sizing.  Sooo consider this a savings.  This suit will have a better impact when I perform my Spanish sets of music.  Good suit for occasional impact statement or theater.  I think it will last well. I'm pleased with the fit and finish both.,

In my case when I received my set of clothing, they sent the Jacket, but the vest and pants were missing. Must have been an error in the warehouse. I contacted the seller and they were very professional and determined to find a solution or give compensation. Since I only received the Jacket, they gave me a $40.00 partial refund. I think that is really FAIR and GREAT on their part! So, the 5 stars is mostly for the integrity of the customer service person who assisted me. Top-Notch customer service! You can order fearlessly from ""CloudStyle"" because if there is a problem with your order, then you can bet your bottom dollar the customer service department will make it right!  SIZING, I have learned from other reviews that the garment is just too small. But, I wear a Medium, and I took a chance and ordered my suit in an Extra-Large, and this size fits me perfectly. So, try ordering your suit 2 sizes larger and it may be perfect for you too (God Willing).",5
