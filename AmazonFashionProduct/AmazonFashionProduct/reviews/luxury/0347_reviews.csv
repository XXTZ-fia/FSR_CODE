They were so tight when they were brand new! Another thing was that the raw hem kept getting more ""stringy"" with repeated wearing. I was pretty gentle with these shorts and ALWAYS washed and partially dried them in a lingerie bag, so the threads that kept coming off the hem of the shorts was surprising and not in a good way. I still love the shorts and now that the price has dropped from $98.00 to literally under $20, I may even buy them again in a smaller size. In retrospect I don't see them worth more than $30 for the quality of the fabric. ---- The crochet style sunflowers in these shorts are perfect! The quality of the embroidery is exceptional. They do not look cheap and if washed in a lingerie bag I believe these will be just fine in the laundry. I tried these in in a major department store in a size 30 and could barely breathe. I found them here on Amazon in a size 31 (and $12 less than retail price, thank you!) and they fit perfectly. FYI my usual size is a 31, I was just worried because the 30 felt ridiculously small. They arrived super fast, too.",
