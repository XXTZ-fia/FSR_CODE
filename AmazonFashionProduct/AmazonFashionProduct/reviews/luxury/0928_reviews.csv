What is surprising is how heavy they are weight-wise, which is suspect is due to the extra fabric with the ribbing. I’m talking seriously heavy. The bell bottoms are much wider than the picture and they are a bit longer than is typical for this type of pants. Since the hem is finished with a knit edge, shortening them isn’t feasible. I’m 5’4” and they’d be better for someone about 3” taller. Still a good choice for casual pants that don’t look like sweatpants.",
