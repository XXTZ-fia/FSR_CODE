The zipper up the back works well without creating issues for my feet, my (high) arches feel supported, and the strap does not rub. I purchased according to my EU size, which was true to size, although normally my US size would have indicated I get a size smaller. So if you know your EU size, I would go with that.

However, they only had 6.5 and the recommendation caveat based on my previous buys suggested it would do. I expected it to fit a big snug but instead it was still too big for my already very wide foot. Long story short, they run large in my experience. The overall feel of the shoe is cheap, the toe box indents easily and would likely not fully recover. it's simply a great costume option but if you're going for yellow it seems like a mixed bag with this company gauging by the other reviews and pictures. I was also in need of a light soft yellow but instead mine were more lemony with a tint of green. Not as yellow as the mustard picture in the reviews. There's a review picture of the color I was hoping for but again, I think they have various shades of yellow and there's no telling which you'll receive.",

These shoes were in the sun for about 10 minutes before I brought them in and the smell was gag-inducing - more like rotten meat than any chemicals. The zippers up the heel are a cute idea but they're on a short, unsupported curve. They don't unzip. If you manage to work it down with the use of 3 to 4 hands you don't have, it doesn't zip back up. I wear an 8.5 and ordered a 9, and when I did finally manage to get my foot in post-zipper fiasco, the shoe was significantly too short and not wide enough - the elastic holding the front band was stretched to the max. Also, the material is not as cleanly-colored as in the photo. The shoes look like blue material buffed over with matte black shoe polish. I don't know why clothing on Amazon is a hotbed of not-like-the-photo sizing nightmares, and I shouldn't be surprised but this was especially abysmal.
