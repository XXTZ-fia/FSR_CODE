Dori Lee O.,Pretty but not at all purple...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPKC5A76N4AWK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHQKMHRL,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 17, 2024",Size: 12-13mmColor: Three CZ,,"Hey Everyone, Dori here. I absolutely love pearls. But I was really expecting this one to be purple like in the ad. It's rather on the brownish pinkish side. That's why I gave 4 stars. It is still a beautiful necklace and can be worn with anything. Fits nice made well. Worth it, recommended.",

Eranikus,"Lovely pearl, does not feel genuine",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DWPBICENCXG4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHQKMHRL,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 3, 2024",Size: 11-12mmColor: V Style,,"Pendant arrives in a very nice gift box with seller name embossed on lid. The chain holding the pearl is a box style with a small claw-style clasp, a bit slippery to maneuver so I used the edge of a fingernail to grasp it. There was a very strong chemical odor when I first opened the box. It has dissipated now but was very noticeable. The pearl itself is large with a lovely luster. Color is a combination of pink, lavender and grey. I ran the pearl across the biting edge of my teeth and it feels smooth, not gritty. Not entirely certain this is a genuine pearl, cultured or not.",
Sarah,Very pretty,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3248E0XWINK7H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHQKMHRL,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 23, 2024",Size: 12-13mmColor: Three CZ,,"This necklace is beautiful. The pearl is large and smooth, kind of a rose gold color. I was hoping for more of a pink or purple, but I understand natural variations happen. The chain is delicate but sturdy, and it's a good length. For less than $100, I'm very pleased.",

Their  pearls  are large, lustrous and of high quality. Their prices are unbelievably low for what you get, allowing you to really buy a lot! The Edison Pearl is large, lustrous, and has hints of color that are just too beautiful to describe! Thanks to Amazon, you get their jewelry fast. Presentation boxes are just lovely. This is truly one of my favorite stores.",2

BuzzyQBee,light lavender pearl,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGJO92NKHPTTA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHQKMHRL,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 31, 2024",Size: 11-12mmColor: V Style,,Not as purple as what's shown on its Amazon product photos. Mine's more of of a grayish lavender. And the V-style of the cubic zirconia holder of the pearl pendant looks more like parallel lines than a V. Still pretty though. Like the round cultured pearl. It's size makes it more visible. Also like the sterling silver base of this whole necklace and my strong magnet test seems to confirm that. It's not a fancy pearl necklace so won't look out of place when worn with shirt and jeans or leggings.  Recommended.,2

So really bummed about this. Just be aware that the color in the photo may not be what you are getting.,

Nimue,"Lustrous Pearl, Gorgeous Pendant",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GDIJQCC8CUU3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHQKMHRL,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 8, 2023",Size: 12-13mmColor: Classic,,"Pearls are my birthstone, and I have a decent collection in my jewellery cabinet: everything from naturally coloured freshwaters and a classic akoya choker to dyed Honora sets and exquisite Aurora Hanadamas.  This is, however, my first Edison.The ""purple"" is definitely more of a lavender, but it is beautiful, and the colour changes slightly depending both on the light and the fabric against which the pearl is resting.  There are one or two minute-but-visible blemishes, but the surface is largely clean and the pearl is almost perfectly round and the size advertised.  It's not as metallic as some Edison pearls, but exhibits remarkable lustre and a gemmy shine.  It is set in sterling that is marked as S925, with a lovely single cz stone above the pearl.  The pendant comes on surprisingly strong and sturdy sterling box chain and is packaged in an elegant box.I am impressed enough with this pendant to be excited at the thought of ordering more from this company, and I very much recommend them to anyone who appreciates quality pearls.",
Texas Rose,Very Beautiful Lustrous Pearl,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8CZMR0YCAFN1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHQKMHRL,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 27, 2023",Size: 12-13mmColor: Three CZ,,"I like the overall simplicity of the necklace. The sterling silver box chain is very delicate; three distinct ""diamonds"" descending in size lead to the main event of the piece - the large solitary round pearl which needs no further adornment.  I chose the larger pearl and I'm glad I did, but the ""diamonds"" make the necklace more suitable for dressy clothes. It's really pretty and needs to be featured against skin or fine textured fabric.  The pearl is beautiful in size, shape and luster. The color changes a bit depending on the light and background. The one I received is very pale purple - definitely not eggplant. Purple clothing brought out the purple in the pearl.  The clasp and chain are so delicate I had a little challenge connecting them even holding the piece in front of me to put it away. I'll probably need help putting it on because the closure and chain links are so tiny. There is no larger jump ring to catch.  Included in the gift box was a soft polishing cloth to keep the silver chain bright. So nice.  It's a beautiful necklace and I'll feel special when I wear it.",2
