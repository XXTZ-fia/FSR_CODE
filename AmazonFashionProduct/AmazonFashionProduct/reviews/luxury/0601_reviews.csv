Caiti,"A Statement, but Runs Small",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHRHSH8KETDWI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF26C5W3,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 29, 2022",,,"With an all over floral design and a contrasting embroidered shawl collar, this tuxedo jacket is in one word... EXTRA. It is for the man who wants to make an entrance with all eyes on him.  The outer shell features a colorful satin sheen finish, a chest pocket, two front flap pockets, a single button closure, a back vent and 4 non-working buttons on the each sleeve. The inside is fully lined in a black matte finish and two inside piped pockets at the chest. Shoulder pads built into the lining are there to maintain structure.  It looks and feels like nice quality, but the size chart is not accurate. The XXL is stated as having a chest size of 53.5 inches in the size chart. I had my husband, who is a 52 Long jacket size, try it on for size and he was unable to button it. It looked good in torso length and sleeve length was spot on, but he said that it fit like a 48 or 50 around his chest.  Personally, as a woman, I found this jacket to be really attractive. Since it doesn't fit my husband, I am considering having it tailored to fit me.  100% polyester- hand wash and drip dry or dry clean only.",
