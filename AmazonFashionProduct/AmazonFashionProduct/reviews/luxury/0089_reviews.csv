bobthecamper,Nicer than you'd think,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VPXD3GCD1Y05/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08HCTQC91,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 29, 2023",Size: 10.5Color: Silver,Verified Purchase,"I loved this ring.  When I received it I was amazed at the quality and the classiness of it.  Usually the pictures of jewelry are much nicer than the actual pieces (more on that to come).  This ring actually looked nicer than the pictures, and it was really solid and even a bit weighty.  I was very happy with it.  Then I lost it.Soon after, I was browsing one of the cheapie import sites that sells a ton of cheap everything and you often find yourself Wishing you'd gotten something better... and I found a bunch of ring listings that looked just like this ring.  And I thought - why on earth would I pay what I paid for that ring when I can get the same thing for 1/10th of the price?  So I bought one.  It's not the same ring.  Not even close.  Same basic design, but that's it.  The materials are thinner and cheaper (and not tungsten).  I won't say the new ring looks bad, but it's just not the same and lacks any wow factor.  It looks cheap.  So in this case it's true that you get what you pay for.  This: a very nice, high-quality ring you'll be proud to wear.  That: um... not so much.",
