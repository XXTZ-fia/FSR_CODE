Hermione G.,Fabrication error,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1F4MAR96YS5OH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN6G9ZHP,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 25, 2024",,,"This is actually a really nice piece, with one notable exception that I'll get to in a minute. The pearl is real, sized as advertised, and has a really nice finish - better than expected, even under magnification. The black is actually a dark gray with good color overtones, leaning blue as in the picture, but there will be some amount of color variation in any natural product. The chain is as described, stamped 925 on pendant and chain both, and nothing reacts to a magnet other than the lobster clasp, and that's normal and expected since the inner spring there should not be made of sterling.  The join where the bail meets the pearl is a problem. This is likely drilled and glued, like a little tiny silver dowel goes down into the drill hole and gets glued in place. There's some glue leak that didn't get caught in time, and that's something that should have been caught in quality control - and should happen very rarely to begin with.  They also just... don't mention the clear stones. I assume they're crystal or glass, since they'd want to mention cubic zirconia precisely so that buyers do NOT assume the cheapest available materials.",2
Top Reviewer,Gorgeous Black Pearl Pendant,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23L64R0D8GPGE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN6G9ZHP,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 18, 2024",,,"This is a gorgeous black pearl necklace with a touch of CZ icing on the pendant. The necklace came with a thick chain that is slightly adjustable. The pearl has a nice iridescence to it and was fairly round. The necklace came in a large blue necklace box, great for gifting!",
