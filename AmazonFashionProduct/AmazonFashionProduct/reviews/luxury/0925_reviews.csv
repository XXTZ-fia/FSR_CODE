I purchased a 9 and they seem true to size as well. They're comfortable and soft. The heel is a reasonable size as well and isn't overwhelming.  That being said, these are kind of weird. They seem stylish at first glance, but if you can see in the pictures, the front where the material comes up over your shin needs to be more fitted to the foot rather than so far out. It also claims to be large calf friendly which might be true where the actual calf sits, but the opening to the boot is considerably smaller than the middle of the boot where the calf is.  The ""square toe"" it claims to have, isn't exactly square. It remind me of a camel hood. There's a weird squiggle for lack of a better term. It almost seems like it follows the shape of the big toe and then fans out to follow the other toes.  For how expensive they are, I'm not totally impressed. I'll probably wear them to give them a chance, as I haven't tried them on with jeans yet, but we will see.",5
