For Reference I'm 5'4 feet tall, 144lbs, 36D Chest, Ordered Size Small, Color Blue. It does run a bit bigger so if you prefer a more fitted fit, I would suggest sizing down. I'm normally medium size for clothing, but decided to order this one in ""small"" but it was a bit on the bigger side for me. The slit is on my left hand side and is super cute 😍 I will order another one in xs to see if I like it more since I love my dresses more fitted... Will update on it later. Here's an update with pictures of the blue dress. I really hope this was helpful😊  Update Aug 27, 2023: So I ordered an XS in this dress and it fit waay better than the small more fitted, so I'm guessing The Drop runs a bit big for this dress since normally I'm a medium to small. I ordered it in brown, pink and white ( I'll update again with more pics) but wow the colors are beautiful 😍 Just get your correct desired size and you should be good 😊👍",32
