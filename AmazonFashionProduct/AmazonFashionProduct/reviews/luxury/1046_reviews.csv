I didn’t mind as I was looking for closer to black. I ordered a size 4, I’m 5’2” and 135 lbs. I’m disappointed in the arm (dis)proportions especially considering the higher price tag. How is one supposed to wear sweaters and other winter clothing underneath? Thankfully the coat is lined and I think I will be warm. The collar is very classy, and the length goes to my knees. I am going to keep it as I need it for a last minute work trip to a colder climate, but buyer beware that the arm opening is quite slimmer than the rest of the coat’s fit.",

The coat was slightly too large and based on the style, it almost looked like a bathrobe when not fitted. I went back to Macy’s to order size 4 and was so disappointed when they were sold out. I quickly did a google search, and sure enough it was on Amazon for even less $. I was skeptical because of a few reviews that mentioned this was not the same coat as sold through Macy’s. Don’t be fooled. They are identical! You can see in the picture the 2 coats next to one another (Macy’s & amazon). I receive compliments on this coat every time I wear it. Color is beautiful. You won’t regret buying!",29

It's a quality mid-weight coat and the bordeaux color is deep and lovely. My only beef with this coat is that the belt loops are thin string. You have to be very careful not to tear them and I do think it cheapens the look a little. A 2 fits like an extra small. I am on the petite side and it just fits - the sleeves even hit perfectly which is rare for me and makes me think it may run a bit small on others. At 5'4"" the coat hits just below my knees.",15

The lining, weight of the material, tag, color and texture of the  fabric all 100% matched. This is a great deal and saved me a almost $100 from the on in store.",30
