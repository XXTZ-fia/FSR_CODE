It is 100% poly, very soft inside, and very warm. There are three belt loops, a large one in the back and double loops on each side so the belt can be worn higher or lower. The xxl fit me and I usually wear an 18 or 2x. Unfortunately mine has a few brown marks in the exterior so I sent it back. But nice robe otherwise.",

This is for all practical purposes a great bathrobe if you live in Seattle and go out in the rain to get your mail. For lounging around the house it is like wearing a fur lined raincoat. Really torn on what to do with this product. It is so comfortable and well made but the exterior shell feels like a raincoat. I guess I will wash it and give it 30 days. I hope washing softens the exterior shell.  This robe is growing on me. Not bad at all. Quite comfortable adding another star to review!. I see it is frequently returned, which i also was gonna do. But try it, it might grow on u!  Ok further revision...washing it does soften the shell. Its like it ships with some kind of stiffener on it. All around good product...moves up to 5 stars.
