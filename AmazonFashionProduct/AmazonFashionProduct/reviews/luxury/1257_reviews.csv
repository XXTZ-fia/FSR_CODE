Thankfully I had 3 links to take out.Overall, the watch appears to be in good working order.",

First band failed on day one. Seller was quick to send another. Band is huge. I burned three links to get mine to fit. **Be aware, the directions show removing the pins to remove links by having the link access on the wrong side. The pins are cotter pin in style. Pushing on the wrong end actually made the pin distort and not go back in solidly. I did the second pin extraction by having the pin tool enter the band with the link closest to me on the right. (Opposite as shown in the directions) The band failure occurred on a different spot. Not the areas where I removed links. So far loving the watch. Great weight and very nice looking watch.",

One hasty click later, looking at price not description, and boom! I've accidentally ordered the GOLDEN HOUR Luxury Stainless Steel Analog-Digital Watch. Talk about a happy mistake!  Unboxing day arrives, and instead of a basic plastic beeper I can see at night, I'm greeted by a gleaming masterpiece that makes my wrist feel like it won the lottery. Suddenly, I'm James Bond... if Bond were chronically tardy and easily impressed by shiny objects.  This beauty's got more features than I have excuses for being late: - Analog-digital display (for when you want to be precise, but make it fashion) - Dual time zones (because one isn't confusing enough) - Stopwatch (for timing my mad dashes to catch buses) - Alarm (loud enough to wake me from the dead on Mondays) - Water-resistant (making dish-washing unexpectedly glamorous)  The kicker? It matches my wife's pricier watch. Who am I, and what have I done with the fashion-challenged guy I used to be?  So, if you're after a watch that's part time-teller, part conversation starter, and all awesome, give GOLDEN HOUR a whirl. Just be ready for compliments and the urge to use ""horological"" in casual conversation.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a stylish wrist to admire – and a newfound punctuality to maintain!",3

It hasn't failed to keep time. But there are some things you should know.  I do ranch work and construction. So I wanted a tough watch, but I wasn't going to spend $200. The feel of the watch is nice, it's heavy, feels nice to wear, and doesn't feel cheap. I chose black (BAD IDEA) it looks like cheap black gloss paint. It was covered in plastic to keep from getting scratches during shipping. So it didn't look nice for very long, and even turns my wrist black. The analog portion of the watch is the standard pull-out-twist knob, and worked fine. However the digital part has these big clunky buttons that constantly get pressed throughout the day just by the movement of my hand and wrist. Therefore the digital time, date, and alarm were never reliable for me. The pull-out-twist knob finally came off after about a year and a half, so the time has come for a new watch. Overall, I wont be buying this watch again, but it did serve its purpose.",6
