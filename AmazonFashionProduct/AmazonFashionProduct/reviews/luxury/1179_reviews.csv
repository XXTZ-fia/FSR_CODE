Kim S.,Expensive but cheaply made. So thin you can see through it.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAS7HZ5OOSYPM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074M3SDV5,"1.0 "," the United States "," August 15, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Charcoal,Verified Purchase,"Since I paid over $100 for this poorly and cheaply made sweater, I don’t feel it even deserves one star. I was hoping for a high-quality, cuddly, and soft sweater because I wanted a cashmere sweater all my life…how utterly disappointing to be ripped off by a product from China, again.",

Rebecca F.,Odd proportions; tight in the arms & loose in the body,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF5P156L1YN33/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074M3SDV5,"3.0 "," the United States "," November 2, 2022",Size: LargeColor: Pebble,Verified Purchase,"Super soft fabric.  Lovely faun / taupe color.  I *really* *wanted* to love this sweater.  But I couldn't get over the discomfort in super tight arms (felt somewhat like a blood pressure cuff before it tightens; arm length was as expected, falling mid-hand) and wide cut in torso (wasn't flattering from any styling: untucked, French tuck, fully tucked).  Perhaps this sweater is better suited to a body that is thicker through the middle with thin arms.",2

I’m thin with weirdly long arms.  I like this brand bc the arms are always long enough. This shirt verges on being a smidge small even though I bought a medium. I’m wearing it now as a layering piece in 7 degree weather. Very comfortable and warm.,

It’s not a bog deal to twist the sleeves around so I’m not returning it. I don’t mind the un hemmed sleeves personally, but some do so there’s that. It’s very flattering and soft. Perfect for layering. I live in the south so I prefer shirts that are thinner and easily layered. I don’t really have any complaints other than the price. For that I’d expect it to be perfect.",
Susan Ridenour,"Update: Must return size L, too, cuz wasn't larger than a M/ Nice except for M fit, have to return.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QQCU5SN3AGHS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074M3SDV5,"2.0 "," the United States "," February 11, 2021",Size: MediumColor: Charcoal,Verified Purchase,"Update: I returned the Medium and bought a Large. Well, the Large is basically the same sized as a Medium. The only thing different is it is longer and the sleeves are longer. Do NOT try to get a bigger size with this sweater, it won't happen. Really disappointed! I'm so unhappy to have spent the time returning and buying another at the same price only to get the same size! Bigger means bigger all around, as in around the waist. What's so hard about that to understand?? Again: the arms are still the same size, the waist is the same, only the length of the garment and the length of the sleeves are longer.  This doesn't come in a size extra Large, though if it did, I wouldn't be surprised if their was not change in waist or sleeve  circumference. What the heck? Still waiting on my refund for the first sweater that was too small even though I measure according to the chart. Ah well -- most of the stuff I buy here is appropriately sized, so I guess one takes the good with the bad.",3

SoCalDesigner,VERY thin but Soft,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RISP4MBLHP9UN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074M3SDV5,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2020",Size: LargeColor: Pebble,Verified Purchase,"I love the look of this sweater and how they did the seams, but I'm closer to 3 stars on this and here's why:  CONS: - As others have commented this sweater is VERY thin - like a thin see-through t-shirt. - For the price, I would have expected something more substantial. - The issue with it being very very thin is its exceptionally clingy - and not in a good way. It rolls up at the bottom and hugs every single bump and curve and roll - So as long as you don't mind having all of your body show (good and otherwise), you'll like it. But if you like a sweater to come down and hide some of those Mom rolls, well, this sweater is far too thin and clingy to do that. - The beige color is green-ish. When I hold it against my true beige/brown clothing, this looks almost like a (soft) army green beige tone. - I'm a size 8/9 (36 B/C chest) and got a large, and its very fitted  PROS - Its soft - Seaming (lines) are stylish - Finger holes are great to keep my hands warm - Feels good on despite the thinness  Overall I like it and won't return it, but I wouldn't buy it again.",11

The top is chic, comfy-cozy and flattering. It’s all I want to wear, especially since COVID. I Also love the thumbholes – which I use or not depending on my mood.
