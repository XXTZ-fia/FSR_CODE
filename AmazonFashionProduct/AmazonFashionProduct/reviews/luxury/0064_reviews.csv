JTB,Color Not Accurate,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3H0YNH02UAZ2Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRGVGN4,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 5, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"The color depicted is a nice golden caramel, but it is an orangish brown.  Very nice quality but zippered opening is short, difficult to get the pillow inserted.  Love the pattern, reordered in black.",
Janey,Handsome pillow cover.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFSK2TZ6KK9B6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRGVGN4,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 28, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to go in the Den in a brown loveseat. It's well made with a good zipper and the fabric is a good weight for a pillow cover. The images printed on it are dynamic and eye catching which I loved, but unfortunately the main color was too brassy. I reluctantly returned it.",

Laura H.,Thick texture & Darker orange than shown,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R135D5LBVHVKGY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BWRGVGN4,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 26, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"One thing to note: the color is more of a darker burnt orange than the bright yellow shown in photos. This richer tone adds warmth and pairs beautifully with earthy or jewel-toned palettes. If you’re looking for a throw pillow cover with a chic animal print and a luxurious feel, this is a great option. Just keep in mind that the color leans more towards burnt orange/brown than the yellow depicted in the photos.",
