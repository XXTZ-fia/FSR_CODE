sms65965,Classy classic,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1A7WHCUM8K2JL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCBHGWK2,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 26, 2025",Size: 9Color: Black-white-new,Verified Purchase,"These are very nice. The leather is medium stiff, not difficult to break in. They are lined in a soft leather. I typically wear an 8.5 but ordered a 9 in these as I am used to wearing wide toe shoes like Doc Martens (which I typically wear an 8 in). The size 9 leave a thumb’s width of space from my big toe, and the large toe ball joint sits at the widest part when the shoe “breaks” when walking. They are comfortable and arrived in a high end box with specially formed shape keepers and shoe bags. Looking forward to wearing them for business travel coming up.",

I’d say after about a week they start to get very comfortable. I needed something professional that I could get toe deflection in since I’m a flight instructor.,
