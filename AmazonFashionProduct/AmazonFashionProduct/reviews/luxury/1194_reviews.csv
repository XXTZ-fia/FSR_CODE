itZme,"Pretty design, sturdy watch, adjustment tool included and keeps time well!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTZFMDPU843WC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJM454YN,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 29, 2025",Color: Gold,,"This watch came nicely packaged along with the link removal tool. It was easy to remove a couple links for better fit. The colored ""crystals"" are nice and bright! the gold colored metal hasn't reacted to my skin and changed color like some non-precious metals do. It has not lost any noticeable time over the last 3 days. It matches so much of my stuff with the different colors that I can wear it anytime!  Good watch at a good price!",
mindful🐝ish,Cute watch,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VVBPDRIX94NI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJM454YN,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 27, 2025",Color: Gold,,"This watch is cute even if it is made of plastic. I'm not a very materialistic person so it's fine by me. But I'm really hoping that it won't tarnish. Only time will tell there. The colorful beads inside of the links remind me of the chakra colors. I'm a yoga head so that suits me just fine. It is comfortable although it is about two links too large. They did include a tool to allow me to remove a couple of the links but I haven't figured out how to do that yet. I will probably let my mechanically inclined husband figure that out when he gets home from work. I read another review that said it's easy but I'm just not good like that and I don't want to break it. I like cute little watches that just tell the time and don't count steps etc etc, so I actually like this watch a lot!",
Cherie,Beautiful!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD5VZ0CL2MEY3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJM454YN,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2025",Color: Gold,,"This is a beautiful watch, I'm really happy with it! I've tried finding a watch like this in local stores, and they just don't exist anymore. It matches with almost anything, and so far it's been waterproof for light stuff (washing the dishes etc, I don't wear it in the shower). It keeps time well, and it's easy to read. And it's quite comfortable!  The only reason I've knocked a star off is because the gems look very likely to fall off at some point, there isn't anything except glue holding them on, and a couple are glued a tad crooked. Maybe it'll last a few years, maybe it'll last a few months, I'm not sure, it's just a concern.  That aside, again, it's beautiful for the price. It would make a great gift item!. I had to remove two of the links - the video linked in the instructions wasn't very helpful, but I figured it out on my own. Each pin in the links have a tiny slot on one side (like what you'd fit a tiny flat tip screwdriver in), and a rounded tip on the other side. Using the tool that comes with the watch, you put the slotted side against the opening, and the rounded tip against the screw side. Then you just screw in the mechanism until the pin pops out. I was a little nervous doing it, but it worked just fine!  Overall, I recommend this watch, as long as you're not expecting something that will last a super long time.",
Xanadu,Nice watch...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UNLSL6WXH4G1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJM454YN,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: Silver,,"This the first time that I've ever bought a linked watch that I didn't have to make any adjustments. I wouldn't say it's very big. The circumference of my left wrist is 6.25 in. So if you've got a wrist bigger than that it might be hard for you to fasten it.  It does not come with extra links. But it does come with a device to remove the links. So if you can find links that match and you need to add them, you can.  It's not exactly the best quality band. But it's cute. You can kind of tell that it's made of plastic. But if you're looking for an inexpensive watch to use with your wardrobe, I think you would like it.",
Opinionated,BEAUTIFUL.

Consumer,Great Colorful & Unique Watch,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23AGNVVUNRI2H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJM454YN,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 21, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"This is one of the few affordable watch models I have found that uses multicolor LEDs. The case and band are a bit large for a smaller wrists, and the polished silver is a bit bright for my taste. I chose the silver over the back coated version because the reviews stated that the black scratches easily. This watch is easy to read, once you're familiar with it. These watches can use 2016 or 2032 watch batteries, which are affordable and readily available. They come with a Chinese brand 2016, but I upgrade to a name brand 2032 for better longevity. This uses a lot of a battery life if you are checking the time (or showing off) your watch a lot.",
