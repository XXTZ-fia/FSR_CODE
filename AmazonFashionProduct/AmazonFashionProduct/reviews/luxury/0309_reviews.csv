The dial is Pumpkin color and my photo would hold true to color.  On website it was a touch more yellow(in my opinion).  The feel of wearing the watch was nice.  The texture of the band somewhat smooth, but if you have hairy wrists I can see it pulling your hair.  Nothing a trimmer can’t fix.  The watch is well worth the price.  It also comes with the tool to take out some links, took me 5 mins. I plan on getting the black one next.",

WNG,A brutally unbiased watch review from a Watch Fan.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M3VB8U5BI6YD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDF9MHSG,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2024",Color: Silver Blue,,"I've been a avid Watch Guy my whole life. Not a Watch Snob, but someone who is drawn to a finely designed watch that is aesthetically attractive, and a good value. With that, there are some one-off bespoke hand-made luxury timepieces that are state of the art, and are unobtainium. Unless you're the owner of Amazon! :-) I appreciate and respect them for their achievements.  So, I won't be comparing this BARAMON Royalty men's watch with the watch that this one was inspired by, the A.P. Royal Oak. No more than one can compare a Fiat 500 to a Ferrari 599. Watches are classified to their own categories and separated by price. This one is in the tier of cosmetic jewelry, and it is priced accordingly. A fair review is to compare it against its peers within this category.  Upon seeing this Baramon, one realizes it is attempting to be a facsimile of the iconic A.P. Royal Oak, as recognizable a classic Swiss timepiece as the Rolex. I would love me an authentic Royal Oak self-winder, but my sensible side regarding value and logic forbids any endeavor to buy one. I rather put those funds toward a house!  So, from the seller's photos and description, I wanted one believing it is a pretty good effort to copy the style of the icon. Especially for the asking price. I chose the popular Blue face version.  It arrived in a handsome faux-leather display case. Presentation is very nice and gift worthy. First impression, the watch is substantial, the bracelet is stainless steel and links are solid and has weight to it. The butterfly clasp works well and not flimsy. Inspecting the body, the brushed and polish finish are very good, and the body is claimed to be alloy. It's heavy like steel, not light as if zinc, or aluminum. It could be brass and nickel plated perhaps. The maker doesn't list it as S.S., so it's either brass or carbon steel. And plated to look stainless steel. The width is 42mm. The A.P. Royal Oak ranges from 40-42mm as per model. The face mimics the the pattern very well, but the blue color is darker than expected, and is of a matte finish, not glossy. The hour markings do look like the original as well. The crown is not the iconic hexagon. Nor is the body an octagon. The sides have the sharp lines polished away. I can forgive these at this price range though.  But there are unacceptable flaws and choices though. 1. The 8 hexagon screws in the front bezel are randomly placed and not aligned like in the seller's photos and like the Royal Oak. Only 2 of the 8 screws are correctly aligned. This is unforgivable, and whomever in charge of this assembly should be reprimanded and the manager who allowed these to be shipped out, fired! This alone is grounds for a return. 2. The octagonal front bezel is the wrong size (width). The bezel is supposed to align with the octagonal body's edges flush. But this bezel overhangs the body in 4 locations. 3. The watch body's top and bottom edges appears to be too wide. It looks off compared to the body of a Royal Oak. Perhaps this is an anomaly caused by the too large octagonal bezel. 4. The butterfly clasp's locking links...one of them is casted or machined with a section not flat. It's bent upward and does not lay flush when closed. (see photos) This protrusion snags cuffs and sleeves of your clothes. Most annoying.  If you are going to create a watch to mimic the style of an iconic model, then you got to get the basic details correct and accurate. The Baramon Royalty did not. Thus it only deserves 3 stars. It is a fair assessment, because it's not compared to a $100,000 Swiss watch, it's being compared to its competitors in this cosmetic jewelry category. The competitors offer a better facsimile with attention to details correct, or better in compromise, for similar money or a for a few dollars more.  The positives are that the watch's quartz movement keeps accurate time. Compared to a computer synced to a time server, it hasn't varied in days. The bracelet was executed well for its price too.  But it didn't meet expectations even for a cosmetic 'play' watch. They got the screw alignment wrong and that's unforgivable. All their competitors at least got that done right!",2

It was in a leather faux case and seating on a nice pillow. It was too big for his wrist, and we knew we would have to remove some leaks. The watch come with a nice little leak remover tool. It took a minute to figure out how to remove the leaks with the tool, but once we figured it out it was a breeze, and it fits him perfectly now. The light on the watch works, and it is built like a quartz. Very nice watch and looks very expensive. Made out of high-quality material. Very giftable watch for any occasion.

The hand on mine DO glow in the dark so apparently that is a variable based on the finish you get. I was kind of surprised to see a $20ish watch in a stiched leatherette gift box which just adds to the value if you are gift giving. Instructions for the watch are clear and minimal as you don't need much...BUT...instructions for the band are entirely absent and you WILL need to adjust the band size unless you are Andre the Giant! I'm a big guy but still had to remove 2 links without knowing how. Fortunately...the little included poker was a hint and as you can see from my third picture...you use it to poke out the hinge pins and remove links to reduce the size. Really pretty easily done and the release push button mechanism is a pleasure to use. This watch is constructed so well and looks so good and keeps perfect time at a great price. I've never had a better watch value. Someone would love this as a Christmas gift!,

Another reviewer likened the look to a Red Oak and I agree.  It arrived with the stem pulled so the battery still has power.  The white numerals and gold hands on the black face with the gold case is extremely attractive.  The band, however, was a pain to adjust. It starts out on the longer side so I needed to remove two links per side. The difficulty arose with removing the pins. I bent two link removers and used my work pliers to pull out the corroded pins that are made from a soft metal; softer metal isn’t necessarily a problem if they slide out. After getting the pins out I picked the two least damaged and finally got the band reassembled.  The clasp was ornery to click into place after that but secure once it connected. I may or may not get a different band or strap. The watch, then, gets a five but the band only a one. That’s a three in the end.",

Dan,One of the least expensive ways to enjoy the iconic design of the Royal Oak I have seen,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28Z6MNRBLIHOL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDF9MHSG,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 14, 2023",Color: Silver Blue,,"Remember this watch costs just over $20, so please interpret everything I say within that context. You can pay $100 to $1000 for other Royal Oak homage watches from other brands that make homage watches, but I am going to review what you get with this one for only $20.  First thing to note is that this has a quartz movement. No surprise there for the price. But, the overall effect of the watch is convincing. It is easy to spot the differences and know that it is not a genuine AP Royal Oak even with a casual glance from a distance, so there is no expectation of authenticity. The design of the Royal Oak is iconic and attractive, and it translates well into this very inexpensive variant without the question marks about whether it is real or not -- it is clear from the start that it is not, and that is OK.  The finishing is what you would expect for the price point. There are some sharp points and edges, the watch band gaps and clearances are large and rattle when you shake them, the taper of the bracelet is accomplished in only the top two links, the butterfly clasp has a lot of movement and clearances once snapped, and the bezel overhangs the case slightly on each side. Design wise, the crown is round instead of octagonal, the date window has a white background instead of black like the genuine article, and the face lacks any branding logo and says ""QUARTZ"" at the 6 o'clock position. However, the face is genuinely 3D with the waffle pattern and the indices are applied. The indices and hands are painted white in the middle, but do not have any lume. The color of the face is a darker shade of blue than I was expecting, but I will say the color changes dramatically with lighting, ranging from deep blue in bright sunlight to almost black in a normal room lit with incandescent lights. You can see the variation in the pictures.  It wears well and sits comfortably on my 7.75"" wrist. I removed 2 links from the bracelet with the link pin tool they provided with the watch (nice touch), so it will easily accommodate larger wrists as well. It is also relatively thin, which is nice. It comes in a nice, hinged watch box with stitched faux leather exterior sporting the BARAMON logo on the outside, and it comes on a watch pillow.  Given all this, it comes across as a great way to enjoy the design of the ultra-luxury expensive Audemars Piguet Royal Oak at a Casio price. Nobody will think you're trying to pull a fast one on them. In my opinion they will nod at your good taste combined with your fiscal responsibility. It earns a full five stars because it does all this for just a bit over $20.",4

It has a stainless steel case that is 42mm. It’s design is similar to a big brand name watch company but with a price that will not break the bank.

The watch has three hands for minutes, hours, and seconds as well as a date display. I find the watch to be accurate after setting the correct time and observing it for a couple of days. The watch is rated at 30m waterproof but have not tested that yet, however, I have gotten some water splashed on the case when I was washing my hands and the water had no effect on the watch. Overall, this is a good watch that looks expensive and can be used for business or casual use. It comes with a watch link removal tool so that you can adjust the watch band to your wrist size. It feels great on the wrist and does not feel too light or too heavy. I don't normally wear watches that are 42mm in size as I feel they're just a little too small but this may work for most people.  Pros: + Great Build + Nice Stylish Design + Accurate Movement  Cons: - Watch face can be just a little bigger",

JL,Nice watch for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WW7VZ7HGKF5G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDF9MHSG,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2023",Color: Gold,,"This watch looks good and keeps time accurately. It’s a nice size for someone like myself with a large wrist. For $20 you’re getting a nice looking watch that feels pretty  good on your wrist. It’s definitely not as heavy or solid feeling as my high end watches, but for the price I wouldn’t expect it to be.  The clasp is actually nice and seems to be pretty sturdy. Overall, you get a nice watch that won’t break the bank and looks a lot like a much more expensive one.",
Amazon Customer,Nice inexpensive watch,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1M9HHIOJDHB1O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDF9MHSG,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 12, 2023",Color: Black,,"I've never been much of a watch guy (though I used to have a fake Rolex I got in NYC for fun), but for $20, you can't beat the look of this piece.  It was pretty easy to set up out of the box - adjusted the time & date, peeled the protective plastic off the face glass, and pulled a few of the links out of the band for a better fit.  The instructions are pretty useless, but not really needed (they supply the tool for popping the pins out of the band).  Comes in a nice case with a little pillow.  I can't comment on how it will keep time long term, but seems to be doing good so far.  Feels really sturdy, but again, for $20, it wouldn't be the end of the world if it isn't.  I guess I'm a watch guy now!",

Shirley S.,Everyday watch,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDYUVL8NE0DNH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDF9MHSG,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 11, 2023",Color: Silver Blue,,"The packaging of the watch is good & comes with a manual and pin ejector too. I had to detach 4 cuffs in total ( 2 on each side) to make it fit my partner's hands, and when I took the pins out I could see the pins were a bit rusted. The watch does not have any branding on the dial either even though it looks like a copy of Audemar Piguet's Royal Oak watch. I heavily feel that even though the decsription says its steel, its not, and will possibly rust due to sweat and dust. Recommended still as a daily wearable watch",
