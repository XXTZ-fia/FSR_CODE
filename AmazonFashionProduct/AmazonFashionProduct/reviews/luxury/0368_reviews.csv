Victoria Givens,A Flattering and Versatile Wardrobe Staple,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTM0OUYKXRIYH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YNQX453,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 16, 2024",Color: GreenSize: Large,Verified Purchase,"As a working professional, finding the perfect balance between style and comfort can be a challenge. That's why I was pleasantly surprised by the CEASIKERY Women's Business Retro Cocktail Pencil Dress. This dress quickly became a go-to piece in my office wardrobe, and I'm confident it will become a staple in yours too.  Let's start with the fit. The stretchy material hugs your curves in all the right places, creating a sleek and flattering silhouette. I appreciated how it accentuated my waistline without feeling too constricting or uncomfortable. And true to the product description, the sizing is accurate – I ordered my usual size, and it fit like a dream.  The quality of the fabric is another standout feature. It has a substantial weight to it, which gives the dress a luxurious feel and prevents any unsightly cling or wrinkles. Plus, the stretch ensures ease of movement, so you can go about your day without feeling restricted.  But what really elevates this dress is its versatility. The classic pencil cut and retro style make it appropriate for the office, while the sleek lines and sophisticated color options allow it to transition seamlessly to after-work events or cocktail parties. I can easily dress it up with heels and statement jewelry or keep it casual with a blazer and flats.  While I absolutely adore this dress, there is one minor drawback worth mentioning. The fabric, while high-quality, can be a bit prone to static cling, especially in drier weather. A quick spritz of static guard or a light mist of hairspray usually does the trick, but it's something to keep in mind.  The CEASIKERY Women's Business Retro Cocktail Pencil Dress is a fantastic investment piece that combines style, comfort, and versatility. Whether you're headed to the office, a conference, or a night out with friends, this dress will have you feeling confident and put-together. Highly recommended for any professional woman seeking a chic and flattering addition to her wardrobe.",5

Dreaded having to shop for one especially since I gained weight. IM 5'3"" & 178 LBS.  I saw this dress and asked myself what do I have to lose? SO glad I did!  You can ditch the hours of searching, in and out of different stores and dressing rooms, sore feet, achy back and waste of gas trying to find the perfect dress and JUST ORDER THIS DRESS!  According to the size guide they suggested a size Large with waist up to 32.7. My waist is 33.  I went against the size guide and got 1 size up because it was so close and I like a little extra room so I got the XL. Was concerned at first that it might not be large enough. When I started to put it on over head it didn't seem there would be too much give but I got it on, tugged it down and straightened out and it felt wonderful!  This was too good to be true. It fit in all the right spots and that little extra room was enough. I headed over to the mirror and I was shocked on how good it looked! I ordered the purple verses the same ole safe black. I'm so delighted with this dress. Glad I took the chance, glad I ordered the next size up and so glad I took a chance with the purple! Nice job!!!",16

The pictures do not do it justice in person.  And the POCKETS. Whoever designed this dress deserves a medal. You always run that risk of “saddlebags” when you get dresses with pockets but these are amazing. Tucked to the front side of your legs instead of the sides of your hips, and roomy because of that gathered waist area.  The only downside for me is I don’t quite have the real estate up top that the dress can handle, so I had a little gapping issue, but nothing that I can’t tighten up a bit to fit better.
