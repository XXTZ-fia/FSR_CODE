Ruby Smith,Meh!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16KT1GHJACBNQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CSPHB36,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",Size: 25Color: Adrenaline Rush,Verified Purchase,"Fit super weird. I'm a standard size 0-2 and these were too baggy in the front, too tight in the back and SO long. The interior ankle slit also comes up to a weird hight.",
Cynthia DeVries,Jeans with slits up the sides,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9CILYFFUB53J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CSPHB36,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 23, 2023",Size: 32Color: Not Having It,Verified Purchase,I like that they are very different from what I would normally get for myself. Runs a little small but determined to fit into them soon.,
Niamh Gordon,Wanted to like these,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YLNH8EPUP4R0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CSPHB36,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 7, 2022",Size: 29Color: Not Having It,Verified Purchase,"I so badly wanted these to work for me. It felt like true denim and good quality. Unfortunately, I tried my true size, one below and one above and none seemed quite right.",
K.,so cute and quality but..,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E0BHSYB26T4K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CSPHB36,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 21, 2022",Size: 32Color: Not Having It,Verified Purchase,"I ordered these jeans in my size and had to return them unfortunately. They are good quality and have a super cute style, but because they’re 100% cotton, didn’t fit to my shape. would recommend if you can fit 100% cotton jeans!",
Haley Gonzalez,Obsessed!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KTR7PGODGN4G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CSPHB36,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 21, 2022",Size: 25Color: Adrenaline Rush,,I really love BLANKNYC jeans! I would say this brand run a bit big. I typically wear a 26/27 in jeans and for this style I had to get the 25. But that could be because it sits at your true natural waist. They are SUPER long and could be hemmed but then you’d lose the split hem. I’m 5’4” and they fit perfect when I wear 4” heels (which is how I plan to wear them) but just a word of caution. (Ignore my scrunched toes LOL)  I really love how high they go without giving you the dreaded “mom butt”. The split hem is so chic. I’m obsessed. Can’t wait to wear them out!,4
Amaz0n Cust0mer,meh,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16U4Z0OGHMUPG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CSPHB36,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2022",Size: 24Color: Bending Over Backwards,,not sure,
Stephanie Laughlin,My Mom Never Looked This Good,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GYJRZGFGW6SN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CSPHB36,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2022",Size: 25Color: Spitting Image,Verified Purchase,Mom jeans are definitely in nowadays. These a perfect fit and super cute. I think they look better with a heel because the ankle is a little tapered/boot cut. I am 5'2 and I have to stand on my tippy toes for that perfect flawless look.,
Terri,Do NOT hold their shape at all; very baggy after having them on for a bit.  Very disappointed : (,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VVTP7AITR3ZG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CSPHB36,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 28, 2021",,Verified Purchase,I really like the style - more of a mini boot in my opinion rather than a straight style.  Thought they fit well when I tried them on but after wearing for a couple of hours they sag and completely loose their shape.,
WitchyWoman,Nice Jeans,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33ZTUHGZ6CUWX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CSPHB36,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 15, 2021",,Verified Purchase,Like Jeans should be. Love the straight leg.  They are true to size,

Wehr,Love them,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X31NKJI79IZZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08CSPHB36,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 3, 2021",,Verified Purchase,The first pair of jeans in years that actually come up to my natural waist and long enough too.  Pretty heavy duty denim. Hoping they don't  shrink when washed and dried.,
