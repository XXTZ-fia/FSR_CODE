It was nice but fell apart the first time it was washed. Ordered this one & couldn't be happier. It's quite an upgrade from the other robe! This robe is well made and quite sturdy. It has a velour outer coat with a terry cloth interior. Makes for a more upscale and very comfortable wearing. My son is 5'11, 150lbs and the M/L fits nicely. A little loose for moveability which is great. It's much heavier than your average terry cloth robe so be sure to have a sturdy place to hang. Has been washed and dried (on gently/low) and is in perfect shape with zero shrinkage. Well worth the cost, very pleased with purchase.",
