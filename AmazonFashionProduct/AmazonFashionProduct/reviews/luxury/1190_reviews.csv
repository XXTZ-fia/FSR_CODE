I also liked that they kept me warm all through winter. The material is so comfortable inside I had to get them in black for more regular wear. The baby pink ones I’d have to wash every week with comet powder as they got dirty at the bottom after a few trips in them the black ones would be easier to care for. The boot is not tight on the inside so someone with a wide foot can be comfortable for hours in them. It did not lose its shape but did have a small crease which is pretty normal for wearing shoes multiple times. Can’t really notice them on the black ones. I’ve had compliments with both boots. I love them I’d get these every winter if I could.,5
