Huddy,STRONG chemical smell,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23CKD82RUMG4Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKK27SR2,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"About the quality you’d expect for paying $45. The materials are very low quality but the shoe fits true to size. Worst part was the nauseating chemical smell. I’ve never smelled a pair of shoes that smelled so strongly of whatever factory finish they put on them. Maybe it was just the pair I received, but it’s definitely worth spending extra money to buy something more quality. Wouldn’t buy again.",

They look and feel great.  I have multiple pairs of shoes that I have that are name brand/""higher-quality,"" but none get as many complimets as these. You can dress them up or down.  At under $40, you're not getting better than this.",

SMP8,Better than average faux leather shoe,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R156NZROHUGA72/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKK27SR2,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 14, 2024",Color: BrownSize: 8.5,Verified Purchase,They were a bit larger than expected but close. The color is even and the styling good. The shiny black plastic sole detracts from the overall appearance. If you buy these put several thin coats of polish on them and they’ll look less cheap.,

The price is such a bargain compared to others. The material is great quality and looks lovely! When worn, they fit great! Sizing is accurate, if not slightly bigger.

Took a little longer than what I am used to with other Amazon orders but worth the wait. Feels comfortable and looks stylish.

Noah Reeds,Cheap,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3N3GT0GMEPIPL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKK27SR2,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 5, 2024",Color: BrownSize: 9.5,Verified Purchase,I knew going in a 33 dollar loafer wouldn’t be the best quality however these feel like a 5 dollar shoe. First inspection I noticed the quality control isn’t the best. The material is closer to rubber than leather. Overall structure is poor I can twist these things in my hands. I tried to look past all this and try them on but when you walk it sounds like the Spongebob Boot episode where they squeak like crazy. The style is nice and what drew me to purchase the shoe but they did not deliver in the cheap but nice category.,

421701,"Nice LOOKING but pretty soft, low-quality sole and little support.  Still, there's a use case.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23S015QG00GJN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKK27SR2,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 19, 2024",,,"So… These are fine shoes at the right price point if you want something that will look good at work but which you are not going to wear a lot or walk in extensively.  Let me explain.  They fit true to size.  They are shiny and perfectly “office” looking.  They are not uncomfortable.  But they offer little internal support.  The sole is relatively soft and squishy. I could see after just a couple days some rubber coming off the edge—see photo.  Also, the shoes are very squishy.  My feet sink into them a little as I walk.  I think this will translate to relatively quick wear of the soles, and they don’t provide enough orthopedic support to wear all day on your feet.  But for me, walking around an office from chair to chair they are nice. They are currently listed at $49.  That seems a little steep for the quality you’re getting.  They might last for a year of light use.  You could spend more and get something that would last longer and be better support for work on your feet.  3 stars at this price because of the low quality of the soles.  I think for $20 - $30 I would be forced to rate higher just given the nice appearance.",6
Shawn,Cushioning dress shoes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WIZTVPQWR4TE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKK27SR2,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 6, 2024",Color: Black-2Size: 9.5,,I had doubts on slip on dress shoes because I didn't think it would be secured. This is definitely more comfortable than my old shoes from k-mart. It has good cushioning for a dress shoe.,
