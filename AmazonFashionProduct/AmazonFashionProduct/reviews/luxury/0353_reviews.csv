No comparison in the two jackets, yet price was comparable. I have no idea of the fit of this jacket. I folded the jacket back up and put it back in its bag and never had hubby try it on.

Made in China of course.  Bottom line, the coat looks good and is very easy to wear.  The size ran fairly true. Maybe a little bit small. I have bigger arms than usual.  I lift weights and had to go up one size. Got a little bit better fit that worked.  I’m pleased. To get a high quality coat the cost would have been several hundred dollars.",3
