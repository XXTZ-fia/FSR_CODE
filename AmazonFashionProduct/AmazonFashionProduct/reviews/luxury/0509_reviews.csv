I purchased size 26, and weight between 115-120 lbs and am 5’1” tall. Purchased the color A trip, the lighter ones with not as much distressing. They are the perfect length, most are too short or too long, but these are perfect for for me being a mom that still wants to look stylish and hates super long shorts as my legs are short. They feel expensive, thick material, and a great steal at only like $20. Love the color and fit great.",

I ordered a size 27 and they fit perfectly in the waist... however, I do have skinny legs and know I am not built like the average woman. The legs of the shorts were way too big on me. They look a bit lose on the model, which is what I was expecting because she is very thin and built like I am. If you don't have thighs to fill this out, you may run into the same issue. I would have kept them otherwise and hated to return them. At almost 30 bucks though, I couldn't justify keeping them considering the issue. I'm very straight and athletically built. Hope this helps!",6
