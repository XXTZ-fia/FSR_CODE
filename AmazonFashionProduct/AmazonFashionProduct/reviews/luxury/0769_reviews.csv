Lmartin,A ‘look for less’ BB belt.. but you get what you pay for.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ4UZOXXV1PXD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNYWKPGG,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 7, 2024","Color: BlackSize: 31""-34""Waist Adjustable",,"My son wanted this belt.. he and his friends are obsessed with the BB belts on TikTok.. they style them with what I remember as 90s jeans, graphic tees. BUT he is a realistic kid and knew a real belt was NOT happening. He found these and showed me that they look so close to the real deal that he was very excited about it. Since the price was affordable I grabbed him one for his birthday. He was excited to get it and said the fit was perfect. He wore it a few times and then a few of the rhinestones fell out.. at school none the less. He found a few and I was able to reglue them but he is missing several so it’s now relegated to the back of the closet. He said he would wear it around but NOT to school. He doesn’t want to be shedding his rhinestones walking down the hall. Apparently that’s not a look a senior in HS wants to make. I don’t blame him! I guess this time we got what we paid for. :(",
CW,Nice 👍,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RB55QYX6O9NZS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNYWKPGG,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 19, 2024","Color: GoldSize: 35""-38""Waist Adjustable",Verified Purchase,I think this belt shines nicely in the sunlight.

Clara,The design is beautiful,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31ERQ765PXTO7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNYWKPGG,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 21, 2024",,,"I accidentally selected the wrong size because my waist is 34 inches. Hence, it's a little tight on me. However, the overall quality of the belt is decent. The part that you push the belt through is a bit shaky as I have to adjust it. I love the design and many people compliment on it. It's a good purchase once you get your correct size.",
MELISSA M.,Nice but heavy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27K28UF5QPX6Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNYWKPGG,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 6, 2024","Color: BlackSize: 26""-30""Waist Adjustable",,"This is a really nice and well-made belt is for men or women as the design is neutral it is studded entirely, which I think gives it the weight. It fits great looks amazing. It’s just a little heavy.",
Philippa Alderton,Bling da bling bling bling!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MA0CIZAJLHFY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNYWKPGG,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 26, 2024","Color: GoldSize: 35""-38""Waist Adjustable",,"I love this belt! As I am officially retired, and a senior citizen, I tend to dress somewhat less than conservatively nowadays. I just suit myself. Now, while I fully understand that belts like this are more appropriate for western riders, they're also great fun when I decide to go out in my tie dye and bling! Some people are simply way too serious, and I intend to have fun, so I got this belt to add to my wardrobe and I love it!  Great places to wear this sort of cheerful nonsense include at the voting booth, any halfway costumy party or gathering, all over. Please, be aware that this is NOT a cheap costume piece. It is a well made belt, and the bling is well and solidly set. This is NOT a use once and throw away. It's a quality piece.",

The vibrant pink hue makes it versatile for both casual and formal occasions, and its precise craftsmanship showcases a keen sense of style. This belt is more than an accessory; it's a bold expression of fashion, perfect for those who aim to leave a lasting impression with their distinctive choices!",
Pace,Cute but,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14XP4K4GRT611/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNYWKPGG,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2024","Color: Ba&whSize: 26""-30""Waist Adjustable",,Love the look of this belt. Nice and heavy well made belt. But the sizing is way off. I ordered large belt size than my jeans and other belts. It is way too small. So I can't wear it,
B.

I absolutely love the ab crystals. They look just so pretty. They are really attractive. They reflect different colors, but it isn't over the top at all. It just looks great. The belt seems nice and thick and really well made. It was easy to put on and a great fit. It was comfortable. It would look nice with a dress, jeans or anything. I was really very happy and would highly recommend it.",
Customer review,The 90s called! It wants its belt back xD,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1F1CQAV7PCV69/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNYWKPGG,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2024","Color: Ba&whSize: 31""-34""Waist Adjustable",,"Ok, honestly, this belt is kind of tacky but I love it! No, it's not necessarily going to be your 'wear to work daily' belt, but that's not why you buy a faux leather belt covered in rhinestones. My daughter is an adult size large and the 31""-34"" fits her perfectly. The edge beading might be a bit much, but I appreciate the thought behind the detail, and the fact that it's sewed on instead of glued. We've rolled it and unrolled it multiple times, tugged on the buckle and worried the rhinestones. So far, nothing is budging. I imagine over time the leather will crack and the rhinestones might come off with excessive use, but for our purposes - occasional wear - this belt is fabulous. Over the top in the best way xD",
Orion R.,Super cute belt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MEM301P8OFL1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNYWKPGG,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2024","Color: Ba&whSize: 26""-30""Waist Adjustable",,"This belt is really cute and seems well-made - the crystals are firmly attached to the belt and don't seem like they're going to fall off or get knocked loose when it's worn out and about. The one thing that people need to know about this belt is that the crystals make it pretty heavy! This might be uncomfortable for some people, or make this belt a bad option for pants made out of a delicate or lightweight fabric. Overall, I recommend it, but it might not work for everyone or all outfits.",
Anagram,"Looks great, but best for pants with belt loops",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15ZAYT01TBG4Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CNYWKPGG,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2024",,,"The belt looks just like the description photos and overall I like the way it looks with my dress, but I won't wear it with the dress for two reasons: 1. There is no loop to catch the excess belt, so it sort of hangs there/curls in awkwardly. 2. The belt sheds a little bit of glitter, so on a black dress it really shows up and looks sloppy. I'd guess the black one would have been better to wear with a black dress, since the black glitter probably doesn't show as obviously if it flakes off.  However, it's a really fun belt and with jeans it works great. As long as you have belt loops to hold up the extra length of it, it adds a nice sparkle to an outfit.",
