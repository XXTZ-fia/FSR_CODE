Square watches tend to wear (look) bigger than a standard round case. (And watches always look bigger in wrist-shot-photographs, so this photo is making the watch appear to be much larger than it is.) I have a few other Aknight watches and they look good and have held up nicely, so I was very happy to see this option now in their lineup. Thankfully, I was just as happy upon receipt. The watch looks even better in person, was very easy to size (it comes with a pin remover, which is very helpful, should you not already have one on hand), and is very comfortable to wear. The corners are, thankfully, rounded a bit more than they look in the photos, so it looks a bit more up to date and stylish than it might have had the corners been sharp and pointed. My only complaint is that there is no date complication and no seconds markers, but that's really just a personal preference. Overall, it's a very nice watch, especially for the price.",4

The dial has a really nice color. The hour markers shine when the light hits it and it’s very easy to read. You can’t hear it tick which is what I love the most.  The dial size isn’t big at all so it can be worn with those with small wrists. The metal band flows well with the head of the watch but you can always switch it out for anything that you like.  Obviously to a watch enthusiast, this is a throwaway watch but unless you’re speaking with someone who really cares about the inner workings of a watch (which is rarely anybody) it’s then a great complimentary piece that you can wear.  Simply put, if you need a watch that looks nice, and works, this is the one for you. Don’t care about those who think Quartz watches are garbage. They’re not. They’re great and accurate. And above all, wear what YOU like!",14

The only negative is the watch band which does not have a micro adjustment feature so its fit is less than likely to be perfect.  Otherwise the watch is favorably priced as a fashion statement so the manufacturer should sell a boatful.  Purchase the OP blue and it looks fabulous.,

So I looked around and found this little guy for $30. I took a shot, and I’m glad I did. I mean, at this price point, there’s really only one reason to buy it… that turquoise dial! And it’s a really good looking dial! The color really pops.  But there are a couple of pleasant surprises too. Applied indexes and logo, a nice looking hand set, a framed date window, and the logo is used as the second hand counterbalance. All really good stuff! On mine, the second hand even hits all the minute marks. Now, obviously there’s some cost cutting going on here. Plated alloy case, low grade mineral crystal, and a horrible bracelet (I had to deduct a star for that bracelet). I just took the bracelet off and threw a cheap steel mesh one on. It looks fantastic! I think it would look great on a light grey silicone strap too. I think I’ll try it.  So if you’re looking for a nice looking watch at a great price, this is one to consider. Especially if you just want to try a different color to see how you feel about it. The price is unbeatable, and the watch really does look more expensive than it is!",2
