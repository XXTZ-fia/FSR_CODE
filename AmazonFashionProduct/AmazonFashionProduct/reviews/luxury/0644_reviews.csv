ana,"XL is quite large, would fit a big man",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3647RCYI8ZRK2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKLCZNV5,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 28, 2025",,Verified Purchase,"I’m 5’8” and 175 lbs woman and two of me would have plenty of room in it. I’m definitely keeping it because it’s difficult to find a good cotton robe to be long enough. This one goes mid calf and I like it though the very ample sleeves make it look a bit masculine. I removed the pockets and it slimmed it down a bit. Make sure you wash prior to use to remove excess lint. Totally recommend, would have preferred the LG size but I’m keeping it anyways. Very good quality and 100% cotton",

I'm a big woman (250/5'6) and this robe wrapped around me and then some. It was a bit long tho and would touch the ground if my knees bent and the tops of my feet standing. Honestly the ONLY complaint I have... is that it only lasted a year before pretty much falling apart. In the pictures you see that a lot of the fabric is thinning and that's how it tore. If you won't be as hard on your robe as I was... this is a wonderful option.,2
