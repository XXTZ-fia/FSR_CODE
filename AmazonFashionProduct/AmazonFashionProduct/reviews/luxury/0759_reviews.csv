The blue color is true to how it appears online and the fabric ended up being better than I expected as it's not a thin jersey-like fabric, but it has more of a thick sweater feel which makes it great to wear later in the Fall/early Winter. Outdoor temps can drop but you'll still be cute, warm, and comfortable in this set! The top is a bit more cropped than I would like it to be but that's my personal preference. The good thing is that the skirt is long and fitted so one can easily pull it up to make up for the shirt's cropped length, without sacrificing much coverage on your legs. I do love that I can mix and match this set with other items in my closet. I often find myself throwing on a pair of high waisted skinnies with the cropped sweater in this set and a pair of riding boots, so this set can be versatile which also makes it a good value buy. At 5'6/115 lbs size SM, the fit of this set looks similar to that of what it looks like on the model in the listing photos, except I find the fabric to look thicker in person.  Based on the look, quality, feel and fit, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to add a cute outfit to their Fall/Winter closet.",

I actually think it looks better pulled up higher and no midsection showing then when it does lower when the skirt is pulled down lower the sweater does have a tendency to look like it is bulging out. This could also be because as I said I am curvy. I bought this in both the tan and green for my skin tone I prefer the tan that was the only reason why I did return the green but overall a great outfit in my opinion very forgiving and flattering.

You can pull the skirt up to your waist to prevent your midsection from being exposed at all times, or keep the skirt at your hips if that’s the look you’re going for.
