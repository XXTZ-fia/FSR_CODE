The dark gold band and case is attractive and masculine looking. The case is scalloped around the bezel, and it has a faceted bezel. Both reflect the light in stunning patterns, and the bezel reminds one of a diamond. The clasp is a fold open type that keeps it all connected, but it has push to unlock buttons so it won’t open accidently. Another nice feature is they provide you with a watchband tool so you can remove links if necessary to make the watch fit perfectly.  That being said, they kind of skimped on the box for such a beautiful watch. Although the outside of the box isn’t bad, the inside is just a felt covered piece of foam with the watch laying in a depression cut out for it, and the user manual laying on top. Not exactly a gift box in my opinion. The other thing to mention is the crown has three positions; all the way in for normal use, one step out for day and date, and one more step out for time setting. I had trouble setting the watch at first, because the two “out” steps are VERY small. The first one is 0.33mm (0.013”), and the second one is an additional 0.66mm (0.026”). My fingernail was thicker than the first step! Since this watch is very likely to be given as a gift, I am giving it a 4 rating for the packaging.",

For an inexpensive watch this was not a bad buy, The looks I thought were good and the color scheme turned out to be nice. I have small wrists but the removal of four links was not an issues. HOWEVER, the link removal tool that came with it was Cheap and did not work, but I had my own tools and the removal was straight forward then. This still left me four more links that can be removed so this could fit a pretty small wrist. This type of Clasp Latching system was new to me and there is a small learning curve. I have included some pictures that I hope might help. You have to let it hang down from your wrist and push up from the middle of the latching system then push in from both sides till they meet in the middle then they latch together. Is not hard once you figure it out but wanted to make sure you are aware of this type.  The directions are for several different types of watches but that's not uncommon now days. I still gave it 5 stars but I think they should have shown some pictures of how it works.",

The plastic ""tool"" that comes with the watch is useful but a bit cheap (it's all plastic except for the actual pin that moves the links).  Overall, I'd say it's a pretty, inexpensive watch with a funny kind of band that will probably require some adjustment, and you may wish to hire a pro to do the adjustment, but doing that will cost you money. If you're like me, you'll do it yourself, even if it is confusing.  One last word-- the band is ""unusual"" and if you put on the watch and forget that it latches ""both ways"" you'll soon feel like Dr. Sardonicus-- able to put it on, BUT UNABLE TO TAKE IT OFF!

Mad Hatter,Impressive looking watch,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYFJ0IIERFT0U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D97Z17K9,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 4, 2023",,,"This is an impressive looking watch. The case diameter is a nice size for my wrist. The faceted crystal adds interest to the watch. I wonder how it will age as I wear the watch and bang it around. The blue face looks good. I was able to adjust the watch to my wrist with relative ease. It took some time as I could not be certain how many links to remove, so the task was to do this one by one. The case and bracelet are highly polished. Overall, the watch looks expensive. I have a much more expensive watch that looks inexpensive by comparison. That said, the expensive watch and this watch serve very different purposes and have different movements.  The bracelet makes a weird rattling noise when off the wrist. I don't know why that is. Other watches I have with metal bracelets sound more sturdy. I don't love the faceting that is directly over the day of week and date window as the facet distorts the text and number below. It would be better to put this information between the facets (somewhere like the 17 minute mark). The day of week and date appear to be a little off center - it's hard to say because of the faceting. If it is off center it is something that most people would not notice. I found the crown a bit difficult to manipulate. It was easy to place in the close position and the position to change the time. It was more difficult to get into position to change the day of week and date feature.",

Also removing the links took a little work to get the right fit, but it was doable.  I like it.",

The diamond Roman scale on the dial makes it easy to read and adds a touch of elegance to the classic business style. The large denomination with day date function is convenient for daily use.  The watch has an analog quartz movement, which provides stable and accurate timekeeping. The 316L stainless steel strap is sturdy and comes with a hidden butterfly push button to prevent sweating, which is a thoughtful design. The watch also comes with a tool to adjust the strap, making it easy and convenient to operate.  This watch is 30M waterproof and meets daily waterproof needs. However, it is not recommended for long time underwater sports. The luminous function is a nice touch and allows you to read the watch in a dark environment.  This quartz watch makes a perfect gift for gentlemen, businessmen, business elites, leaders, young people, colleagues, boyfriends, husbands, fathers, etc. It is ideal for Valentine's Day, Father's Day, Christmas, Thanksgiving, birthdays, anniversaries, and other occasions.  The OLEVS men's watch comes with a 30-day return period and 2-year warranty, which is reassuring. The quality after-sales service provided by the company is appreciated.  Overall, the OLEVS men's watch is a good choice for those looking for a reliable, stylish, and functional watch. The only reason I gave it a 4-star rating is that the watch is not suitable for long time underwater sports.",

They look great, have Japanese movements, last and are inexpensive. A real grand slam. I have several of them and each one has served me well - not only because they are virtually trouble free, but because they look like a million bucks. Elegant designs are key to this brand. Where else can you find a quality watch at this price point. I'm not trying to say they're on par with Rolex...just that they are definitely worth the money - particularly if you're on a budget.",
