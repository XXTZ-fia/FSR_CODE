AJ Stephens,Stylish but Lacking in Durability and Comfort,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1M5TR45FAAEGN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CF1SLGHC,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 10, 2024",Size: 9Color: Brown-06,Verified Purchase,"I was initially drawn to these loafers for their great color and stylish design, and at this price point, they felt like an absolute steal. However, after putting them to the test, I realized they’re more of a quick-fix option than a long-term investment.  Here’s what stood out:  Style: These loafers definitely deliver on looks. They’re sleek, fashionable, and photograph beautifully. If you’re shopping for something to wear for a photoshoot or a special occasion, they’ll do the job.  Affordability: The price is hard to beat, which makes them an attractive option if you’re on a budget.  But, here’s where they fall short:  Durability: After just my second wear, the tassel on the right shoe began to unravel, and I had to super glue it back together. That’s not something I’ve ever had to do with a shoe before, and it was disappointing.  Comfort: These shoes aren’t the most comfortable, so I wouldn’t recommend them for long wear.  In summary, while they’re stylish and affordable, the quality and comfort leave much to be desired. If you need something for a short-term use or a specific event, they’re worth considering. However, if you’re looking for durability and everyday wear, you might want to explore other options.",

WesleyG,I think they run large,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JCOMBK4KNRD1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CF1SLGHC,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 10, 2024",Size: 9Color: Black-05,Verified Purchase,I like the design. Normally i wear a 10 or 9.5 occasionally. Originally got the 10 and it was huge. Exchanged for a 9 which i thought was gonna be tight however the fit well. But about a half inch to long. Can't wait to wear these with a suit.,
