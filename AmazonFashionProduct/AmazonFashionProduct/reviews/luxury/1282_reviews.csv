If you are looking at ordering it, you probably already like the style and are halfway there. It isn't the truly beautiful hand embroidered design of a traditional outfit like this - but the design is still done well and doesn't look like it will peel or have any issues.  The pants have an elastic waist which doesn't look great BUT you also do not see the waist with the top on so it doesn't matter at all what it looks like and it does make for a comfortable wearing experience. No worrying about it being tight on the waist or any issues with wearing them for a full day.  Casual enough to wear for something less than formal but dressy enough to get away with wearing it for a special occasion too.",

Fit I have broad shoulders but not broader than your average man at least I don't think they are. I felt like Herman Munster. I couldn't get both arms in. I measured it against the woman's top I had taken off. Different widths, but not that different. The way it's sewn there's not enough should room and the arms are small. Yes, I know men's and women's sizes are different. It's not my first time at the rodeo, but I've never been this far off before. It's not cut well at all. I bought a 3x but I don't think a 4x would fit. There's no size on the bag or in the garment that I could find. It's highly possible this is the incorrect size. Doesn't make a difference though. The size won't fix the material quality.  My brother used to wear sets like this one all the time when I was little. I thought they were pretty and he always looked so comfortable.
