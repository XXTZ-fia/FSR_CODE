I ordered the 33” and 31” and ultimately chose the longer ones because they fit over my thick-soled sneakers, which is what I wear them with most. The reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5 is because I ordered the same size in Navy and as you can see in 4th pic, they are far longer than the black. That is something I read in another review and I will likely reorder the Navy in the 31” length and hope they’re right!
