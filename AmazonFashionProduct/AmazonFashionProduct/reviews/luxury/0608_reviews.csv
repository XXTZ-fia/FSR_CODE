The material is soft and lightweight, making it super comfortable to wear all day. The fit is true to size, and the design looks just as good in person as it did online. It’s versatile enough to dress up or keep casual, which I love. My only issue is that the fabric wrinkles easily, but it’s nothing a quick steam can’t fix. Overall, it’s a great set and totally worth the price!",

High quality in fabric and seams- thick so I'm glad it'll be warm w/out coat needed & I can layer a lightweight shirt underneath. However- important to note- the shirt needs to be long & loose enough to cover the top of pants, because they a lil bulky & pulled up high.)  I initially ordered two L's in Black and Brown, but the size didn't fit my thick (5'4 size 14/16.) I reordered an XL & giddy when the pants fit perfectly (high waist for comfy stomach coverage w/out sag.) Sadly, the jacket was too tight and fit like the original L that I'd received the day b4. Took it off & saw an ""L"" not ""XL"" & yes I could put it on, but couldn't of closed it over my wealth up top. So bummed that I couldn't use it for my flight the next morning and that's why I'm not rating this review at 5.  Note- At close of this review, I'm reordering the Black & Pink in XL's & hopefully they're packaged correctly. The brown was kinda ""different"" and so I'll pass on it.",34
