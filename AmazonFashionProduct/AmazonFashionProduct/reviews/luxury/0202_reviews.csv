The print , the craftsmanship , the quality , everything is there . I am 5.10” 256 men with a belly . I ordered 3x and it fits perfectly . The only issue I have , which is not a big deal at all , it is slightly shorter then i would like if i don’t tuck it in . Well , with this kind of shirts , you dont wanna do that . But also it should be considered that i have a belly and if i loose that , it will be perfect fit . It came in a vacuumed bag . As soon as i took it out and ironed , it came to life . Ironing is very easy . It even have hidden button closure . Well done . It feels almost silky , good quality material . I am very happy with this shirt . Got so many compliments when I wear . Well worth the price tag .",

Perhaps if I played guitar and was Prince it would be right for me, but as it is, this is a little too much.  If you are thinking about the shirt, it's quality and workmanship are excellent, the print is quite vibrant and nice looking, and if you feel you can pull off something like this it will be a great choice I am sure - it's just a little too much for me.",

I washed it and it seemed to be a bit softer but the colors were still perfect.  I found this shirt to be true to size and it is very comfortable but there were many threads I had to cut off of it which surprised me for a shirt at this price point but it was a very easy fix to snip the threads. I can imagine wearing this shirt for a special date or party but its not the kind of shirt I would consider for a truly formal occasion but that is subjective. Overall its a great shirt. I think this is a beautiful shirt and I believe it will also be a long lasting shirt that will not likely fade when cared for properly.,
Saad Y.,Beware of this shirt I received mine with ugly white line,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CV856XUPJZNT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CDDKBCBP,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 5, 2024",,Verified Purchase,When I received the package it didn't look anything wrong with the shirt but when I opened it I realized when they made it they made mistake when they first made the shirt and they left an ugly white line at the lower middle of the shirt right in the middle of the black line of the buttons I added pictures to see I am returning it for another shirt replacement and hopefully the new one will not have such a thing I also added in the pictures screenshot of the shirt description to see how different it is from the one I received I also added closer pictures of the uneven white line I am just glad the shirt was for me and it wasn't a gift to someone in which of course I would gift it packaged. If you decide to buy it make sure you open it as soon as you receive it also keep in mind because it arrives compressed inside a package the fold marks would not go away at your home iron you have to take it to a professional press machine first to get the fold marks away before wearing it for the first time. I also saw other people complained about the colors which is also true if you look at the yellow in the picture I took it's not as the same gold yellow they showed me in the picture. I hope this review is helpful,

It's about 2 inches short in the body (made in China) compared to average US sizes.  The XL sleeves are equal to a 35-36"" length. If you're 6ft or more then the XL will barely be enough.  The fabric is soft and the stitching seems better than some we see from overseas. It's not dress shirt level but appears adequate.  It's a bold pattern but runs slightly small in length, width and height so I can probably only wear it once. If it shrinks at all in the wash then it'll be done.  It came vacuum packed and looked like a flat little board at first.  Ideally it needs to be 10- 15% larger in all directions to match normal US sizes.  Sturdier material and thread would help also but the overall first impression is it's fine other than running a bit small.",

Pros: Stylish Design:  Many reviewers admired the gorgeous patterns, noting that they drew numerous compliments. The designs are retro, luxurious, and ideal for events or outings. The patterns are vibrant and make a statement, whether worn casually or for special occasions. Comfort and Fit:  The fabric is soft and true to size, with a comfortable fit praised by multiple buyers. Perfect for warmer climates like Florida, where the lightweight material is ideal. Fits well across various body types, with sizes ranging from medium to 3XL. Versatility:  Suitable for church, dinners, dancing, or even everyday wear. Several reviewers mentioned wearing these shirts for events, casual outings, or special occasions. Durable Material:  The material quality and stitching were highly rated. Reviewers in Mexico highlighted the excellent fabric and tailoring. Cons: Breathability:  One reviewer noted that the fabric lacked breathability, which might not be ideal for extremely hot or active environments. Occasional Delays:  Although unrelated to product quality, a reviewer emphasized their satisfaction with timely delivery and proper packaging, indicating potential concerns if expectations aren’t met. Varied Use Cases:  While suitable for most events, the shirts may feel too bold or casual for formal settings unless paired strategically. Overall Impression: These printed shirts are a standout for those who enjoy bold, unique patterns and comfortable fits. They are versatile enough for casual and semi-formal occasions, offering great value and style. Minor concerns like fabric breathability may arise, but overall, these shirts deliver both quality and compliments. :)",

This just a really elegant design and I have to say it's been a long time since I got so many complements on a shirt I was wearing. Dance obviously can be a pretty physical activity. That's to say that this shirt was a bit on the warm side. Not serious though. I can really work up a sweat and I made it through the whole dance (three hours) and still wasn't too hot.  This was very comfortable to wear and had three buttons on the cuffs making for a perfect fit for different size wrists. Oh and the sizing was spot on. Received exactly the fit I was expecting.

He tends to prefer preppie styles, so I was surprised that he liked this.  He said it was very 80s-90s, and it does remind me of the kind of shirt guys wore in the clubs in the 90s, sort of a Versace look.The fabric is a blend of 98% polyester/2% spandex, and is soft and has a sort of flow.  The cut is similar to a man button down business shirt, but the soft fabric and ornate design give it a very different feeling.The design on this shirt combines a sky blue background and intricate patterns in gold, white, and black.  The front of the shirt is patterned with chains, scallops, and fanciful, curved, leaf designs.  The back of the shirt is white; it has a large golden and black chalice with a lion’s head on either side, pale blue Greek Key designs, more of the gold chains and leaves, and more.I’ll admit it; this isn’t exactly my style, but my son really loves it.  He’s right; it does have a very old school, vintage feel.  And though it is far from his usual style, he looks great in this shirt.  He has pale skin and dark hair and eyes; the colors are flattering to his coloring.My son is just under 6’ tall and weighs about 200 pounds.  He has a broad chest and shoulders.  He usually wears a size 44 jacket; he likes his clothing a little loose, for comfort.  I ordered him a size XL shirt because the size chart said the chest measurement was 45.7”.  This fits him the way he prefers; with a little extra room.",

The fit is cut nicely for his masculine build, the quality of the material is nicer than most, it is very comfortable for him to wear on those long days of being in town and around people (we live quite rural and going to town does tend to be an all day deal) and it goes with various and many style types. I would say that the price of purchase is totally worth it and my husband looks fabulous wearing it.",

coloboho,Loud shirt but it makes you stand out for sure,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JNLHGCKSTDPV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CDDKBCBP,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 16, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Multicolored103,,"Every eye looks my way when I walk in the room with this shirt on. I have never worn something that as drawn as much attention to me. The material is soft and thick. I would not necessarily say it is comfortable like a silk shirt, but it is soft. More than anything the material feels thick and quality.  In my opinion it is a little bit on the pricier side, especially because it has limited use. I can't really wear this shirt to work, or for golf, and I have not found a blazer I like with it because it has such a bold pattern. But fashion aside, this shirt is definite quality and the right wearer of this shirt will love it.",
