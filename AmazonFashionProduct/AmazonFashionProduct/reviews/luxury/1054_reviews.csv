AmazonCustomer,Simply incredible 🥰,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUID8F2DZ0DBB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNSVM39F,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Color: Black&tortoiseLens Color: Black&Gradient Brown,,"These sunglasses blew my expectations out of the water! They're truly oversized, comfortable on my face, incredibly well-constructed, and completely block the sun.  They don't come with a case but there is a carrying pouch and a cleaning cloth. The build quality is phenomenal, better than glasses I've paid twice as much (and more!) for and so very stylish. I can't recommend these highly enough: these are a STEAL at two pairs for less than 30 bucks!",
Aurora,Work well but heavy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCF9YY7VNNAX9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNSVM39F,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: Black&tortoiseLens Color: Black&Gradient Brown,,These are definitely oversized glasses. They cover your eyes entirely and are very heavy duty. The quality seems very good. They are a bit tight right now to open but will probably loosen over time. Keep in mind they are heavy though. If you do not like heavy sunglasses on your face these may not work well for you. These are a little heavy for me. I tend to not like sunglasses that are too heavy but I do like oversized because I want to cover my entire eye in all directions. I received the black and the brown. The black is regular shaded lenses and the brown has a pinkish brown to light gradient so when you use the brown it brightens things up a little bit. I prefer the darker ones because I always feel like the brown gradient doesn't block the sun well enough for me. These are also a little tight on my face since they are so thick. I'm not sure if I will feel comfortable wearing them for long periods of time. I tested them out for a little bit but I'm not sure if I really like them long-term. They are very pretty and very fashionable looking. They also come with a clean cloth which is pretty cool.,
