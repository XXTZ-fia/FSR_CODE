I clean it after every single use to make sure it lasts and nothing sticks, but it was kind of a pain and used to take long because I'd wipe them down and not everything came off easily. I tried using these brushes and things came right off! I was using sponges and wet paper towels before, so now I don't have to keep using that and just put a paper plate at the edge of the grill to catch everything I brush off. Makes my life easier.
