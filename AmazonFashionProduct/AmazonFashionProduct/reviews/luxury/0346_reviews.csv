It has a nice texture and sheen, giving it an upscale appearance without the ethical concerns of genuine leather.

Comfort: The straps are comfortable to wear, whether on my shoulder or as a crossbody. I appreciate the adjustable length, which allows for a customized fit.  Durability: After using it for several weeks, the handbag has held up well with no signs of wear. The stitching is solid, and it maintains its shape even when filled.

There is an adjustable strap on the outside, which allows the purse to be worn as a messenger bag or a regular purse, as well as a handheld strap in. se one doesn’t want to use the long strap. I also love the little deigns on the outside bottom corners. It makes the purse look even nicer. The bottom has little feet and a hard base, which is great if one needs to sit the purse on the ground.  I do wish this purse had a back pocket on the outside because it is a bit annoying to have to open the entire bag every time I need to get my phone or keys, especially given the fact that every time one opens the bag, one needs to go through the process of unclamping the purse to access the inside.

I like the secure front clasp, though it is a little difficult to work when the bag is empty. Roomy 2-compartment interior with small side pocket. The only thing I don’t care for on this purse is the material used on the inside. It looks okay, but the feel comes across as cheap (like a vinyl).

NorthernGypsyBlog,"My New Favorite Fall Handbag – Stylish, Versatile, and High-Quality!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RETMEZB512B6Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D73P82JT,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 20, 2024",Color: Black,,"This particular handbag has quickly become my new autumn favorite, and I couldn’t be more thrilled with my purchase.  When I first ordered this purse, I was a bit apprehensive because there weren’t many detailed photos to give me a good look at what I was buying. But the moment it arrived, all my doubts disappeared. I was instantly smitten!  The purse features four gold feet on the bottom, which is a fantastic detail that not only adds to its elegance but also keeps it standing upright and prevents the base from getting scuffed. Inside, it has two pocket dividers—an absolute necessity for me. I tend to carry a lot of essentials, and having these dividers ensures that everything stays organized and easily accessible.  The material is a thick, high-quality faux leather that feels incredibly luxurious and durable. This bag is built to last, making it ideal for everyday use, whether I’m heading to the office or out for a casual day. It's spacious enough to hold a tablet or a water bottle, yet the size is just right—not too large, not too small. The design is effortlessly classy, with a texture that adds a subtle touch of sophistication to any outfit.  The clasp took a little getting used to—I initially thought it was a simple snap closure, but it’s actually a button you press to unlock. It’s a unique feature, and now that I’ve gotten the hang of it, I find it both secure and convenient. I also appreciate the wide, adjustable strap. As someone on the shorter side, I find this feature incredibly helpful in making the bag comfortable to carry, whether I’m wearing it on my shoulder or across my body.  If there’s one minor flaw, it’s that the hand strap is smaller than it appeared in the photos, which means I can’t carry it on my wrist as I’d hoped. However, this is a minor issue for me and might not be a concern for others. The versatility of this bag more than makes up for it. It can easily be dressed up or down, making it suitable for any occasion—from a day at work to a night out.  Another aspect I love about this handbag is that it’s crafted from cruelty-free vegan leather. It’s always a bonus to find a product that aligns with my values without compromising on style or quality. I know some people worry about the scent that can come with new faux leather bags, especially when they’ve been packaged in plastic. Yes, there was a slight chemical smell when I first unpacked it, but I simply let it air out for a couple of days, and the smell completely dissipated.  This handbag has quickly become a staple in my collection. It’s stylish, practical, and perfect for the fall season. Whether you're heading to work, running errands, or attending an event, this purse is a versatile accessory that will complement any outfit. I’m absolutely in love with it and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a chic and functional addition to their wardrobe!",2

Ellie N,Cute Wide Bottom Handbag But Fragile Top Handle Suddenly Broke Off,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HLXNVCGPXT6F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D73P82JT,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 10, 2024",Color: Black,,"PROS: I love the trapezoidal shape of the purse. It has a roomy, wide bottom. I can set it down and it won't fall over. It is not too small and not too big - good size for me. It feels smooth to the touch. The black color makes it easy to match with any clothes color. It comes with a white storage pouch. Plus, it has no toxic chemical smell.  CONS: A day after I wrote the review and was getting ready to put my stuff in the handbag to use it, the top handle of the handbag broke off. The ends of the top handle are not sewn onto the purse but only inserted in their respective slots -- as you can see in the photo I recently took. The two ends of the top handle only had a small and thin circular piece of foldable PU leather attached to them -- as you can see in two of the photos. Even after I tried to re-insert the ends back into their respective slots, as soon as I picked up the handbag but the top handle, the two ends of the handle fell out of their slots and the top handle broke off form the handbag. I was only able to use the longer strap that had clip-ons to carry the handbag since the top handle broke off.",12
Mad Max,Looks nice but several weird glitches,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TLIDST1M68C5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D73P82JT,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 10, 2024",Color: Black,,"3.5 stars.  This has the appearance of a higher end purse.  But my goodness it has a lot of problems.  At first glance the feet seem like a nice feature -- but they don't work. They don't actually touch the ground. Whether it's empty or full, it flops over to once side, or falls over.  You have to push the clasp really hard to get it to close, basically smash the purse each time.  There are no zippered pockets.  It smelled really really bad upon arrival. I had to rinse it off and leave it outside for several days, to air out.  The liner is nice, and the overall construction seems fine.",2
Eats Chips,Lovely bag with quality finishes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RYOVHFEZRCUM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D73P82JT,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 6, 2024",Color: Brown,,"First off, I have to admit that I am not a woman who enjoys switching purses. I tend to buy one that suits me and can go with many outfits and I wear it into the ground. It's always a black one. The brown color of this bag is very pretty. The faux (fake) leather is good quality. I think it can fool most as it doesn't look like ""pleather."" The finishes are high quality: - four metal button feet to protect the bottom of your purse and keep it upright when you place it somewhere. - magnetic clasp has an extra locking feature for extra safety (see video to see how it works). - the spring clips for attaching the shoulder strap are really nicely shaped and high quality. See picture close up. - quality and even stitching throughout. - lined interior is well sewn and fits the bag perfectly. Stays in place and doesn't get in your way. - interior is divided into two equal sections and the back section has a slip pocket for quick access to wallet or whatever you access the most. - can be used as a handbag, with the hand strap. Or it can be used on the shoulder with the adjustable strap. At full length it lands right on my hip and I am 5'7"". The strap is not long enough to use this over the shoulder as a cross-body. - the 4 bottom corners have a cutaway design element that adds interest to the design.  I have asthma and pick up on smells right away. I didn't notice anything off-putting when I unpacked this bag. So it didn't need an off-gassing period. As a matter of fact, I smelled it just now and found it interesting that it smells like real leather. This just adds to the credibility factor. Lovely bath with quality features, especially at this price.",26
La Chat Cerise,"Terrific, versatile medium-size handbag UPDATE 11/01/24",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OEOEOD0CX16R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D73P82JT,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 6, 2024",Color: Grey,,"*Update Nov. 1, 2024: I too am addicted to handbags. I have a whole bunch of them, in the quest to organize myself ""perfectly."" I normally switch purses out every couple of months or so because I get bored. I have *not* had the desire or need to switch out of this handbag. I have the black and the gray/taupe. The only switching I foresee is switching to the gray/taupe come spring. This handbag is just that good. I originally wanted a bag to carry in the crook of my elbow, but I've started to use the longer strap on my shoulder, and I love it. Comfortable fit, and it frees up my arms. I can't recommend this bag highly enough. Thanks.  While the gray handbag is described as gray, it's actually taupe. I like taupe as well as gray, so I wasn't terribly bothered, but thought I should give a heads-up about this.  The bag itself is beautiful in its simplicity. As you can see from the Amazon photo, it has a short carry handle that you can hold in the crook of your elbow, which is the main way I plan to carry this bag. It's a flip top with a button closure. The hardware on this bag is beautiful. The faux leather is thick and has a pebbled texture. There are 4 metal studs on the bottom of the bag. It also comes with a removable, adjustable shoulder/cross body strap.  Inside are 2 equally large compartments. The lining is light-colored, so you don't have things getting lost in a black hole. There is a very large slip pocket on one wall of the bag. The divider down the middle of the bag makes it easy to organize the contents. It is large enough to carry all my basic needs and then some, including a water bottle or umbrella.  On the design: it's all about folded (faux) leather. With the folding and the corner cutouts the bag has a kind of origami feel to it, if that makes sense. It's unique and charming.  This handbag is pretty much the ideal size for everyday. It's cute and roomy. I like it so well I just bought the black one. Thanks.",
Spiderbaby,From a Purse Junkie,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VPAIV4J3TJT5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D73P82JT,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 3, 2024",Color: Black,,"I have a confession to make - I'm addicted to purses. While some ladies may have a shoe obsession, my weakness lies in handbags. I've got a million of them, but I can't resist adding more to my collection. I tend to do so seasonally. This one is going to be my new autumn purse.  When I ordered this purse, I was a bit nervous because there weren't many pictures available to give me a good look at it. However, when it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. I liked it right away!  The purse has four gold feet on the bottom, which is a nice touch to keep it standing upright. Inside, there are two pocket dividers, which is a must for me. I tend to carry a lot of stuff, so having some separation is key.  The purse is made of thick faux leather, making it durable and perfect for the office. It's large enough to fit a tablet or toss in a water bottle, but not too big. The style is classy and the material feels high-quality.  The clasp was a bit tricky at first, as I thought it was a snap. It has a button you push to unlock, which is different but easy to figure out.  I appreciate that the purse comes with a wide, adjustable strap, as I'm on the shorter side. The only downside I found was that the hand strap seemed smaller than in the photo, so I couldn't carry it on my wrist. It's a minor issue for me, but might not bother others.  Overall, I love that this purse can be dressed up or down, making it perfect for any occasion.  I read lots of reviews and I often see complaints with scents. Yes, of course, a faux leather handbag packed and stored in plastic is going to have a chemical smell for a short time. My suggestion is to air it out for 2 days before use. This typically solves the problem if you have a sensitive nose.",9
