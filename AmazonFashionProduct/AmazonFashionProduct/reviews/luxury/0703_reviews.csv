Very sturdy and rolls like a dream. It's very unique which makes me love it more! If it had a red interior I would die of happiness.,
Glin M,Excellent,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LC88QL0BIQFL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DG5KJJ3B,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 17, 2024","Size: 26""+20""+12""Color: Blue/Black",,"There's nothing to not like about this, unless you just can't stand the rivets. It rolls easily, it closes securely, it turns away water to a reasonable degree, and it's perfectly sized for long trips for 2.",
SC,Appealing design,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Q1OR4N7W3XUV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DG5KJJ3B,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 17, 2024","Size: 26""+20""+12""Color: Blue/Black",,"I really like the look of these luggages. It is not quite your average luggage design. It is roomy and fairly light.  If you are a heavy packer like myself, the check in luggage will probably be good as a long weekend/short trip (3-5 days). The smallest carry on can, in my opinion, be used as a work briefcase depending on what you do or how much stuff you carry.  I do not know the longevity of these luggages as I just got them and have not used it enough. Overall, they seem to be a good set.",2
LG,Awesome Luggage!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20788YOFLARXA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DG5KJJ3B,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 30, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"I purchase these suitcases randomly hoping they were as nice as they look online. They are definitely everything you're expecting, so long as you ordered the same brown on black, as me I suppose! I received a beautiful suitcase along with a mini suitcase inside. Both items are made of a soft and very elegant type of exterior. The locks are supposed to be TSA compliant and the belt looking attachments are magnetically secured. I think this is an awesome set for the price and quality. The exterior fabric seems tough enough but I'm not sure I would check it into an airline. This is a bag I will take with me on road trips. Still absolutely worth the price! Beautiful luggage, as you see in the pictures. Very decent quality (if you want this type of bag to do survive air travel then you can expect to spend 10 times the price). Overall I would say a great bag to have, sturdy and secure. If you're concerned about scratch marks on the exterior fabric then I wouldn't check it into an airline. But for the price, how can you say NO?",6
Levi,Straight out of movies in the 20s,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LU8LVM0Q9R2H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DG5KJJ3B,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 5, 2023",,,"The quality and craftmanship was better than expected. No loose parts, seals pretty well. Got a couple pockets. Rolls smoothly and has a matching carry on. Nice to see a unique luggage in the carousel once in a while",
Yuri Mora,Cutest Luggage Ever,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YBBDO04W1HSZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DG5KJJ3B,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 10, 2023",,,"I absolutely love this luggage!! The luggage is so pretty, and the color looks gorgeous. It's not heavy at all and fits so much! It does have a combination code to open both big luggage and small carry on. It also has latches on both sides. I cannot wait to travel to put this to good use!",
Don R.,Surprisingly better than we expected,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DANXU7VYCPXQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DG5KJJ3B,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 2, 2023",,,These are actually fairly well made luggage. We were expecting low quality but were pleasantly surprised by the decent build and durability. The wheels roll very well and the handle is strong. My wife loves the look and style and is happy to use this set while traveling.,2
LSS,"Beautiful, Elegant, Rolls Well",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3A5VD6GDPJYZP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DG5KJJ3B,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2023",,,"I was surprised how beautiful and elegant these two pieces look. I'm almost afraid to travel with them, well check them in with the airlines. I got the large one because on my last trip, the airlines broke the bottom of my fairly new hardside 26"" piece of luggage.  For me the small bag is small for when I travel as I don't want to not utilize my full allowance with the airlines. I like that the small bag has a combination lock and not too happy that the large one requires a key, which I believe I could easily loose or misplace. It's not like a house keep where you can get extra copies. The small bag has a shoulder strap and a strap that lets you attach to the 26"" bag.  I would have liked the larger bag to be a little larger as I the kind of person who gets the bags that can expand by opening a zipper section. I will have to see when I actually use to travel if I can fit everything I need inside.  The large bag reminds of the old-fashioned steamer trunk and it actually opens while standing and stays supported where my other previous same sized pieces of luggage would haven fallen over. I've wheel it cross the carpet in my house and it rolls smoothly in all directions. I feel like I should be going on a round-the-world cruise with this bag. Will get back when I get up the courage to check the bag in with the airlines and report on how it fared: I worry about the straps that go around the suitcase: I can imagine a baggage handler at the airport grabbing on to the straps to lift the bag and breaking and tearing them off.",
