I got multiple compliments on the street just walking to the party (about the look and the fit once I told them it was straight off amazon), and many compliments at the party. The sleeves were a tad short but I'd prefer that than being too long.  The material is very soft almost suede-like.  Outside pockets are sewn shut and fake, but there are two inside pockets, and a nice inner material pattern. The only surprise was that the buttons were not the ones in the picture, and instead some kind of a reddish bronze with horses or something, and did not match the jacket. They were also sewn in upside down... but overall it still looked fine. There's no way the gold-leaf pattern will hold up over time, but it's great for looking flashy at parties.  Definitely worth the money for me.",3
