I ordered a small and the shoulders shrug up when my arms are down or moving, so it's not constructed super well. I'll be returning it, but if I were to keep it, it would be to use as a workout shirt, not for casual wear.",
Julie,No idea if it’s a dupe but I like it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10GX02W5N6NYA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BLY4R1GS,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 4, 2023",Color: B-blackSize: Small,Verified Purchase,"I haven’t ever felt the skims shirts but this material is like athletic material. Feels the same as some of my workout tanks. It’s definitely stretchy and a little cropped. If you want a full length tee this is not what you’re looking for. I like this length though for the gym, it just slightly overlaps with my leggings. Lightweight and  breathable. Not sure i would wear it outside the gym though since it just feels like athletic clothing. Also I wish they made XS, I like my tops to fit pretty tight especially around the upper chest and neck area and this is just a little looser than I like personally.",
