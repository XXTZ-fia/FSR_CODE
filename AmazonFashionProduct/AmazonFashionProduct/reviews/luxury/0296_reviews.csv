Bret,"Too small, not good fit",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R230B0YHH7XSSU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B9WF6JVS,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Color: Olive Green/Dark Green,Verified Purchase,"I purchased these sunglasses for myself, male in college, hoping they would fit as it said for men or women in the description. When they arrived, they look just like the images; however, they were much smaller than I expected. The lens were very small and looked to small for my face which is already not very big. These glasses were also too short in the length and barely reached my ears as well as were too small width across my face. The color liked good tho and was what I was wanting and the quality was exactly what I was expecting for the price, nothing too special. I love the style and wish they were a little bigger then I would wear them. I would recommend that if anyone is worried about these being too small either way on you, then probably not buy them.",

If you have a big head/face, these will look like you are wearing kids glasses. The box they came in was very nice and the glasses included a nice drawstring pouch and lens wipe cloth. The lenses are NOT POLARIZED, which I knew when I ordered them, so note well. The lenses are not dark so they are great for overcast days or low-light situations where you still want some eye protection.

The frames feel robust and very solid.  The lenses are brilliant! They are very clear and have a smooth transition from darker at the top to a few shades lighter at the bottom so you can still see your phone or punch in your debt card pin number at the gas station.

The manufacturer sends a storage pouch for them too so the lenses and frames will stay not only clean yet unscratched through months and years of use.I do have a wide head (as my eye doctors have stated when ordering prescription glasses every year or so).  Thank goodness I started wearing contacts!  That being said, I feel these are a bit tight to wear long-term.  They squeeze the side of my head pretty hard.  I think I look great in them (from the side and from the front) so I'm continuing to wear them in hopes they ""spring out"" a bit and get a tad looser.  If they do, I can see these being one of my pairs of sunglasses for the next few years.  My fingers are crossed that they do.I may get impatient and slowly start ""spreading"" them out a bit in hopes they will be perfectly comfortable then.
