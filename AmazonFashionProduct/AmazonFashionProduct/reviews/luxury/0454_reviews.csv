I can kind of be worn different ways I found… And I like that it has a visor to keep the sun out of your eyes. But this is just a versatile wonderful hat!  I did not have chemotherapy or lose my hair but I have chronic Lyme disease and my hair has been falling out and turning drastically to where the parts are starting to separate dramatically and my hair is just length and hangs there. But the hat helps keep my head a little bit warmer and covers up the scraggly, Large parts in my hair. Looks really great!  I actually ordered two more. One in the light denim and the other gray one!  Update....Got my other 2 hats and contacted supplier numerous times to find out what king of 'foam' material is in the brim of the hat and noone will tell me...CAUTION!@",8

So I bought this cap to start preparing for hairloss. It's a light cap, almost like a t-shirt material, and will be good for fall and spring, but too light for winter. It's very soft and flexible. It doesn't hold shape, so if you're looking for something structured this wouldn't be the choice. It is designed to fit low on the head and cover all of a bald head, unlike some hats that only come partway down the head. It fits snugly so it won't shift around even without hair to hold it in place. I like this hat and I'm sure I'll wear it once my hair is gone.",3

I only wore it a couple of times and the elastic in the back stretched out to the point that it became very loose.  I contacted the seller.  They won't do anything about this even though it was never even washed.  They told me it has to malfunction within the return period.  Now the hat is unworkable unless I decide to take it for alterations and have new elastic inserted.  I don't think this was very good customer service.,7
