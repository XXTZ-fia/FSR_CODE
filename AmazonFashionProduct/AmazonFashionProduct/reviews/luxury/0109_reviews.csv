TMLR,Soft and comfy pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROTGEQ0ZVPIS9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGGB8BSL,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Carbon,Verified Purchase,"I really like these joggers, they are incredibly comfortable and soft. The length is perfect, I’m 5’5 and the size medium joggers don’t need to be hemmed and they aren’t short. The pants look nice too, they can be worn when going out to run errands, etc. Barefoot Dreams puts out very nice, well made clothing and these joggers are typical for their high  quality, comfortable and attractive clothing., The cost is reasonable when you consider the great product you’ll be buying. I have Barefoot Dreams clothes from 2020 and all look just as nice as the day I bought them.",
Chris,Not as comfortable as cotton,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21E2Q0OMTLIET/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGGB8BSL,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 1, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Carbon,Verified Purchase,I wore this on a 6-hour plane flight.

She wears them to lounge around the house or visit friends.  No regrets buying them at all.",4
Christopher Hurdman,Seems short?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVKIR1QC3H6WA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGGB8BSL,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2022",,Verified Purchase,I have longer legs but I never order tall in any ring — I am 5’7 and 150 lbs postpartum and I got a Medium which fit but are too short. They ride up my calves and when I’m seated the pants come up my ankles defeating the purpose of a warm sweatpant. Also not very flattering in the butt. For the price I want more.,2

Best to get ahead of time since they sell out.  I'm 5'5"" and 120lbs.  Bought size S.  They fit perfectly.  I have long legs for my height but any longer and these would be a little short.  The hit my ankle with just a little bit of puff at the cuff.  I'd prefer if the fabric folded over the ankle cuff more, but they are fine as is and the fabric is heavenly.",8

I would recommend looking at specific garment measurements for any item to get your best fit. I purchased these track pants in my usual size and the fit is great.

JA,Sizing review that should help u.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1001F79M50US4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CGGB8BSL,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 4, 2019",Size: SmallColor: Sea Salt,Verified Purchase,"I am writing this review only b/c when I was reading the reviews prior to purchasing this I didn’t find them helpful. I ordered the cozy chic track pant. I am 6’0 and weigh 145lbs. I ordered the small in sea salt. They are not see through (someone had said they are). They fit my length perfect and have a roomy look to them at ankle like the model does in the pic on amazon. The waist band is slightly tighter than the cozy chic wide legged pant, but not tight at all. Just more fitted. The same goes for down the quad/thigh area. Slightly more fitted. I would order a small again. Hope this helps. Most recent review on BFD track pant- don’t dry them n dryer cuz A LOT of the cozy ends up n ur dryer lint AND the sea salt “white” color becomes very dingy after a few washes. I have all the other colors n BFD and this is the only one that doesn’t wash well.",42
