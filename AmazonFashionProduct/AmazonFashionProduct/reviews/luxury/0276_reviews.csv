I have two pretty major complaints, the first complaint is the drop piece that extends over the nose is plain, there should be some sort of jewel there, otherwise it just looks like a silly piece of thin metal resting on your nose.  The second complaint is that it's quite difficult to tie the mask tightly to the face and I feel like mine is constantly sliding down, even when the metal is bent and adjusted.  The only solution is to hold the mask tightly against your face and have someone else tie it in the back, otherwise the ribbon loosens before you're finished with the bow.It's a pretty mask overall and will make my costume more interesting, but I do wish I'd chosen another style of mask.",8
