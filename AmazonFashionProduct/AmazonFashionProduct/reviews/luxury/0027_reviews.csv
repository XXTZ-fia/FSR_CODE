The opinions expressed are solely my own with no input from either manufacturer or Amazon.  If you're looking to score a bargain on a ring box that absolutely hits above it's weight class, it's this one.  Build quality and finish is curiously good. It has a metal hinge, that's well integrated into the case and the construction is unusually clean.  The velvet covering is really nice looking and feels good to the touch. The blue looks real purty.  Ring fits secure and snug.  5/5 Easy recommendation. Great product at a great price.",

The fuzzy red felt on the outside even seems to extend into the white interior, giving it a rather uniform texture.  The ring slot is nice and tight as well as the semi-stiff hinge which holds extremely well.  Honestly, I'm super happy with it.  Not sure it'd go well with a piece of black jewellery, but anything crystal, gold or silver looks amazing against the powder red-and-white.  Full marks.",
