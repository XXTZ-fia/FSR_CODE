Lbyard05,"Gorgeous color, so bummed about the MAJOR flaw",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REIQ2FDYDFCKF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN4RMY58,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 29, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Apricot,,"Let me start off by saying this light cream color with the gold is an absolutely stunning mix. I’m on the edge between a small and a medium and I chose a medium and the fit is just fine. I would say if you were between the lines to size up. The fabric is beautiful. The gold chain has some weight to it and really is a pretty addition to the shirt. What I am so bummed about is the massive flaw right in the middle of the shirt. You can look on pictures two and three where I pointed out this line down close to the center of the shirt on the front and the back. While it does not feel like stitching I’m not sure if it’s a flaw in the fabric? Regardless, it stands out like a sore thumb and now I don’t think I’ll be able to wear the shirt because it is so obvious. Had it not had this flaw I would’ve given it five stars, I love it it’s beautiful, but it is what it is and therefore it’s a no from me.",14

It fits  across the bodice and the sleeves are long enough, which is not always the case for my arms. The only reason I took one star away is because when it arrived, one sleeve was missing the button at the bottom of the sleeve. Fortunately we found it in the package. If we had not, the blouse would have been useless as you certainly can't find that shade and type of button down at the fabric store. I love the chain at the neckline--it  makes this a special blouse.",

It just felt a bit boxy and wasn't particularly flattering on me. I'm typically between a L and XL, but I went with the XL. I didn't love the cut out that went across the front of the shoulders, it just didn't feel like that fit with the rest of the shirt.  The metal accent feels solid, and the shirt seems well-made. The silk fabric was comfortable. It is a boxier, cut with pleated shoulders. The shirt itself looks nice, but it just didn't look nice on me.",

It didn’t disappoint.  I ordered a size up from my usual size considering it’s a fabric that doesn’t have any give and my back being more muscular. It fits me like my usual size medium so definitely size up if you’re on the edge of the next size.  - the chain on the front sits very nice and isn’t heavy. It is hollow on the back. -the sleeves have stretch in the button string to close the cuffs. -I’m going to wash it on delicate’s. -it has shirt tails to tick it in. -the red is a nice deep red that doesn’t stand out too much for red.  I would definitely recommend this for a party, office party, family gathering.",17
