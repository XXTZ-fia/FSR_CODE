Mc,PROPER SIZE IS KEY!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMSPIF84TMGLS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074PCTGW5,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 10, 2024",Size: (30) DColor: White,,"Ignore the negative reviews. This bra is amazing and has been a Gossard bestseller for a long time for a reason! I own 5 of these in different colors! However, low plunge bras are no joke if you have large breasts, so ladies, go to your local bra shop and get properly sized or consult the Gossard website. I always used to buy 38D, and hated lingerie. I always felt like it was uncomfortable and thought I was doomed to boring bras forever until I visited my local bra shop. The gals educated me on proper bra care and sizing and got me into my proper size, 32G!!! In the photo, I am wearing a 36DD (not my size) but it was on super clearance that I had to take it. That's how much I love these bras! To piggyback on everyone else, the back smoothing is amazing and makes it so comfy, and I can wear this bra with so many outfits because of the plunge!",

I was surprised by how supportive it is for how light weight it is! Will consider buying again.",

I tried repairing it multiple times but each time the sharp underwire would just poke a new hole. Additionally the hooks in the front did not hold there shape after some time and began to bulge out in the middle. So sad because it’s a beautiful bra.,2

Usually wear a 32DDD and ordered the 32E which is supposed to be the same size. Sadly the cups are too small and it does cut the breasts under clothing. Granted if the clothing is low enough, it just gives cleavage.  Needed a measurement chart that translated better. Would love to figure out how many cup sizes I need to go up to get the proper fit. The band was way more comfortable than a higher band. Takes so much pressure off the shoulders and is very soft.  Update- Still want to love this bra, but definitely have an issue with falling out. It takes WAY more adjusting to stay in this bra than I have energy for. Dropping the rating as it hasn’t been wearable comfortably due this problem. I can start off totally in the bra, but in 30 minutes we’re in trouble.",2

The lace and the details are so beautiful.  I'm confused about the purpose of the lining on the outer 1/3 of the bra. I have pretty prominent nipples so those did not have as much coverage from the bra as I would have liked. It would have been great to have lining through the whole cup. The lace texture helps a bit, but you can always add the nipple cover things if needed. The cup runs a little bit big. I'm usually a DD but this DD was a little too large in the cup for me, so I'm going to exchange for a size down (cup-wise). The band was about what I expected size-wise. It was more supportive than I thought it would be. I love the underwire! Also, if you have breasts that are a little wider apart (I have ""east-west breasts"") and want some cleavage, this bra probably won't do it.  It didn't for me. The only other thing I’d change about the design is to give the straps some pretty lace details so that when you where tank tops you can see it poking through.",

I have a hard time finding bras that don’t dig into the outer sides of my breasts but this is perfect. The only down side is that it sits closer to my neck than in the pictures so the straps sometimes show in anything wider than a crew neck.,3

I don't want to take it off. So sexy, so sweet, such a perfect fit. I got the 36 DD and it's amazing. I needed a plunging bra for a wedding where my bridesmaid dress has a wrap top.
