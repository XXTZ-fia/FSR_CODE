Amazon Customer,Smaller than described.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I2B0NA5WN4EI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKL75Z5L,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Size: 6.5,,"Shipped fast, arrived in colorful pouch. I was excited by how pretty this item is.  I measured my wrist as directed and ordered the 6.5"" but it was actually much closer to 6"" and I couldn't even get it to latch on my wrist it was so small. Very disappointing.",
MsSushiQ1,"Great Style, Cool Brand",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EK010MH8YCF2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKL75Z5L,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 17, 2025",Size: 6.5,,"I love this watchband style of bracelet. I had one from Zara that I wore for years but unfortunately it finally broke and was unfixable. I was thrilled to give this one from Electric Picks a try. I’m a female with a 6” wrist and I ordered this in the smaller size. The fit is perfect. I’ve been wearing this for at least 5 days straight now, only removing to bathe. I removed one star because the gold tone is much darker in person than shown in image description. I was worried this would be a dealbreaker, but I’ve grown to love it - but still felt it worth mentioning. I was also not crazy about the brand logo on the clasp, but turns out it’s really difficult to see unless viewing up close. I found a lot more info about this brand Electric Picks from their retail website. The company started from stringing (vintage) guitar picks onto a bracelet, which as a guitar musician, I thought was really neat. I received this through Amazon Vine at a discounted price in exchange for my review, but feel the full price is fair - it’s would I’d expect to pay for a good quality gold plated piece. Electric Picks doesn’t have a store here on Amazon, but after doing a search for them, there are some really cool pieces available for sale including a bezel tennis bracelet I love. I do recommend this bracelet, but keeping in mind the gold plating does run dark.",
Cristina,"Beautiful, high quality bracelet",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P33M5X3B4PIA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKL75Z5L,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: 6.5,,"Love this bracelet- size is perfect and the design is really elegant, stylish, well-done and looks like a fantastic dupe for a designer bracelet. The gold tone looks great. Feels comfortable on wrist at same time substantial. Would totally recommend if you like the style!

Lbyard05,"Fit perfectly, beautiful, looking, very comfortable on",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KZ1P8HZYTJ5H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKL75Z5L,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Size: 6.5,,"I’m actually shocked how much I love this new bracelet! I have a 6 1/2 inch wrist and ordered the size 6 1/2. This fits me no problem and I actually have just the tiniest little bit of room on my wrist, so it’s not skin tight either. The gold is a beautiful shade. It’s not too brassy or orange. This is extremely comfortable on with the shiny curved links side up and more of a matte flat look on the inside that is against your skin. Although a tiny bit difficult to put on and take off by myself, it can be done. Great price point, very nice looking, definitely recommend!",

I do have very small wrist and although this is not uncomfortable on, I do wish I would of went up to the 7"" for a little wiggle room. The quality is very good, and the gold is not too dark or have a brassy look.",

It has a sturdy clasp, a beautiful shine to the gold and hasn’t tarnished! I loved that they have 6.5” options for smaller wrists because the 6.5” fits beautifully! It glides on the wrist well, doesn’t pull arm hair and is a beautiful accessory. I’ve worn it daily for about 2 weeks now and it hasn’t gotten dull or green! This one is a win!!!!!!!",

My daughter says it feels nice when she wears it and she loves the way it looks. The clasp is effective and very secure.

I always shop early for birthdays and other celebrations, and this bracelet will be the perfect gift for my ""minimalist"" daughter. Her birthday is not until June, but I could not let this beautiful bracelet go!  The bracelet is lightweight because it is 14K gold-plated over stainless steel. However, it is sturdy and durable and will resist tarnishing. I looked at similar bracelets, and this one compares favorably in quality and price!",
