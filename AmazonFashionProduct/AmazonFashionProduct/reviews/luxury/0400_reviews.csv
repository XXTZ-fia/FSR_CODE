JESS,I ❤️ Wacoal,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MJ50WXJ93HMJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D26435V4,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 6, 2024",Size: 40HColor: Hot Pink,Verified Purchase,"Finding a bra that is beautiful, well made( awesome quality) and actually provides support...is a rarity. Every bra I've purchased from this company NEVER disappoints! I'm a VERY busty woman. My bras can not be found in stores in my size. I love that this company provides so many options for style and colors. Most of my bras only came in white, nude or black. Highly depressing and basic. Now I have an array of colors and styles. Makes my heart full of joy! These bras are not inexpensive but I've tried other companies. They don't compare to Wacoal. I literally have the perfect. I recommend this company whether you are busty or not. Fantastic lingerie. Spend the money and be ready to be impressed. Also they have sales regularly on their site and Amazon. Thanks!",
Amazon Customer,Comfortable bra,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FDET7FTB1Q3H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D26435V4,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 2, 2024",Size: 42DDColor: Hot Pink,Verified Purchase,Nice fit,

elladeer,Too much coverage and too wide,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RN52IQJC7B408/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D26435V4,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 1, 2024",Size: 32DDColor: Cappuccino,Verified Purchase,Fabric feels ok. Pretty lace design. Cups are too separate for me and too far back on the side. Projection is good but it's a tad loose at the top near the strap. Gore is flat and feels comfortable. Shape mismatch. Gonna have to pass on this one.,4
Vic,Excellent Quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C53DBR9C6BYJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D26435V4,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 13, 2024",Size: 34DColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"This is lightweight, but it is made extremely well.

Angela F,Full bust hero!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BXSI6YT1BC05/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D26435V4,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 24, 2023",Size: 34DColor: Cappuccino,,"Finally!...A bra that’s actually pretty for larger busts! This bra is unlined so doesn’t add extra weight to my boobs and the lace is so pretty! It sits flat across my chest and the underwire provides slight lift which is great for support. Also, provides great coverage, finally I can bend over without breast spillage! The lace is slightly stiff, however very thin, so unlike most lace bras, you the lace is almost seamless under shirts. It is however, seamed, so that’s the part you can see under t-shirts or button downs, but it’s not too bad. True to size chart. The bra is so comfortable that I forget I'm wearing it! I've washed this a dozen or so times(in a lingerie bag, air dry) and it is holding up beautifully!",6
Cindy Near Tampa,My new favorite bra.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WB42YEGO6YJH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D26435V4,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 2, 2023",Size: 32DDDColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I was skeptical - but this is *the* bra I have been looking for. I am small framed (size 32 band size) with a large, heavy chest and need definite lift and separation.  Also wanted something well-made, but minimalist looking and without padding. This hits every note! I almost subtracted a star because it *is* pricey....however, when you're a hard-to-fit size and something (finally) rings your bell, you become quite forgiving! For what it may be worth to you to judge sizing, I am 5'3"" 128 pounds and bought the 32DDD.",10
