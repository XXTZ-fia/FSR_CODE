This two-piece satin pajama set, complete with a sleeping mask and scrunchie, truly exceeds all my expectations in terms of comfort and style. The material is silky smooth and feels incredibly luxurious against the skin, akin to much more expensive sleepwear brands.  It is true it is to size. The fit is exactly as described, which is a great as it can be hard to find well-fitting sleepwear online. The elastic waistband on the pants ensures a comfortable fit without being too tight, and the top drapes beautifully.  The quality of the fabric and the construction of the pajamas are superb. They've held up wonderfully in the wash without any noticeable wear, pilling, or loss of the silky feel. The included sleeping mask is a charming touch, enhancing the overall sleep experience by blocking out light effectively, while the matching scrunchie is gentle on my hair.  If you’re looking for a set of pajamas that offers a touch of indulgence at a reasonable price point, this SATEEN set is definitely worth considering.

One minor drawback is the tendency of the fabric to wrinkle fairly easily. However, this is a small trade-off for the luxurious feel and comfort the pajamas provide. With a quick steam or iron, the wrinkles can be smoothed out effortlessly.  Overall, this luxury pajama set is a wonderful blend of indulgence and practicality.",

BettyPageBombshell,Set comes w/ awesome extras: eye mask & scrunchie. Soft and silky and comfy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U7YFEUCOS1R8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CX1W1LMK,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 29, 2024",,,"Okay, so this PJ set is just gorgeous, y'all! It is so soft and silky to the touch and they look so cute! I got them in the white and they would be perfect for getting ready before a wedding or as a bridesmaid gift or for a pajama party or movie marathon/ sleepover with your besties!  I've always been a no-fuss flannel pants and a tank kind of girl, but I've always dreamed of having fancy elegant PJs like these, and now, finally I have my dream PJs at last!  I'm 5'4"", 170lbs, bust is 38D, waist is 34.5"", shoulder is 16.9"" and hip is 44.5"". I got this set in the Medium size and it fit me very nicely. Not too fitted or too loose, just perfect. About one size too big on me, just to give yo9u some idea of the sizing, I could have sized down if I wanted it super fitted and tailored, but I like my PJs to have a little more room, they're just plain comfier that way IMHO. These are true to size. Sizing chart is accurate, so be sure to follow it.  The set comes with a few nice little extras: Along with the lapel button down top and shorts you also get a nice silky eye mask and a silky scrunchie. Both the scrunchie and eye mask are made of the same matching material as the PJs.  The fabric feels like it is good quality and it is thick enough to not be see-through at all. The fabric is silky smooth and light and breathable. I got these in white and I was worried that they might be thin and transparent but I'm glad I was wrong. I'm pleased to report that they are NOT see-through all, except maybe if you were outside in very strong sunlight, but for most scenarios you'd be wearing pJs in, these are not at all see-through!  They are lightweight and breathable and super comfy to sleep in. I can't wait to use these this summer!  The shorts have an elastic waist with a drawstring closure. The piping is very nicely done. They wash well and don't lose their silky, almost minky, feel. They don't lose thier softness with repeated washing and they don't wrinkle super easily either, so that's a plus.  Now I want them in every color in the rainbow!  Hope this helps somebody!",3

Turning around in bed is almost uncomfortable because I stick to the bed as I try to turn. And I roast in these things, there's no breathability what-so-ever. I am getting used to the face mask a bit more, but even that is uncomfortable. It soft on my face but the band is too thick, it bothers my ears while I'm laying on my side with it around my head. I had to stretch it out a bit before putting it on after the first time, because it was too snug against my eyes and was almost giving me a headache from the pressure. Now, the reason I gave it four stars instead of less after all these complaints is that they are soft and kind of comfy wearing around as lounge pjs and you could still stay warm and still have the comfort of wearing shorts. The eye mask is also a great size, it covers my eyes fully and sits well once its stretched out good.",

Not sure I'll use the sleeping mask, but it matches and looks cute.  The pink is very flattering on olive skin.  The buttons are a bit tight when trying to close, but the up side of that is that they stay closed!",

Well, I immediately took it off. It DOES give static cling really badly. That was going to be my deal-breaker, and now it is. To the donation pile it immediately went.  Original review - 3/12/24: I didn't have high hopes for this fabric, but it's better than I expected. It's not quite as static-y as polyester satins tend to be, but I also have only worn these when it's been moderately humid, so I'm not sure how these would act in a very arid climate. If they turn out to be horrible during a different season, I'll update my review, but they're soft against my skin and I only got static when I tried the shorts on over cotton leggings. Wearing them as intended they were fine.  I typically take a S top and M bottoms, so I ordered the M and they fit as expected - bottoms are nice and comfortable at my natural waist; top is large and the shoulders hang about 1"" off where they should be. (About one size too big, as expected.)  I love the terracotta color, it was as expected/pictured...but maybe I was even pleasantly surprised at how much it hit the target. I've been disappointed more times than I care to recall with clothes purchased here, so it was refreshing.  I hate how this cheaper material doesn't release packing wrinkles. As of 3 washes and line-dries, those are major permawrinkles and there doesn't seem to be much hope of them coming out anytime soon. Steaming only released the wrinkles from the washing, not from the original folding for shipping.  All in all, for under $20 (at time of purchase/review, March 2024), they're an ok little pj set. I was able to purchase these through Vine for a discount, but I could recommend them for maybe bridemaids gifts or something like that - if you took a lot of time to get the wrinkles out.",

It fits well and looks decent. It is trying to be silk but is not silk so I usually throw in the wash after each wear as it will be wrinkly after wearing it to bed.  Even though it is shorts and a tshirt, the material kept me warm at night.",
