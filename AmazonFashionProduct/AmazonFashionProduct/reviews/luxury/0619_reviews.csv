The quality seems quite good.  It looks so classy with the diamonds and THEY DO SPARKLE!  The hands are luminous in the dark and show up quite well.  I love how easy it is to see the day and date.  I have an Invicta watch which I love but the date is difficult to see, so I love that this one has a very easy to see day-date.  It is very good quality for the price.  Not sure yet about accuracy but it seems fine.  The bracelet is very easy to size, by removing a few links and it comes with the tool to do it which works easily.  You will not be disappointed.",

The band is adjustable with the included tools but I didn't have to adjust it so not sure how easy that is. The band looks really good to and doesn't feel cheap. Really nice watch.,

Shlebby,A little gaudy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XXFTOGDX288Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBQ41N17,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 28, 2024",Color: men blue watch 89,,"I completely misunderstood what I was getting when I ordered this. I didn’t realize that the watch face was lifted in the shape of a faceted diamond. Because of this it juts out from the top of the watch and makes that part of it more prone to scratches, so I don’t love that. The blue is a really nice color and the accents on the internal face do look very nice. The gold is not as deep and rich as it is online in photos which was disappointing. The watch itself is quite large and can look gaudy on someone who doesn’t have really big arms or hands. While I think this is the middle of the road product, you really can’t beat the price for how nice this looks, other than the faceted face. Overall, I am conflicted on how I feel about it but if you want an affordable gift for someone, I would recommend it for that but I don’t think I would buy it for myself personally.",2
Wolo P.,Decent looking inexpensive watch,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGZ345DTQ1GC6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBQ41N17,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 27, 2024",Color: men blue watch 89,,"I've been a watch collector for 20 years, and have more watches than I probably should. I own very expensive time pieces, and inexpensive quality pieces as well. I always like to try different brands to see if there is a good value product out there. This men's watch by OLEVS, is a decent looking time piece, but I don't think I would categorize it as tremendous value. I think it's better described as you get what you pay for. Don't get me wrong, there are some things to like, some things that may be subjective, and a few things to dislike. I'll start with what I didn't like. The operation for setting the day and date is not perfect. Setting the date worked ok, but the day seemed to get stuck on Wednesday for me. I had to push the crown back in, pull it back out all the way, rotate the hour hand 24 hours to get it to change the day, push the crown back in, pull it one step out and then it finally was able to change the day. I tried it just for the sake of checking twice, and change the day again by pulling the crown one step, and once again it got hung up on Wednesday. That doesn't bode well for the manufacturing quality, and was a little disappointing. The second thing that I didn't care for was the gold paint on the band. You could clearly see that it was kind of a half job, because the gold doesn't go all the way around the link. I am absolutely certain that it wouldn't take much wear and tear for that gold to rub off. It was half coming off already, and it was brand new. I do like the clasp, and the general style of the band however. The face is easy to read, and a nice classic style. Another thing I didn't really care for much, which is subjective of course, is that the crystal on the face of the watch has some kind of prismatic effect to the design. It's not a flat piece of glass, and the ridges cause this strange distortion effect from certain angles. You can kind of see it in my picture as well. Some may like that look, but I would have preferred a flat piece of glass. All in all, it's a decent watch for the price, but I wouldn't say you're getting more than you pay for.",
Greysmoke,"At the price, except for the miserable manual, it would be hard to improve on this.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2E564W2FYH19W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DBQ41N17,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 25, 2024",Color: men blue watch 89,,"This is the 3rd OLEVS watch I've received for evaluation. I've worn them daily for the past few weeks. This particular example arrived just today, but it's mechanically identical with the others I've received, so here goes.  The Pros: - Super high quality **for the price you pay.** Compare them to other drugstore watches at this price point and you'll see what I mean. - Accurate timekeeping with a reliable quartz movement. - Great design and a lot of choices in terms of dial design and color across models. The one I chose has a blue dial and silver bezel along with a Roman numeral dial. I'm not a fan of an alternative that uses crystals for the hour markers, but that's a personal choice. - Quality of assembly and packaging is first rate, and I've included numerous detailed photos.  The Cons: - The manual is a joke. It makes little to no sense, it's poorly written, and mostly useless. I've photographed a few pages so you'll get the idea. It also fails to share any of the watch's specifications. (The lug width, BTW, is 20mm.) - The watch is packaged with a small tool for use in sizing the steel bracelet. The instructions attempt to describe how this is done, mostly failing to make sense. Because I lack experience, skill, steady hands, and patience, I'm not able to do so myself.  If you can't size the bracelet yourself you can take the watch to a jeweler who can do it in two minutes. But they may charge you -- or at least expect a tip -- unless you're a known customer. Even a $10 tip is 25% of the purchase price of the watch. If you buy the watch, have a plan for having the bracelet sized. My solution? I removed the bracelet and replaced it with a brown leather strap I already had. You can see how it looks in a couple of pictures. To be clear: the bracelet is no harder or easier to size than any other bracelet. I just don't have the skill to size it myself, and the instructions are of no use.  In summary, the watch looks good and keeps accurate time, which are perhaps the most important considerations. If you're thinking of giving the watch as a gift, the packaging is suitably impressive. Most importantly, this is a very inexpensive watch that looks like it costs more. Please keep in mind that **this is a very low cost watch**. At the price, except for the miserable manual, it would be hard to improve on this.",

I've had it for about a month now and have notices 2 things. 1 the bracelet clasp is not great and 2 DON't press the buttons when you're adjusting the date/time. Be delicate with/replace the bracelt clasp, it's just made of a thin cheapy metal material. If you press the buttons when the crown is pulled out you will change where the base reset of the watch is, ie it will not return all of the chrono-dials to perfectly straight , and you'll have to press the bottom and top buttons over a shousand times to get it back into place. Annoying, but what do you excpect from a cheap chronograph. Over all, if you're careful, it will serve you well.",

The clasp isn't very solid and will release sometimes and I have had it fallen off and hit the floor. It survived which was a surprise. But it also got misty after a busier shift. Had to remove cause fog was covering face.,2
