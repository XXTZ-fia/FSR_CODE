And it came today. So I unpacked it and put it on. I know clothes you order online run different but this is ridiculous. I’m 6/2 and a half so reading the reviews I figured I needed a long size. But this coat goes right above my ankles. The sleeves are also very long. I take a 34-35 shirt sleeve. And there about an inch to long. Other than that I like the coat. So I’m going to try and return it. And maybe order a smaller size. I hope this was helpful.,3

I only got it today, so I haven't even actually worn it outside, but it fits and feels good (that 10% cashmere makes a difference). My only real complaint is that the sleeves are too long. But, I expected that. I am 182 cm (6'), 114 kg (250 lbs) with a 132 cm (52+ in) chest. Often, my shoulders are very uncomfortable in XXL (2XL), so I order XXXL (3XL) so my shoulders can move without binding and I can inhale without my clothes restricting me. That's very dependent on who makes the clothing item, of course. In this case, I ordered the 56R. I am very glad I did, because the 54R would not be comfortable on my shoulders (especially after I put on a shirt and tie, or some other clothing). I do NOT understand why manufacturers think a big chested guy must have super elongated arms, so the sleeves are about 5 cm (2 in) too long (hit me at my knuckles, looks silly). To look good I will have to pay to have the sleeves taken in (maybe have to move some of the sleeve buttons?). The full length hits me mid shin, which is perfect. The quilt lining seems fine. Again, I haven't actually worn it outside with proper clothing on underneath, so I reserve the right to modify this review later, ha ha. But, first impressions overall very good, very nice looking, especially for the price.",3

It was double bagged and came with a hanger. Stitching is very solid and material is of medium weight. It was very wrinkly so I hung it on the shower rail and steamed it a few minutes and let it dry, and it was much better. I tried it on, with and without a jacket and it was fine, arm length a little short but very little with a jacket under it. The length fell blow my knee, waist and chest were perfect. I am 6' 2"" 220 and it is very hard to get a good fit. The lapel seemed to have two hang lines and that is when I noticed that it had tiny glitter on the collar, shoulders and lapels. The chest pocket had an annoying wrinkle and when I stood in a mirror I could see why. Part of the tacking had been cut and when I put my hand in the pocket I could see it was from stress of weight in the lower pocket that pilled directly from that point. What I got was a return, someone had worn it and returned it. The middle back was slightly lighter in color and had the beginnings of little pills all over it and has a little shine to it. I was disappointed that I got a used coat but an hour of brushing and pulling out grey hairs with a tweezer and it looked much better. My wife and daughter say it makes me look slimmer and love the look. For the price and look, well worth it considering I may only wear it a dozen times a year.",7
