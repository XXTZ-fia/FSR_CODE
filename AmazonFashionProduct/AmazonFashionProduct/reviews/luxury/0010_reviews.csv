I have purchased so many robes that did not fit, were too long or short and this is the perfect length. I am 5’’6.5” and the length is midi, below the knees above the ankles.  The thickness is all weather friendly and the cut is fabulous,  not tight, not loose. It is simply tailored well,  for example there are inside ties on both sides of it so it never shows more than you want. The third tie side is attached and has an elastic band that is very figure flattering. . The perfectly pressed collars lends the air of a suit or smoking jacket. I cannot recommend it more. Please never run out!.  The fit is true to size. Buy it! You won’t regret it.",2

Meli,"Extremely well-thought out, luxury robe!!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11RB2HBG2IO7O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF4FGKY4,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 29, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Sapphire,,"This is a high quality, luxurious mulberry silk with french seams. The materal is absolutely dreamy. It looks a bit wrinkled in the photos because I had just taken it out of the package, but the wrinkles soften out when you wear it.  I’ve always wanted to be a robe girl, but never found one that I truly loved. There were always quirks…some aren’t soft enough (I prefer natural materials) or I’d always lose the waist tie.  They really thought of EVERYTHING with this robe. It has attached ties in all the right places so you can be as modest or as revealing/sexy as you’d like.  Even the main waist tie is attached, so it’s always conveniently there when you need it. I don’t know about you, but I would always lose the waist tie with my old robes and then they were useless.  This is machine washable!!! Which is not always the case with silk. Just follow the instructions provided.  It even has pockets - and the pockets don’t cause a bulge on your hips. The pockets also seem very reinforced and built to last.  It’s true to size. I am a size 6-10 in women’s jeans and I purchased a medium in this robe. It fits perfectly.  This would make an amazing gift for yourself or a loved one. It comes in a nice silk gift bag and has even has a matching silk scrunchie. It’s made by a small woman-founded biz.",10
Reviews I'd Want My Kids To Read Before Buying,"Lovely, But Arms Are Wider, Not Fitted",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R9V49TGKBUHK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DF4FGKY4,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 29, 2023",,,"First, let me say that I have reviewed quite a few 100% silk robes over the years and I am not a person of great means, and so my standards are very high for silk. I believe that all customers deserve the very best review possible, especially as to quality justifying cost, and so I always evaluate every robe as if it were going under a microscope, so that anyone reading my review will have the best chance of making an informed decision on this product, With that said, let's get to the review of the Tara Sartoria 27 Momme silk robe with fitted three-quarter sleeves.  For the good points, this robe shines, because it quite literally doubles the average ""feel"" of thickness of silk robes without actually doubling the thickness, giving a remarkable illusion as to thickness of the fabric. It's not twice as thick and is actually only slightly thicker than my next-thickest robe, objectively, but it feels very thick, double the average and quite a bit thicker than my next-thickest robe, due to the weave of the silk. In feeling the robe's fabric for thickness, the first thing I notice is that it's not the super-fine tightly-woven ultra-sheen silk you see on a very light camisole and some pillowcases these days, which is often also used in thinner robes. It's a thicker thread, which is still tightly-woven, but not quite as tightly woven as on other robes. And this gives the robe a very thick feel, slightly less smooth but also thicker as compared to any silk robe I've ever tried (including in high-end stores, where I never even considered buying one, but wanted to try one). Truly, this feels very thick to the touch and on the skin. It has a bit of weight, and it's very pleasing to have that feeling on the skin. Objectively, this is thicker, but not double-thickness. Subjectively, it feels so much thicker and so much more luxurious to the touch and on the skin that I can't help labeling it as a much thicker robe, because of how it was woven.  This robe also shines as to the style they selected when choosing a slightly darker outer appearance and a slightly lighter inner appearance. The silk fabric is of a right-side/wrong-side design, again because of the way it's woven, and this smoother and slightly darker side contrasts with the slightly less smooth and slightly lighter side to give an effect of making the fabric appear to be a double-layer fabric, when, upon close examination, it is still only one layer of silk and a true single-layer fabric. That's also very pleasing to my view, although it does make for slight variations in color on the interior of the robe that everyone should be aware of. Personally, I find that the slight color variation on the interior adds flare and character to the silk, truly matching the description of ""artisan"" silk, but some will want to know that it's not perfectly uniform on the interior. As to the exterior, it is uniform in color and perfect as to the finish of the silk fabric, as you'd expect.  So you may wonder why I'm giving four stars, not five, on something I clearly find very pleasing. And for that explanation you only need look at the photos of the sleeves in the listing-photos. The robe in the photos is a fitted robe, with fitted sleeves that come down the arm to between the elbow and wrist. That may well be how a size small looks, but that is not how the robe they sent to me looks. I always buy a larger size, because I love a robe that overlaps about eight inches down the front, and so I always get an XL. The sleeves on standard size XL are something I am very familiar with, along with the sleeves on sizes Medium and Large and 2X and 3X and even 4X, all of which I've procured for friends and relatives over many years of buying gifts. And the sleeves on the XL I received match the 3X sleeves on a dear friend's robe purchased only last year. I have an XXL from a company that specializes in fitted-sleeve satin robes for women. They made one in a pattern I thought was spectacular for my husband and I knew he wouldn't mind that it was not technically for men, and it was perfect for him on a lazy evening, with nice wide sleeves and an abnormally long-length. That robe, size XXL/2X, has sleeves that are smaller than this robe's sleeves by over three inches in circumference. Simply put, this robe is not fitted in the sleeves.  I should specify that every measurement other than sleeve-circumference, all compared between this robe and other XL robes, is very much in line with a size XL satin or silk robe. Overlaying this robe on two other silk robes of size XL, from very popular brands, I found that all other measurements of body-circumference were very similar between the two robes, from the neck down to the hemline, but the sleeves on this were much wider than on the other fitted-robes. I cannot give five stars to a fitted-sleeve robe that has wide-sleeves, because it's not advertised accurately. This robe has wide sleeves, as compared to my other XL silk robes and as compared to all standard robes I compared with this. It's simply a wider sleeve than you could ever label as being fitted. The listing photos show a fitted-sleeve robe and the sleeves are much wider on this. It's not fully a kimono-sleeve, so wide that it would fit any size from small to 5X as a standard kimono-sleeve will, but it's wide enough for a size 3X fitted-sleeve, which is too wide to ever be called fitted. It fits very well and looks lovely, except for the sleeves being so wide, rather like bootleg jeans or a large-sleeve cardigan with the large circumference than you might be expecting based on those listing photos.  I truly believe this to be a very high quality robe and I find it very pleasing to the touch and to the skin, such that I do recommend this, but only if you want a three-quarter wider-sleeve robe that is not as wide as a kimono-sleeve. Call this an intermediate-sleeve robe, not quite a kimono-sleeve but definitely not fitted-sleeve either. The length is perfect and the fabric is lovely and the stitching is very well done and I found no significant flaws. There are variations in the fabric as with some silk robes, but nothing I would call a flaw, and the robe is truly lovely. I would recommend this to anyone seeking a slightly wider sleeve who does not wish to go all the way to a kimono-sleeve. For a fitted-sleeve, keep looking. Good luck to you and I hope you find the perfect robe. The cost on this at the time of review is quite good, $140 per robe, and the quality is good enough to justify the cost.",2

The silk is thick yet light weight and very smooth. The sleeves are 3/4 length and perfect length on my wife’s 5’5 frame. Easy to hand wash and steam. The color navy is dark and looks great on any skin tone. The belt is sewn into the robe so you won’t have to worry about slipping off and loosing it. My wife is wearing a small (her usual size) and it’s perfect on her. The fit is slim and skims her body so i suggest ordering your usual size.,5
