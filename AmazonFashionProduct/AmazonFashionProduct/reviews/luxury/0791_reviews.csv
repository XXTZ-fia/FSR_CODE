I received this purchase in TWO days. Packaging pristine … fur folded to the inside and fluffed right up after shaking out as instructed and I also fluffed it in the dryer with dryer sheet. Beautiful white color as described. Absolutely NO odor or smell of any kind. This beautiful and fun fur DOES have two pockets AND SEVERAL very sturdily constructed clasps for closure. I have read MANY reviews about this jacket and this is my experience. If you’re considering THIS cute jacket GO FOR IT. I have absolutely NO regrets. Photos are from a Taylor Swift themed brunch.

It was also warm enough to not need a whole winter coat on with it either. So a win win.. The only down side is the poorly attached loop closers on it. I wasn't able to close it completely because one fell off completely and another is hanging off. Nothing that can't be fixed with some needle and thread real quick though.,2

The faux furs are beautiful. It does take time for them to fully fluff up.  But, I didn’t do what the product designer suggested about how to fluff up the faux furs.
