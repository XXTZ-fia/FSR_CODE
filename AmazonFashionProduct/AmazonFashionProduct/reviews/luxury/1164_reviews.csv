That is, the one I received is a scarlet, not the crimson shown. Just wanted to share this for those like myself whose skintone needs a more blue-based palette. You can see from the dressy scarf ring, which has a faux ruby, that the scarf leans very much towards an orange-red. It’s a gorgeous scarf though. I already had it in the soft pink variation and the quality is great. Will make a nice gift for someone who can wear vivid scarlet.",

There are no snags or pulls, and the edge hems are flawless. I can't imagine sewing this well with such a silky fabric, but this scarf is so well done. I would be proud to present it to anyone as a gift- it rely does look like a much more expensive piece. It wraps my neck twice, and tucks in to create a lovely, loose drape that is so flattering! It also works beautifully as a light shawl for coolish summer evenings. It is too much fabric to use as the type of head wrap I was thinking about, but if you wear it as a head scarf/neck wrap, as worn by women for various cultural reasons, it would be the perfect size.

I own many, many real silk scarves and this is not made of silk but of a 'silk-like' material.  I do not appreciate false advertising.  Even the label on the scarf does not indicate it is made of 'silk'; it only has the three letter initial of the company name.  I know not to order from this company anymore.  I had bought another orange scarf from this company as well and it too is made of 'silk-like' material.  The very cheap price should have cautioned me not to think that I could get my hands on a quality silk scarf for a cheap price.  You get what you pay for.",18
