It's very thick, plush fabric, and it does come all the way down to my ankles (I'm 5'6"", 175lb, and got an X-Large). It wraps all the way around me, with nice overlap, and wicks away damp wonderfully. I've had terry robes that are silkier, with longer yarn-loops, but this is much thicker and more absorbent than those, and a wash with a generous bit of fabric softener made it come out plush and soft. No snagging in three months of regular use, either. It's almost the perfect winter bathrobe.  The one down-side is the belt loops. They're spaced for men, not women, and just don't come up far enough to put the belt around my actual waist. I'm going to have to add my own set of loops for that.  That said, the robe is, in every other respect, exactly what I wanted. Do be aware, though, that it _is_ heavy. This is a lot of cotton, and the weight matches the density. If you're looking for something light-weight, I recommend a Sioro cotton knit robe instead.",2

After reading many, many reviews, I took a chance on this one.  It’s a beautiful, well made robe that’s highly absorbent, and fits well.  At 5’5” and 153 lbs, their sizing chart suggested a large, so that’s what I went with.
