I’m 5’4”, 125lbs, and a small fits perfect with room for a light/medium thickness sweater underneath. I’m 34C and can close it all the way, but larger busts might feel a smidge tight. Sleeves are a good length and overall length hits just below knee. The belt is a good thickness to stay tied and lay nicely. Warm enough for winter in the south and love that it’s lined all the way through. This is a win - will be ordering in black and burgundy.",20

That was this coat for me.  It is thicker than I expected it to be, which makes it the perfect fall coat. It looks good with or without the belt. Although I love having the option to tie it closed if it gets colder when I'm out for the night. It held up to my international trip. I shoved it in a suitcase multiple times, wore it while walking around the city, and carried it a lot when it got too warm to wear it. As long as I hung it up at night it wasn't too wrinkled the next day.  BE WARNED: I am 5'4"" and it is a very long coat on me.
