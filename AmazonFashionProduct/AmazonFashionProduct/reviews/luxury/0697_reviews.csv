Hunter Mc,Genuinely surprised by the quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UO97K9K54H3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B748FW31,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 14, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Green,Verified Purchase,"Used this for a holiday party and got complimented on the look of this jacket all night. My brother paid triple the price for a very similar jacket at a department store. The fit was exactly what I was expecting, I didn’t have to downsize or upsize to account for it coming from overseas. The quality of the material feels great, and the look is top shelf. If I had to find something to complain about it would be the buttons on the cuff, they’re a little loose and jingly for my taste, but it worked out perfectly for the holiday party I used this at.  10/10 would recommend.",
Bella,Perfect for our outdoor New Years Eve wedding,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FXT5475T50QX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B748FW31,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Red,Verified Purchase,"Really nice jacket. Fit right, the velvet is rich excellant quality especially for the price. We were pleasantly surprised to be very honest. Needed to be steamed before wearing but thats normal. Not too heavy not to thin, my husband wore it all day comfortably. He got a lot of compliments on the beautiful shade of red. Not an orange red, its a deep yet bright red.",

Caleb G.,Nice for price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJBR14RX4N8DW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B748FW31,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 4, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Burgundy,Verified Purchase,"Quality is pretty good, fits a tiny bit slim. It is VERY heavy which is somewhat expected for the velvet-esque finish.  I could probably use it in winter on the east coast and be ok so fair warning for warmer venues.  I enjoyed it and color is good.",2

Brooke,Different Fit from other COOFANDY,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZGVKAOJRBFJL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B748FW31,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 11, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Red,Verified Purchase,"Nice jacket but fits a little smaller than the other ones I have gotten from the same brand. I ordered a large and it was slightly tighter in the shoulders from the other jackets I have from them. Might have been the thicker, velvet material this is made from but my suggestion is to order a size up.",

Doktor Fish,Unbelievable!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CMPXMB51P9AZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B748FW31,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 13, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Blue,Verified Purchase,"I took a HUGE risk buying this and I can't believe a such an affordable jacket actually turned heads the way it did at several events including a wedding. I'll be honest this jacket is poorly made and you get what you pay for, but buttons busted off, and there were strings hanging that needed to be cut off , but at first glance for a night you'll be the talk of the party and people will be talking to you and about you.",
