It fits well and is true to size. The reason for the low rating is one of the shoes squeaks. I have tried everything to fix it.

katiego,Not real leather,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30TD23S0A331H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BX67F8G7,"1.0 "," the United States "," July 1, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"Absolutely fake leather. Doesn't breathe or sculpt to foot, plastic feeling and terrible for warm weather. It seems there is a thin layer of real leather on the inside of the top, as well as the fringe (but not the cord). This really helps so that the top of the shoe doesn't rub your foot. But the edges rub, and the bottom of the shoe sticks to your foot like plastic. That being said, they are made in a wonderful shape - very wonderful fit for the foot. However, this simply is not worth the money. I've worn it twice and the fake leather is wrinkled and scraped with scuffs that are a lighter brown color.",12

From the very first time I slipped them on, I knew I had found something special. The chunky leather design exudes both style and professionalism, making them the perfect addition to my business casual attire. The platform lug sole not only adds a touch of sophistication but also provides exceptional comfort that lasts all day long.  I find myself wearing these loafers so often to work because they strike the ideal balance between fashion and function. The chunky design and quality leather give off a polished and put-together look that's perfect for the office environment. What's more, the platform sole not only elevates my height but also cushions my feet, allowing me to move around comfortably and confidently throughout the day.  Whether I'm rushing between meetings or spending hours at my desk, these loafers provide the support and comfort I need. Their versatile nature allows me to pair them with various outfits, making them a go-to choice no matter what I'm wearing.  I appreciate the attention to detail that ADAMUMU has put into these loafers. The craftsmanship is evident in every aspect, from the quality of the leather to the precision of the stitching. These shoes are a true testament to their commitment to providing women with footwear that is both stylish and practical.",6
