It looks great right out the box and wasn't far off from being to the right settings. Easy to turn the days and date to correct time and date. The look is more like an expensive gentleman's watch than a 38.90$ watch. Glad I bought it to wear out and when going to different places other than my old Timex I've been wearing the past 16 yrs or more. It's sent through many bands and batteries but gains about 3-4 minutes in a 6 month period. Hopefully this watch will keep the right time for me. If it runs as good as it looks then I'll be extremely happy with this purchase. Thank you for the great looking new watch. I've wanted a new nice looking watch for the past 3 yrs and glad so far that I chose this watch.,3
