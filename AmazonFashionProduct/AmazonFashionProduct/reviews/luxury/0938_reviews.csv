I wish they were that bright orange color but they are not. Only when you take a picture of them. The human eye does not see it the same way as a camera lense. But other than that they are AWESOME. One problem is the fact that they only come in narrow for my size. I usually wear an 8 but for these I ordered a 9.5 because of them being narrow. I also put shoe trees in them and it helped widen them a little. Plus they are more comfortable after being broken in. At first I wasn't sure I could wear these things but now I like them. For the first two weeks i didn't know how i felt about them. So break them in! Also the soles are non slip rubber...,2

The fit was true to size and with normal walk it did not get the ""top creases"" that you would sometimes get with some shoes.  If we would say 1 for the shininess of a matte shoe and 10 for a ceremonial super-shiny one, I would say this would land somewhere around 7, which is perfect for the business attire.  Overall, I would put this on par with my Paul Stuart or even Church's pairs in terms of craftsmanship, however the durability of the material is something that I will only be able to say in a year.

I remember them being in the $40 to $80 range...When I came across these, I could not pass the opportunity to get me a pair just for the sake of remembering old times...I'm glad I did...These are very nicely made shoes and look beautiful! The soles on these I would say that are appropriate for my age, kind of rubbery, flexible and slip resistant (not really for dancing). I love these shoes, but while I can still wear them comfortably enough, I kind of regret not ordering them in size 8. Ordered 8.5 thinking they would have been too tight on size 8.

I can wear it instead of black oxfords on most occasions. The medallion on the toe cap makes it a bit more casual but still very stylish. I typically wear US size 10 dress shoes so I have ordered 10. The fit is nice and snug which is something I prefer as the leather seems to stretch.  I would love to hear more about how these shoes are constructed though. The bottom of the sole indicates these are soles and the uppers are handmade but how are the soles attached to the uppers? Blake stitch? Goodyear welt? Glue/cement? at this price point ($180) I think this information would have been very helpful.  I sincerely hope that you will find my review helpful.,3

I tried them on for the purpose of reviewing them but got distracted by something else.  I ended up wearing them for several hours.  They won't replace my bedroom slippers but for dress shoes they're amazingly comfortable.  More significantly, they're really comfortable right out of the box.  Most dress shoes even if they end up being comfortable need some 'breaking in'.  I'm sure these shoes will only get more comfortable after a few wearings.These are legit gentleman's shoes.

This is real Leather, not thin strips, but solid. I inserted my foot using their supplied shoehorn and my size 11 foot fit perfectly inside the shoe. I am a D width and there was plenty of room and the toe cap was also had ample space for my toes. I am sure as I wear them (to break them in) the tightness when inserting my foot, will ease up (as the leather conforms to my foot). Let me state that there is no discomfort, they are just stiff as you open the shoe to insert your foot. I like the construction of this shoe as it shows real craftsmanship.
