You are better off buying a luxury spa robe from a hotel like Marriott or Hilton, and I know Marriott offers them at different levels - like super luxury Ritz Carlton ones for $300 and Westin or Marriott ones for same price as this.

You know, the two little ties that keep the robe together internally, keep it from gaping open as you move around. The external belt can’t do this by itself. I will have to get a white shoelace or something, cut it in half, and sew it in by hand. So that is annoying. I have never had a terry cloth robe without this feature. Design flaw.",
