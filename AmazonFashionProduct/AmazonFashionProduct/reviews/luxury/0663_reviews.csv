Many hotels have switched to the waffle light weight robes. Now when I spa I can bring my own. Many bathrobes are terry on both sides which is not my preference. I like the soft smoothness of the velour on the outside and the fluffy towel terry on the inside.After a moisturizing body scrub, you can just put it on without toweling off first. The robe absorbs excess water but leaves the moisturizer on your skin. I hope they  keep selling these as they are hard to come by and a good value. My last one similar different brand lasted for years. This robe has a little weight to it, but I prefer it over the fleece robes now being offered- they don't absorb well. This robe feels like quality to me just like a high end bath towel.",14

I was worried about fit since it's one size but it works for me. For reference I'm a women's size 16 or XXL, and I'm 5'2"". It closes just right on the top without spilling out but have room to spare around my stomach. It hits at my calfs and I like it that way. This is a definitely heavy robe so probably won't work for summer. My only observation is that it's not extremely soft (it's ok) but it is cozy. Hoping it softens up after more washes.",8
