The first time they were used the corner of one of the suitcases crumpled.  I contacted the manufacturer and was told that it was the airlines fault not theirs.  I was not happy but figured out how to use a hairdryer to pop the dent out.  For the next few trips I used the other suitcase that had not crumpled in the  corner.  My latest trip I needed to use both again and wouldn't you know it the same corner crumpled.  I feel that this is due to a manufacturers defect, they do not stand behind their product.  I personally will go back to TUMI and wish I had never wasted my money on a Bric product.  I was lured by the nostalgic design instead of staying with products that have taken a beating for years before they do break.",9

D.

It was AMAZING! It was basically indestructible, was easy to move, and was very sturdy. I like on one coast and my family lives on the other coast, so I am constantly traveling. Flying with Christmas presents, Mother's Day presents, etc. can be nerve wrecking because you never know how your luggage is going to fair. We got many good years out of the Jeep luggage and when it finally fell apart, I knew that I needed one just like it. I tried this one. Though the price point is WAY higher than the Jeep luggage was, it looked like it had the same design and checked all of the right boxes. And for the most part, it did! The luggage is sturdy, holds a great deal, is lightweight, and very easy to move. The only big issue is that it's not as sturdy as the Jeep luggage. After out first cross-country flight, the tan exterior was already scuffed and there was a dent in the outside. Everything inside was perfect, but the outside has definitely shown some wear and tear.",5
Dora L. McAlpin,Very Nice Suitcase!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FHRMIV3FOUDU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07PNQCNQR,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 23, 2018",,,"I have to be honest. I never would have owned a suitcase this nice or expensive, if I hadn't received it under the Vine program. So I am comparing this against the mid-price luggage I typically use. And, really, there is no comparison.  This suitcase is sturdy and rugged. But it also has some 'give', which helps to prevent damage. I've taken several trips with it, and it still looks brand new. The only bad thing I can say about the material is that it seems to be a magnet for pet hair and dust, and that really shows up on my black suitcase. Not a big issue, as it's a quick swipe to get it shined up again.  I love the double-decker interior, with zippered compartments to keep everything nicely packed.  The zipper is sturdy, and i expect it to last for years and years. The combination lock is a great feature.  The telescoping handle slides more smoothly than on any luggage I've ever owned. No hassle at all to get it up and down.  The wheels roll and turn easily, with very little effort, yet the suitcase is well balanced to hold its upright position. It is highly maneuverable, and easily glides through crowds. It's not quite as easy to lift, as it weighs nearly 12 pounds when empty, but it's worth that extra bit of weight to keep everything safe inside.  This is a great suitcase, and I love the classic look!",12
Mitchell,"Great looking, lightweight but static exterior and interior!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C61TK55QEPLS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07PNQCNQR,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 9, 2018",Size: 30 InchColor: Cream,,"This Bellagio luggage is very elegant and quite sturdy luggage. We are also very pleased with size and the compartments this luggage has. Extremely easy to roll (smooth spinner wheels) this luggage around and it does have an added TSA approved 3 numerical passcode code security lock.Very pleased with the lightweight and great look. The leather accents in pressure points look great and will probably weather nicely, however they are only in the front of the luggage and would have been nice to wrap around completely in front and back. The main zipper is covered with some rubber sealing material that will keep most water out if you get caught in the rain. I guess the biggest gripe I have with this luggage is that the cream colored plastic seams to create some kind of electrostatic friction when brushed against and it attracts hair from the floor and if you have pets this will basically have the same effect as rubbing a ballon on your hair and dragging it in the floor...it will pick up stuff you don’t need the luggage to carry around.",11

Ring-Wraith,"Heavy-Duty, Yet Luxurious Luggage",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA0HZLTZ21CEL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07PNQCNQR,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 13, 2018",,,"This is the first piece of ""luxurious"" luggage that I have ever owned. I mean I've never even owned a recognizable name brand of luggage before. So going from the bottom and straight to the top was definitely nice. The Bellagio provides the stylish look of absolute elegance, while at the same time maintaining a heavy-duty frame to withstand the harsh environment of travel. To begin with, this piece of Italian-designed trunk style looks very sleek and stunning. It's composed of a makrolon polycarbonate shell (no clue what that is, but it sounds impressive) and Italian leather trim. I have the black colored model with looks fantastic with the tan accented leather trim. It has a nice shine to it, but not too much that it looks glossy. They said that this thing was heavy-duty, and they didn't lie. It seems that the baggage handlers always try their best to destroy you're luggage, but so far this thing has held up really well to their constant abuse. The other great part about this luggage is how it moves so easily on the spinning wheels. It spins effortlessly in all directions due to the 360 degree spinning wheels. This allows the luggage to be easily pulled/pushed by the telescoping handle. The trunk comes with two separate level compartments between the top and bottom. These then zipper together and can be locked using the combination lock. It also has a TSA-approved key slot that they can easily open if they would have to inspect your luggage. Finally, the trunk also comes with a handle along the side so you can carry it by hand if you would need to. This comes in handle when carrying it up and down stairs or lugging it up onto your bed. So far I have found any negatives to this piece of luggage. Typically most things always have some sort of bad that comes with the good, but this seems practically flawless. You really do get what you pay for, and it's plenty worth it when it comes to this piece of luggage.",
David Bradshaw,Looks gorgeous and rolls amazingly,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBNR5YO324OC0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07PNQCNQR,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 4, 2018",Size: 30 InchColor: Cream,,"This is a gorgeous piece of luggage.  It has zipper on one side and the buckle onthe other side of the hard shell and keeps everything super organized and in its place.  It looks amazing!! it is so beautiful.  The leather edges just make it scream elegance.  It rolls perfectly and is super easy getting through the airport with it.  The lock was easy to set and since it is a TSA lock I don't have to worry about them getting upset about not getting into the luggage.  I really do like having the built in lock too, it makes it so much easier than keeping up with those little external locks and keys.The material is super high quality and I have really loved it. It is amazing looking and I feel super fancy with it.  I really hate even using it at the airport since I know it is going to get beat up and eventually not look so awesome.  But oh well, that is just part of life for a suitcase.In the end this is a super high quality suitcase that holds a lot and keeps it safe. It looks amazing and has built in lock which is super convenient.  Super happy with this",

The hard case is not hard but somewhat flexible, yet surprisingly strong- and unbelievably lightweight.  The wheels are the best I have encountered, they go where you want them to go, and do so easily, and the adjustable handle opens to a comfortable pulling size.  I am tall and appreciate not having to bend down to pull it. The leather touches are downright elegant.  The interior layout was designed by a traveling expert, because it is so easy to use and highly intuitive.  The thing which keeps coming back to me is how incredibly lightweight this luggage is.  I was amazed at how much can fit inside, and how organized everything is, so you can go straight to the desired items withou disturbing the rest of your clothes or toiletries. I am comfortable keeping some electronics in it as well, feeling that they are secure.  Overall, this is the best suitcase I have ever used.  So far, at least, there is nothing that I feel should be changed, and that is pretty impressive!",

The real leather trim makes it elegant! The suitcase has lots of space inside, it includes two zipped bags, and there is ample space in both the two bags and the suitcase itself. The spinning wheels work really well, and this suitcase is very easy to handle. Everyone in my immediate family travels a lot, so this suitcase will be shared. The outside zipper is substantial, and the lock is programmable thus your contents are secure. The telescoping handle works easily and well.

Was amazed by how much it can hold, enough for a 3-week trip in the wintertime involving sweaters, boots, and other bulky items. The inner pockets make this suitcase very easy to close, no more sitting on the lid and trying to force it to zip as I often had to do with other bags. At the same time it is light and easy to manage, even for a petite woman travelling solo. The shiny surface does become dulled during normal use as a check-in bag, but personally I found this insignificant from an aesthetic perspective, it still looks great. This might be more of an issue if you purchase the suitcase in a light colour (mine is grey). The suitcase goes perfectly with the duffel from the Siena collection, I got them in contrasting colours for some extra visual excitement!",8
