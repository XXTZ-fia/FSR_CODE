I received this item today and it smells awful, heavily soaked in cheap perfume and it looks like it was harshly used. If you can’t afford something and keep it don’t buy it. Anyway, it’s the responsibility of the seller to check items are in good condition but probably once a product touches Amazon hands all quality control goes to thrash. I hope to have a better experience in the future. I don’t recommend buying from this seller.  For reference I got the black color on a small size. Quality of product not that great.",4

This stole traveled well in a suitcase rolled up.  It was warm and looked great with my sequined 1920’s inspired dress and accessories.  It has two hooks that allow you to wrap around your shoulder without having to hold it.  The bottom hook wouldn’t stay but the top was enough to do the job.  It has pockets and is lined with a reasonably comfortable fabric.  it also looks great thrown over one shoulder if you don’t need your shoulders covered.  I had so many compliments.  Totally recommend!,

Felt like a queen.  Super soft.  It needs fluffing out the bag though.  The leather- like under side could be seen without the fluffing.  I'd go over it with a steamer to fluff the fir out the bag then let hang.  The under side is black and matches the fir color so no big deal.  It has POCKETS!  Which help keep it on your shoulders.  I chose to wear over one shoulder (Coming to America style (movie)...lol) so the dress could still be showcased.  It's long enough to go around both shoulders as well.  Beautiful piece to elevate any gown during cold months.,13
