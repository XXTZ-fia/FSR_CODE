Amy M.

I definitely shouldn't have. The seams rip so easily, especially under the arms and on the collarbone. I washed it when I got it and noticed holes days later in the areas mentioned. We stitched them back up and they haven't ripped again, thankfully. Hoping no rips show back up (I haven't washed it again), apparently all we needed to do was sew it back ourselves.  Another thing you should know is it's very thick, but if you like it that way, maybe this is for you. But it was way thicker than I expected.  Otherwise very comfy robe, I have definitely grown very fond of it since the holes are fixed. XD",

I was really excited to wear it and it was somewhat soft out of the bag. I washed it before wearing fully and followed the laundering instructions to a T. I know that all super soft materials eventually lose their softness over time and after repeated washing and use. However, after zero use and a single wash, the material of this felt like literal sandpaper, not even an exaggeration. It was physically painful to even put on, hence my return. Not only that, the seams were falling apart and pilling began from a single delicates cycle. I didn’t even put in the dryer either and it still was barely hanging on. If it can’t survive that, then it clearly is not suitable to be selling for people to wear. Disappointing purchase.",
