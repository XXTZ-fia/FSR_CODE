I loved them. They are supple and fit great. I am disappointed in the new lining. The previous lining for these gloves were more like fleece or velvet feeling and the new ones have a wool blend that is slightly itchy. I still love the fit of these gloves, just not crazy about the lining anymore, plus they don't keep my hands as warm as my previous pair.",
