Margaret,Doesn't Know What It Wants To Be,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1N6GUYYLV32QT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B84D563B,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 3, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Navy,Verified Purchase,"So, this coat (?) just doesn't know what it wants to be...is it a long Blazer? A shorter coat? A heavy indoor jacket? It doesn't know. The idea of this item is great, as was the price point (got it on sale). But here's what I know:  It's pretty shapeless, a symptom of its identity crisis. This is OK if you want to layer heavily under it, but really, who would want such an elegant look loaded up with bulk underneath? It's all wrong.  Came out of the packaging missing a prominent button right at the front - which is a bad look because all the buttons are prominent. That's the point. It's such a classic look, but when one is missing it's like a smile with a front tooth knocked out.  The fabric quality isn't bad, but it's really not outerwear. Then again, I'm from Boston and looking for outerwear that's actually going to keep me warm. The buttons, on the other hand - well, the remaining ones - are super-shiny and as such, look wicked cheap.  I wanted to love this, but back it goes...",2
