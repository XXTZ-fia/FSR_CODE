Alest,Satiny scarf,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWRYXHN78HUGO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1X4QJV8,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 7, 2024",Color: Black/White,,Love the white floral patterns on a navy blue backdrop. The fabric is silky smooth satin that has six  clips to help hold it in place. It is a cute way to dress up the hair and can also double up as a neck scarf or  tied to the side of a satchel.,
Tee,Neat idea and good quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MFVCF0Y99592/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1X4QJV8,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 24, 2024",Color: Black/White,,"It took me some time to figure out how to use this. The instructions confused me, but I watched some videos from the company and got the hang of it. In case you're a bit confused about the instructions saying to pop the clips open and closed, they mean popping them between a convex shape and a concave shape. They have drawings and everything, but I swear my brain wouldn't let me understand at first.  Anyway, it's a really pretty scarf, and normally I wouldn't be able to wear one on my head without it either being too tight or slipping off, so the clips are a great addition.",2
Oregana,Silky soft and stays in place,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25C0K88GZFNS7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1X4QJV8,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 29, 2024",Color: Black/White/Gray,,"This SWAY Patented 6-Clip Non Slip Headbands is terrific!  It is silky soft and looks fabulous.  It comes in a large variety of colors and patterns.  It is ample size and styles easily in a number of different ways.  There are six little combs/clips that are sewn into the scarf.  These combs/clips are unseen and keep the scarf inn place, even in windy conditions.  LOVE this scarf/headband.",
C. Bennett,Beautiful style and nice quality,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37F2JKE6FIV1V/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1X4QJV8,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2024",Color: Turquoise/Orange/ Gold,,"This is a beautiful and versatile headscarf; I love the pattern and color. It adds such style and can dress up any outfit - much better than a basic headband or hair clip! I like that it comes with instructions as I'm not the best at figuring out how to use a headscarf. The clips definitely hold the scarf in place; what a brilliant concept to incorporate them into something that would typically just slide off your head. I do find that the cost is a bit high, even for the nice quality which is why I only gave it a 4 of 5 stars.",
Cjoy,"Hold securely, beautiful",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FRQ7X39ZMJ9A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1X4QJV8,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 23, 2024",Color: Pink,,"This scarf is beautiful. Very elegant but goes with more casual outfits too. The clips make all the difference in holding the scarf in place, but they do become a little irritating after a while and can trigger a headache for me some days. There’s a learning curve in getting the scarf to lay well. For the pictures style, it helped to twist the ends under in order to get the back folds to lay down closer to my hair.",
kibrenner,Super cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KQF512XYXH0O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1X4QJV8,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 17, 2024",Color: Navy Blue/ Champagne,,"I like this scarf and the fact that it has sewn in combs. It has always been hard for me to keep a scarf or headband on, but with the combs, I will now be able to wear them like I have always wanted to. The fabric is nice, and the print is pretty.",
carriebeary29,Didn't slip and so cute!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XPXSEC5XAJKN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1X4QJV8,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 15, 2024",Color: White/Black,,So soft and smooth! Clip stayed well. Nice and soft. Worked well with lots of outfits. Colors looked nice!,
Doghouse,Just like Picture,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RIVXR9HKOEZ7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1X4QJV8,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 15, 2024",Color: Turquoise/Orange/ Gold,,"This generously sized, pre tied scarf style head band is soft, silky, and just as described. The color and pattern are beautiful! I learned the trick of sewing wig clips onto scarves and hats many years ago to keep them securely in place, and the clips on this scarf work very well. Even with the silky material, once it’s clipped in, it isn’t going to go anywhere. I found I didn’t even have to use all of the clips to keep the headband on. Nice quality product, although the price is quite excessive.",
Chela Rocks,Clips hold the scarf on your head - no more slipping off,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R2JPZP4WWKIT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1X4QJV8,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 14, 2024",Color: Black/Cream,,"If you have ever worn a nicer scarf (not one of those cotton handkerchief kind) you will soon realize that they tend to slip off your head easily because of the silky texture.  This scarf cures that issue with some built in clips.  The scarf is a full sized square made of really nice material.  Finished well with rolled and sewn edges (no zig zagging, overlock, glued, or raw edges).  In the middle of the scarf are six clips that are the kind commonly found on the inside of wigs or hair extensions.  They are the kind that you bend one way to open and bend the other way to close and lock onto your hair.  They work well for hair pieces and it makes perfect sense that they would work on the inside of a scarf to hold it onto your hair.  The scarf comes with some instructions on the different ways to wear it.  Overall, a nice quality scarf with the little bit extra that makes it more useful.",2
Pockmarked Pariah,Stays where you put it! Color is not white...more of a light champagne,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15I0R4C9UTBRL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1X4QJV8,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 14, 2024",Color: Black/Cream,,Love satin since it doesn't create much friction on my hair and it looks great.  Wearing it is a different story as the scarfs always slide out of place.  This has solved that problem with the addition of clips running diagonally along the center.  Stays exactly where I put it and I don't have to tie it as tightly so I don't get any headaches while wearing my scarf.  Great idea and execution.,
