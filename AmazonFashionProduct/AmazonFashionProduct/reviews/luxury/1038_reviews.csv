Absolutely love that it came with battery already inside, and had a sizer tool already included this way I was able to size it to the size I desired. Haven't had any issues with clock not reading the time correctly after I adjusted it the very first time. Love the gold color which goes with any outfit. The contrast between the face of the watch, and numbers are great which ensures I am able to read the time correctly. Specially, with the fact that it has large roman numerals I haven't struggled to read the time at all.",

It's keeping good time and is just the right size to not be too tiny to read or too large to bang into things.  I've had it catch on a couple of coat sleeves due to the design, but it's not a big deal as it only happens occasionally, it depends on which coat I'm wearing as well.",

I was afraid that at such a low price point, it would look cheap, but it doesn't. It is shiny gold and dressy enough to wear with just about anything, yet it looks good with casual jeans and a T-shirt. It has a Roman Numeral dial that is easy to read. The stainless steel band is large enough to fit my larger boned wrist, and I still have enough room to make it a bracelet watch.",

My main issue is that I was trying to remove a couple of links and the process appears to be quite frustrating. I watched the instruction video and it is easy to remove but putting the pins back is very difficult. It took me almost an hour to finally put it back with multiple scratches to the watch.,

It practically screams big money, but it's got a quite reasonable price point. Despite said reasonable price, it doesn't seem to lose or gain any time over the course of weeks. The big numbers are easy to read and I personally love the Roman numerals. The dial and the band are buffed to perfection. The clasp works flawlessly and it is easily sized. When I first got this, I expected I would find multiple concerns and the occasional fall, but even after weeks, it seems as flawless as when it first arrived. If there was anything to detract from at all, the packaging wasn't exactly stunning. That said, it wasn't bad, either. ""Perfectly acceptable,"" would be the appropriate term there, I believe. So yeah, great watch at a nice price. Win-win!",
