Michael Lazenka,Totally authentic looking,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K8WXVHJ8IGTE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BF9G34QW,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 13, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"OK, there isn’t a thread of natural fiber in this shirt, but I purchased it to attend a 1970s disco themed wedding.  It was a hit. Several people came up to me and said “you understood the assignment” or “you win, best outfit here”.  It’s a one and done purchase. Even though it is surprisingly well made, I’ll never wear it again, but it served its purpose and impressed people with its authenticity.",

Comfortable and breathable. Will be great for electronic concerts. Took one star off because the sizing is a little big (order one size smaller than you normally do) and it’s obviously an issue many people have since the XL I got was repackaged and not folded or in it’s original bag. Many reviews have reiterated this.",

Whether it's clubbing, disco night, Vegas, or a party, this is the kind of shirt that will get you noticed.  I'm a bigger body frame, and the size I ordered was what I was expecting for roominess.  It is lined with a black material inside to keep the shiny material from clinging to your body, which I appreciated.  It does change color depending on the lighting which makes it a fun shirt to wear.  There's no way you won't get comments on this shirt when you wear it! ;)",3

I know it says disco era but I’m telling you when I was you in the late 80’s I had a dress that looked just like this! This is great for themed parties or New Year’s Eve or for your mama to steal and wear as a flashy open shirt over a tank top and ripped jeans to relive her youth! It’s an oversized shirt on me and is cute worn open with a knot tied in the bottom on both sides. On my sons athletic build it’s a loose shirt with a good deal of stretch. He has muscular arms and with the stretch has full range of motion in the arms. The material is soft and it’s quite comfortable. The sleeves have one button around the wrist so for me I just cuffed them. It comes with an extra button.",

It looks so cool. The fabric is soft and stretchy. The inside of the shirt is black. He usually likes his shirts a little tighter (this is a small, he’s 6’ 175-185lb). I washed it with a normal load, but pulled it out of the dryer early, just in case. It came out fine. It would look great with a pair of black pants or dark jeans.",2
