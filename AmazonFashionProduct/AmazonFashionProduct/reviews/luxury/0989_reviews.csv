I needed a flapper dress for a Gatsby themed murder mystery dinner party. This dress was perfect! I ordered the M and L just to be safe and the M ended up fitting perfectly. I would say the dress fits true to size as a M is generally what I would buy in a store or in a brand I was familiar with. I am 5’7” and about 150 pounds. I usually wear a M in tops and an 8, but occasionally a 6, in pants. 34C in the bust and you can definitely wear a regular bra with the dress. If you are bustier you might want to try the L only because this fit me perfectly, but the dress overall is not super stretchy. The lining is thick material and very comfy with some stretch, but not a ton because of the overlay and beading. The dress did not itch at all. I was shocked at how comfortable it was overall. I wore tights, but if you do not plan to wear tights please be aware that the V hemline of the dress will sneak up as you move around if you’re not careful. Overall, this dress is exceptionally well made and definitely met my expectations!",16
