Raggedy,A little disappointing,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R165WYYD2D97K4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHDD9TSH,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",Size: LargeColor: Black,,"I wanted to LOVE these since I'm all about lounge suits.  This is a pricey one...so I had high expectations.  Pros:  It's very pretty and classy.  It comes beautifully packaged and is a very gift-worthy presentation.  It's also made in Ukraine.  Cons:  The material is pretty scratchy.  Inside it has a silky feel so if you like that, it's not too bad.  But you do still touch the outside of it, which is scratchy due to the sparkly look.  The bottoms run small, in my opinion.",
Jenna Rose,Pants WAY to small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU383MYS9EMMO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHDD9TSH,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Black,,"There was absolutely no size guide listed on the product page so I made sure to go to the brands website to check the size guide on sets. I saw that my regular size medium would be perfect. It was NOT. The top fits perfectly, but the pants are child sized. I could barely get them past my bum. For $350 you would think the sizing would be impeccable. I am VERY disappointed. Also, the outside of the set is VERY scratchy. The inside is softer, thank goodness, but who wants to wear a lounge set that is scratchy? This is hard no for me.",2
