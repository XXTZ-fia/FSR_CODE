I liked this listing becasue not only did it give a size guide it also give the model's measurements and the size she was wearing. (I have fury about listings that show a model in a beautifully slouched item and when you receive it it's clear she's a size small in an item xxl.) So I felt good enough about proportions to give this a try.  And it almost ticks all the boxes. The fabric is like a knit twill, not aas soft as a sweatshirt material but the texture is attractive and the weight seems appropriate for fall. I am a 16-18 and I bought an xl based on others' reviews--and it fits both top and bottom pretty well. I bought the black with white trim so I feel like it's a bit elevated and it looks nice.  Here's the bad and it was laid out for me in the specs I just didn't catch it. The model photo shows a cropped pant length. I checked her height at 5'6"" and thought ""hey thats close enought to my height that it should actually be a cropped pant on me too!"" As a plus size, I only like a wide leg pant in a cropped length. But when I received it, rule pants were full length. Why? The S is 25 inches long. The XL is 27.25 inches long. Apparently if you are fatter you are also taller and all size small girls are petite in height! Who knew? Infuriating. And since I bought the striped-trimmed option, altering gets a step harder and more expensive.  Will I keep? Probably but not definitely. I like it but won't wear it unless I get it hemmed and not sure where my motivation is on that.",7
