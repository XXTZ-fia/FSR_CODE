They would never have stretched out enough for me to wear them. Too bad. If they were available one size larger, I would order them again.",

I bought them for someone who is rather picky. They have a motorcycle-bent to them, so come with a little flair or style, which is nice. Both versions were fairly soft inside (I ordered 2 pair). I think they need to come in XXL as well because both men I bought them for are 6'4 and thin and the XL just fit them (slightly snug). If these were thicker men I think the gloves would be too small. And I'm not sure they'd stretch too much because of the lining. But very nice overall.",

They are very stylish without being overly flashy. They have a little bit of a Darth Vader vibe with the sides of the gloves. Now the sizing is a little tricky, I normally wear a solid medium size but I decided to go with a small/medium size on their options. Just the wrist is a little tight when putting the gloves on themselves but fits perfectly after that. Now these aren’t super warm, they do have a nice fur lining inside them which makes them super soft but not thermal grade warmth. They provide a good level of skin protection, so in my opinion the provide just enough warmth.  My favorite overall thing about these gloves is the fact that these are completely touch screen coated!!! I can use every single finger, thumb, palm and knuckle to use my phone and I absolutely love it!!! Great Product!!!!",6

I would love a clip loop so I could clip them together and not lose them, but it certainly would conflict with the handsome streamlined look. I bought the ones with a soft lining inside and it is INSANELY comfortable. These look and feel like much more expensive gloves. I’m a dog walker in MN so I needed gloves that aren’t too warm (I stay warm since I’m always moving) and that are maneuverable since I have to drive, clip on leashes, deal with keys, etc. I don’t think you’ll find a better light leather winter glove for this price!

As a matter of fact,we started to having cold evenings and mornings already!! It can get brutally cold during the winter in this part of the world,which calls for a warm pair of gloves!!  Craftsmanship: --------------------- Working in a business like environment,requires a certain look,and having the right type of gloves,is a must to complete that attire! These gloves seem to work both ways! Man made soft leather,that give the true look and feel of real leather.Midnight black color,as you can see in my photos bellow,the color is really black,none of that washed out color! Sleek leather strap that closes with a snap on button. Extremely comfortable to wear,with free hand movement,no stiffness whatsoever,when the gloves are worn. On the inside,just as much attention was paid to the outside,the lining is very soft and warm at the same time! What better material to use for lining the gloves than wool and cashmere!! Both materials are high end I might add!! One other thing is worth mentioning,is the box that the gloves came in with! Elegant Gift box type packaging,makes the product ideal to give as a gift.  Final Thoughts: ---------------------- I wear 9.5 glove size,and the L/XL size fits just about right,with the exception of the fingers,as they were a bit longer than my fingers,and I have an average length fingers! I guess,they were made to accommodate people with long fingers! Other than that,I honestly love these gloves,and can't wait to start using them(not wishing for cold weather as of yet) I do recommend them,and I am sure if you read my review and get them,you'll come back and thank me for such recommendation. As for durability and long lasting,only time and use can tell! Luckily Amazon keeps the reviews forever,which gives us the opportunity to come back and report any negative or positive issues with products! Still, if you're a skeptical person and not sure whether to trust other people's reviews or not! With Amazon's 30 day return policy, you have four weeks to try it out yourself, before returning it for any reason, with no questions asked, and in most cases Amazon will pay for the return shipping, in other words, it is a win,win situation!! With that said, I hope you find my humble opinion helpful in making or breaking your buying decision.  free manufacturer's sample supplied for test/review purpose",4
