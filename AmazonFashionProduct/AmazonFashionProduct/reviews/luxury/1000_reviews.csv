Gwendolen Harrington,I love this brand!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1I3YP09MU6WX6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BN4ZRYXL,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Olive,Verified Purchase,"Mandetta is a very good brand and definitely worth the price. I first became a fan when buying a pair of ""Performance + Luxury"" style joggers that were thicker than an average jogger. I have yet to find those exact ones and this particular style is on the thin side, but the color is really pretty and extremely comfortable. They have a wide waistband that is very forgiving and would help anyone who worries about extra ""skin"" coming out over the top of their pants. I personally wear my joggers larger than I think they are supposed to be worn but that's how I am the most comfortable. With that being said, for this particular pair, I should have sized down.  For a point of reference I am 5'10 155 pounds with a waste of 30 and hips of 38 inches.",4

They are a very soft fabric and are so comfortable to wear around. The pockets are a very good size (will easily fit your phone) and the pants are true to size. I was introduced to them at a large wholesale club store, and when they stopped carrying them, I was so happy to have found them here. Multiple pairs have been ordered, so hopefully I'm set for a while. Definitely recommend.",3
