So if you are wider there, you need to go up a size. i had to go up two sizes.Then I normally do I usually wear an extra large in a dress. however, I am not very big chested, but there's plenty of room in that top if you are top endowed. it is much more beautiful on than it is. When you see it online, I have not only ordered in gold.I have also ordered in red. the quality feels very nice for the material and not cheap. it does not have stretchiness just to let you know because of the band on the top. truly recommend this beautiful dress.",

However, as was mentioned in several other reviews the zipper is awful. YOU WILL NEED HELP zipping it up/down even though you bought the appropriate size. I had a on site wedding to do (hair/makeup) and the bride was gracious enough to invite me to the festivities. I didn’t wear the dress while working for obvious reasons however after the bridal party left the suites and lined up for the wedding, I attempted to get dressed. Epic failure with the zipper. I needed help and housekeeping was taking forever to come (I waited 20 minutes for them while trying to zip it myself to no avail) to the room so I flagged down a 80 year old janitor who had arthritis 😣 I ended up wearing a shrug over the unzipped dress with my boob hanging out until the reception and someone could help zip it for me. This is a beautiful dress however if you choose to proceed forward with this purchase, take it to a seamstress so they can change the zipper. Also it’s a little on the sheer side (the dress has a built in slip but depending on how tall you are, it stops mid thigh)",9
