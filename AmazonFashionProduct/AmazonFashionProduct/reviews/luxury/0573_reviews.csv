Amazonian,Very comfy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSI6ZWYYAZ3F9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJM4VZ5N,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 28, 2025",,,"These look really nice. They are comfortable and fit well. I'm not sure how well the velvet on the outside will last, but that is true of any velvet shoe. I think they were worth the $50 they were listed for at the time I bought them.",
S. Waters,Snazzy!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RS1UQT6Z2UHDP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJM4VZ5N,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 25, 2025",,,"I ordered the Men's Penny Slip-on Loafer Diamond-Patterned Velvet Dress Shoes for some semi casual/dressy parties that lend themselves to some ""fun"" dress, theses definitely fit the bill.  The 11 was a perfect fit for me and they were not too snug. I would say that if you have wide feet they may not fit well as they do taper toward the toes. They are light, flexible and the rubber soles are comfortable.  Overall I am very please with thes shoes and would buy them again.",
Ronald Good,Only good for dressy costume,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWCDT63U5KG68/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJM4VZ5N,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",,,"These are not meant to be serious shoes.  They are adequate for around-the-house slippers, but they slip off my heel too easily.  I added insoles to make them fit better and to add comfort.  I don't like the pointy toes, so I won't be wearing them much.  One might wear these to a Renaissance Faire.",
M. Smith,Fabulous Loafers!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BKCZ3QM1Q6AJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJM4VZ5N,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Size: 12Color: Blue,,"These unique looking loafers are super stylish and comforting to the touch!
