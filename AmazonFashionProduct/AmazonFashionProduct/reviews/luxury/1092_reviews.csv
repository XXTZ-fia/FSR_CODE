The swimsuit fit really well. I love the color and pattern. The shorts are a little tight but I think going up a size would have made them too big. I only wish it had more support in the chest area. All bathing suits need to improve on this honestly. I wish all bathing suits came with bigger padding or an underwire. This swimsuit did a good job of covering the chest area overall.  I feel comfortable and it wasn’t too tight or too revealing. I also liked the length of the top. Definitely will buy from this brand again!,5
