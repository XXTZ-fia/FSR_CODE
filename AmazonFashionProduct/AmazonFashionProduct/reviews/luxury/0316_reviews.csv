They are stylish, comfortable and the sole is flexible. I walk a lot. I normally wear running shoes while walking.

Though there’s no treads on the bottom, a rubber-type coating to the heel thoughtfully keeps them from being slippy and provides traction. Very flexible, they move with your feet. The rounded toe-box doesn’t pinch and provides wiggle room. The style is super-cute and the straps are adjustable. I have them in several colors and fabrics and they are all beautiful and all soft inside. I was always obsessed with ballerinas as a kid, so these make my inner child smile! A bit pricier than some alternatives but worth it for the wearability and pretty look. True to size.",6
