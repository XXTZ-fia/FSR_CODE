Despite the fact that it's not actually linen, it is lightweight and soft, and looks like linen but without as much wrinkling. I'm tall (5' 10""-ish), so I sized up one size. It's still a little on the shorter side in both the sleeves and overall length, but I intended to roll the sleeves up and wear it open in the front over a tank top as kind of a casual ""jacket"" for an overly-cold office. For that purpose, it fits fine. It's still loose in the shoulders and bust.  My biggest complaint is the color. I was wanting a terra cotta type color, as is pictured in the item photo. It actually turned out to be a fairly vivid red with slightly orangish undertones. Since I regularly color my hair in various shades of red/plum/burgundy, the shirt color only sometimes works for me.  Still, I really like the feel of the fabric and it seems well-made, so I've come back to order it in a more neutral color. So, if the exact shade matters to you, I would avoid this item or go for a neutral color. If you're just looking for a nice summer-to-fall weight top, this is a good one.",9
