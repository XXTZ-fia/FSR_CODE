Wendy Konopka,Beautiful,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27FRHQ4CU81LQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B86WWR42,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 12, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"Purchased for a coworker as a birthday gift.  Unfortunately, she opted to refuse to accept any gifts from me.  However, this is a beautiful piece and my sister absolutely loves it so I’ll be sending it to her.  The inside is the perfect size for a ring or 2 or a tennis bracelet.  Colors are vibrant!  As you can see from the pictures I’ve submitted, the one I received has less white than pictured  here on Amazon.",2
