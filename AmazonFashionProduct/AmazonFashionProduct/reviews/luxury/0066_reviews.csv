When I got it home, I wasn't as impressed with the material it's made out of. It's a really loose weave and honestly doesn't quite look like the picture from close-up. The buttons are pearlized and actually quite large. I found the fit in the arms to be quite boxy and large, even though I have a larger bust line. I think this is a matter of taste, so, if you don't mind a large weave,  which I thought would catch on things and you might consider replacing the buttons, this might work out for you.",6

Got on sale for around $25.  I got the pink and it is true to color.  Unfortunately it is made more for petite women.  I am tall hourglass figure (5'10, Large/XL shirt and size 12 pants) and this looks short and boxy on me.  It is short and made wide.  If that makes sense.  So it is actually loose in the middle.  It's really classy, so really sucks it doesn't look nice in me. Gave it 5 stars because it is still very nice quality.  I really don't want to return it!
