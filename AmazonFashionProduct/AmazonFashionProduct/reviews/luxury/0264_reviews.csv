M. K. Norris,Extraordinary customer service,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LX09CRXYOU4E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DR36261V,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 4, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Dusty Rose,Verified Purchase,"Extraordinary customer service!! My robe was missing a belt and sending it back to Amazon seemed excessive for such a small reason. When I reached out to the company, I received an immediate response from the owner herself. She apologized and had her tailor’s make one for me and I had it within a week! It felt good to not only purchase such a luxurious product but to support a small business with such a wonderful mission. My goal is to not purchase as many low-quality items and instead splurge on true quality. In addition, we should support companies that are focused on true value and not just making a quick profit. This robe is absolutely beautiful and I still can’t believe I purchased it. I have to remind myself that I am worth it and will be using this every day for years. The rose gold robe is so pretty and unique, not the boring limited color selection you usually see. Treat yourself, you will not regret it.",

I am 5’5” and this robe fully drapes on the floor for me - it’s also *enormous* but in a luxurious wrap-up-by-the-fire kind of way. To be clear, it does not fit like the photo at all, but I’m actually really pleased about this. The silk is a lovely heavy weight and passed my thread burn test. I hope it will be offered in other colors because this is absolutely my new favorite!",

Kindle Customer,adorable and good quality but the sleeves catch on EVERYTHING,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUB0579TM78CJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DR36261V,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 10, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Deep Blue,Verified Purchase,"This is an excellent quality robe.  It is beautiful and soft, and I like it very much.  There are two downsides: (1) it has no pockets, which is inconvenient, and (2) the kimono sleeves catch on absolutely EVERYTHING.  You cannot wear this robe and walk past a doorknob or a handle or a corner table or anything without dragging your sleeve and getting snagged.  Otherwise it's a beautiful and comfortable and flattering robe, and I like it very much.  I do wish it had pockets.",

I wear a size medium, but the robe is large. It’s perfect. I’m afraid a medium would have been a little restrictive on me. The color is stunning. Mine is the dark blue. The fabric is buttery soft and has some weight to it, so it’s also cozy. I’m so glad to have received this robe. It even came with a little matching silk bag. It really is a very impressive gift. I love it!",

The blue color is really pretty and deep in person and it feels so luxurious. I love the kimono design with the large sleeves, it looks amazing! I will say that these do feel like they run large, I have the large size and while I am 7 months pregnant and normally size up to make sure things fit, this feels like it is extra large and has way too much room. But again, it is a gorgeous piece and I love the message that they are spreading. They even included a thank you note which I also thought was a nice touch.",3

It’s super comfy to wear and feels amazing against my skin, the color is also incredibly gorgeous in person. I included a picture of the bag because it she’s the brighter blue in the inside of the piece and the outside is darker. The robe comes folded nicely in a bag that would be incredibly giftable, with tags on the bag explaining how to care for the robe when cleaning it as well as one that’s written by one of the women who makes these. All seams are incredibly clean and I haven’t seen any issues.  Is it expensive? Yes, but the quality and material makes it completely worth it in my opinion. I’m very much “if the product is worth it, then the price is fine” and I feel this robe lives up to that. If you have the money and want a gorgeous piece, definitely check this out!",3
Fastfoodyogi,When in doubt size up,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K9BT3DGTVNUZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DR36261V,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 3, 2023",,,"I needed a new bathrobe to replace my tattered, worn out terry-cloth robe. I have young kids so bathrobes are both a necessity and a hazard. My 2 year old tends to yank open the robe at the top or the whole robe just flaps open or unties and any hopes for modesty go out the window.  This kimono style robe solves that issue with two ties - one on the inside and the other on the external side. It also has two belt loops that are pretty low for my short waisted self, but work fine with the included belt. The second belt loop on the right is immediately beside the external tie strap so it’s to miss.  The material feels AMAZING and though it feels cold when I first put it on, it matches my body temperature and I feel comfortable in it even in the cold winter mornings (in my temperature controlled home).  I wasn’t sure which size to order. For reference, my measurements are 36-28-36, so I am on the large side of medium or the small side of large according to their size chart. I went ahead and ordered the large and I’m glad I did. Once I tie all the straps and the belt, it’s not quite snug around my body, but if it was any tighter I would probably pull out seams and the fabric every time I sat down.  I’ve owned multiple robes over the years include kimono and yukata style robes and I think this may be my new favorite. The color, the feel, the construction, and the practicality are all on point.  I do have one point of feedback that is not star-losing-worthy but a mild irritation. There are no pockets. It will probably keep the robe nicer over the years as a result, but the added function would be a nice convenience.  All in all, highly recommend.",14
