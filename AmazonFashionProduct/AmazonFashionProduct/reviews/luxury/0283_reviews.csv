Low and behold when I tried to pull off the pill *yes I know you can shave them*, it began pulling out the LINING of the jacket and didn't stop. (This is a quilted jacket where they've used a thin layer of quilting but no lining between the quilting and the outer layer). I don't know if anyone else experienced this ??? but I'm soo bummed because I love everything else about the jacket!!!

I’ve been trying to buy natural fibers for many reasons. I’ve grown to hate polyester having kids clothes that need to be washed often and the feel of over washed polyester, collecting lint, piling, it infuriates me. This coat was made with cotton and polyester. The stuffing possibly was polyester. Anyways—the jacket was wrinkly as all heck, loose green strings just detached in an unreasonably significant amount. I took it off and I was covered in the strings. The stitching is wonky, it would need to be completely wrinkle free to see if it actually fits vs curled and riding up the entire bottom of the coat. I’m disappointed this jacket is as expensive as it is, and the quality is so poor. I’m starting to not trust foreign made items. The description is almost always deceptive, the item falls apart after a few wears. One wash and it’s never the same. Don’t buy this jacket and probably anything the company makes.
