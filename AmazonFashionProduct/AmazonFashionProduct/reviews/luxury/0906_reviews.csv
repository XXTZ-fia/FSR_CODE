THAT SAID: It's incredibly sturdy feeling, and the quality seems fantastic. I've already gotten several compliments on the bag. It's classy looking. I like that there's a R or L option for where to put your pew pew, and the zipper lock is AWESOME. I'm someone that usually carries a Coach bag, and I find this quality comparable for a fraction of the price. I definitely recommend this bag.",8

It looks like a designer bag. I got the Stone color and it is an incredibly versatile shade. I ended up not using the wallet because it was a little small for what I normally carry and just a little stiff.  The only tiny drawback I can find with it is that it is heavy before you put anything in it. It is extremely heavy with my phone, makeup, a couple of lipsticks, keys wallet and my A5 planner, which is a must. Then, I had to add the Ruger LCP2 and extra magazine. Thank goodness it's small and light.  I do really appreciate the ability to lock the zippers, as I have a grandson and am often around other children.  I thought about returning it, but it is too gorgeous, and I think even if it doesn't end up being an everyday carry bag (I really prefer to carry on my body), this purse would be perfect for an occasion where you don't want to flip your dress over your head to get to your gun. I'll probably eventually buy it in black.",9
