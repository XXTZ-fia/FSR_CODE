Since I saw no other pictures with this exact set, I took and chance and ordered it anyway.  Here to say it's sadly NOT the color I was expecting - it's a much more rose-y, pinky brown, and much lighter than was is pictured.

I have that menopausal spare tire around my tummy. I found that even the Apricot color was perfectly concealed. But if you are any heavier, this isn't the outfit for you.  It is a surprisingly good quality for the price. The material is soft, warm, and suitable for fall. I won't buy polyester/rayon clothing as I can't stand how it feels on my body. But if it's blended with pure cotton, Viscose, Tencel, or Modal, then it's a game changer. Of course, I'd prefer not to have a blend at all, but I'd also prefer a reality TV star's bank account.  One downside is the lack of pockets due to the lower price, but overall, I find the outfit lovely. I have not yet worn or washed them, I plan to update this review once I do.  While I prefer to support my country's manufacturing, I support free trade! If purchasing a better product for a lower price is made elsewhere that fits within my budget, I am happy and grateful for the ability to buy it.",4
