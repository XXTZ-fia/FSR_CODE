This robe is amazing.  Soft and plush.  It is great for after shower and just lounging.  I love the mid calf length and you don’t get too hot if you are getting ready while wearing it but it’s cozy enough to stay wrapped in it after a bath and watch tv as well.  Also nice right after a shower as it doesn’t make you feel like it’s keeping moisture on your skin or sticky. It continues to dry your skin without being scratchy or feeling like the robe has become soaked.,3
