My only small sticking point is that the fabric gapes a little between buttons, especially during wear even though it fits me a little on the large size. I think it's because the fabric is so stretchy and forgiving, which is great everywhere else in the sweater but it feels like there should be something a tad sturdier behind the buttons. I may try to add some sturdy fabric strip on the button side to see if that helps, but overall it's adorable and worth the money!",3

It is so cozy and such a great fit, at least prior to washing. I just think the way it’s marketed gives a false impression if you are looking for more of a true, stiffer tweed and the structure of a jacket. Purchased in the light blue color and can see myself stretching this to be a truly 4-season option that works across several different settings and occasions.
