The top edge of the boot leg had no stitching or seem and so the edge was not firm, clean cut or uniform all the way around the edge. The legs were like a floppy, formless, handbag. I was pretty surprised. The boot legs are not stiff at all and are baggy.  I am athletic, but have average calves. The legs were way too loose, compared to the pictures. The foot bed was very hard with basically no padding. There’s no way I could handle walking back and forth down an office hallway all day, walking a block down the street, shopping, or doing anything all day in these.
