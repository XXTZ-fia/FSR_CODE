Kasmo 🍪,Fun Shirt 🌟,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R72H5394D707U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJ7DDN6J,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 27, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Multicolored129,,"This is a unique shirt. It has a fun vibe with the gold paisley design, and even though it looks somewhat lustrous from afar, it’s actually more subdued in person, which I like. It has a snappy appearance, stylish and even refined in a way, but at the same time, it looks a little less than professional. The fit is good, true to size, and overall, I like it. The collar and cuffs are especially nice, and the material has a versatile feel and washes well. A bit pricey.",

Somehow I received a much larger size than ordered and needed, but it worked out for the project. The shirt has the brand on the back, and it obviously is “inspired” by a brand that I love and buy often - Versace. I am so surprised that this would be placed across the back, but it worked well for a comedy costume.  I am sure the other shirts from this brand look fashionable, and they do have a nice variety to choose from!",

I probably would have been more impressed with a solid color shirt as opposed to the poorly printed one that i have. You can look at the shirt and see the separation in the print which really makes the shirt look cheap. This will probably become an item that I just use in my photography studio because i can always make it look better with photoshop.,

The interior of the shirt is a blank whitish/gray color so if you roll up the sleeves, that horrible color contrasts with the bright colors of the shirt, and it looks bad.  Still, this shirt will get the attention of the ladies and the jealousy of the men who are not bold enough to wear it.",

I don’t really know (or care much) for all of the exclusive luxury brands, but was able to find the inspiration for this. While I doubt anyone who knows their shirts is going to mistake this for that, it does have a passing resemblance to what I’ve been able to find. Definitely wouldn’t mistake this material for 100% silk, but it also was reasonable to the touch and comfortable wearing, at least over a t-shirt and I would normally wear with any button down long sleeved shirt. The shirt was actually a bit heavier than I imagined it would be. Not uncomfortably heavy to wear, it just felt a bit more substantial than I was expecting. I believe with reasonable care I’ll get enough use out of it.  With most manufactures, I would wear a size XL, tall if available. The body fit as I expected/hoped it would, although the sleeves are a bit short for me. With my arms at my sides it almost looks long enough, although if I were to move around much, the sleeves do look too short. Pretty much how many of my long sleeved shirts fit as I can’t always find shirts in tall sizes. I just roll up the sleeves a bit as if I’m really going to get to work. Still, I believe the sizing is accurate.  Perhaps my memory is a bit hazy with age, but this sort of reminds me of the shirts I wore in high school in the late 1970s. Wild colored and patterned, 100% polyester things. I got this mainly for the 70’s nights on cruise ships. I’m not going all out like some do, but I can bring along a shirt like this.  I can recommend this shirt. It’s a fine party shirt or for going to a club. Material feels nice, a bit heavier weight than expected and the artwork is crisp with vibrant colors.",

Absolutely stunning . Most people are familiar with this kind of print and it can look really cheap it the print is not good . Not with this one . The fabric is so nice , almost like silk , but in my opinion even better , because it is slightly thicker than silk and it has a weight to it . That makes it lay better on me . I tried the silk one , which I can not afford , this one I honestly prefer . The craftsmanship is top notch . My mom is a tailor and i know what to look at . It’s made impeccably . I can go on and on because I love this shirt . It came vacuum packaged to my surprise and was very wrinkly . I was a bit worried . But the material is so good , It didn't take much effort to iron it . You can see it in the pics . I didnt wash it yet , so I cant tell if it will hold up or not . It is such a statement piece , more to go out , party kinda shirt . I didn't have a chance to do that yet . But I know I will enjoy a lot when I can wear it . My partner was very jealous when he saw the shirt . Thank God we are not the same size , lol . For the size , I am 5.10’ 265 large overall with a belly . I thought I should go with larger size so I ordered 4XL . Just in case . But 3XL would have been a better choice . 2 XL would also work but will be a bit snuggly maybe , I prefer my shirts a bit flowy , if that makes sense . I will buy it over and over . It worth all the money they are asking for .",
