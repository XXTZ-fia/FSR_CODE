It may look OK at night where you can't see the quality quite as well, but it's also not as soft and plush as real velvet.  It's decently made. The stitching is OK. The buttons are a cheap plastic, almost costume feeling. Again, if you wear it at night, it may not be a big deal. The fit is pretty good.

This included incorporating a heavy fusion of smoking jacket/tuxedo jacket/regular business casual jacket. I absolutely love the concept of having a velvet dominant coat, with lapels present or not included. I will do a lapel aby day, but will also enjoy a coat that blends the main color in relation to that region of the garment. The Coofandy brand has never let me down and became my go to brand for affordable blazers. I want not aware they were into the velvet blazer. To clarify i have one other one that uses velvet though i did not think to look into other variations of that idea. I usually gravitate towards a well known name brand for velvet blazers until now. The Coofandy brand has designed a velvet- lapeled blazer that used a beautiful lighter blue that reminds me of clear ocean water. I chose the medium size and it fits like a gem. It is slim fitting and has raised cuffs so my watch can be seen. I like the upper front pocket which is wide, and will likewise accept my thicker style pocket squares that i enjoy using. The shoulder room is perfect, with it looking flush up there and no looseness that overbulks the shoulders unnecessarily. This is a five star blazer as far as i am concerned. I do wish they would not send this packaged in a zip up bag. I know all brands seem to be doing this but why? It is so easy to damage a blazer with it folded like, that rather that arriving on a hanger in a wide box, where it may be half way faded but not multi folded like this one was. Also, is you have a velvet type of material it can crimp, then leave a white mark where the discrepancy it. I am lucky that did not happen but still the packaging is to unprotected. I for sure recommend this and am super happy i own another affordable classic from he Coofandy brand.",2

I usually wear a small in this brand so I decided to take the risk by ordering a small jacket even tho I was afraid it might be a bit too tight. It was the perfect fit! I can button it without having to hold my breath, I can move my shoulders and my arms without it pulling to tight on the seams and restricting my movements. This jacket is perfect and I really want a few more in other colors now! I recommend giving this brand a try! Everything I have purchased from them has been spot on!",

I started the returns process within an hour of receipt but despite system promises of an emailed returns document/Label within 2 hours of my request, nothing arrives by email and the returns time is fast running out. I’ve tried the returns process every few days but nothing works which is the first time I’ve had an issue like this with Amazon.",
