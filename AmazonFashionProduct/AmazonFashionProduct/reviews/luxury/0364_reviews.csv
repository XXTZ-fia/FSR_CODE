I am loving wearing them. Have basically worn them every day. I found them to be true to size. The top seems really over sized, which I think is the style. If you have larger upper arms, you will really like this set. I don't have large upper arms, so they are a bit loosie-goosie, but I can fix that easily on my sewing machine if it bothers me. So far I have just worn them for 5 days in a row and I get tons of compliments. My favorite part is the waist band. It's thick and substantial. None of me is rolling up and over the top of this waist band like I do with many other sets. I will buy this set in a few colors.",5

It's certainly not the most attractive outfit out there or anything, but it's perfect for ""just lounging around the house"" sort of days -- a step above PJs, but just barely, and they still let you enjoy that pajamas kind of comfort.  So far they hold up well in the wash too, even when they accidentally got thrown in with my bedding and went through on a hot cycle. The cut of the sleeves is a little odd, I think I'd prefer regular t-shirt style sleeves than these that are more like halfway between tshirt and sleeveless, but they're still perfectly fine the way they are. The fabric is a bit on the thicker and heavier side, which is perfect for colder days, but it's still loose enough and breathable enough to handle somewhat warmer temperatures as well.

I think they are so cute and so comfortable. I did end up sizing up to a large when I am normally a medium and it was perfect. For reference, I am 5’8 and sometimes the pants are too short in sets. I actually think it is really flattering set with a bit of a baggy feel. I love the color, it is just as advertised. I would definitely recommend.",

That being said, the knit is not like a sweater knit, nor like a Ponte or sweatshirt style knit fabric. Instead, it is more akin to a thin t-shirt material that's a bit clingy. Runs small and shrank a bit when laundered, so consider ordering up.",

I just love everything about it. It’s comfy wear but still nice enough that you look like you tried to put yourself together like you put some thought into it. It has a little bit of weight to it, but not too much that it’s going to make you uncomfortably hot. The fabric is butter soft. I am obsessed with the color. This is going to be my new favorite Friday casual wear outfit. True to size 170lbs large 5‘6“.",5

I don't find the material to be breathable.  It is most definitely ribbed material.  One thing I do appreciate is the opening at the sleeves is not overly large, it is just the right size with the finished opening.  The drawstring waist is good for adjusting to just the right tightness.  I just wish this was more breathable and lightweight to wear this summer but will be wearing it in the fall with cooler temperatures.",

I really like the style but the fabric is very heavy!  I weighed this outfit and it weighs over 2 lbs!  That being said the fabric is very nice and soft.  This outfit washes well with no wrinkles and I even dried it in the dryer and it did not shrink.  I will wear this around the house and see if it works like a weighted vest!  The outfit is cute, durable and washes well. It has an average price tag for clothing of this quality.  I would recommend this outfit but be aware of the weight.",4

I would typically order a medium but since this is lounge like, I ordered a large.  The material is heavy but not thick.  It holds shape nicely. It doesn’t stretch out and look sloppy as you wear it. The shirt is good length, and fits well.  The pants have a thick elastic band that stays put. (It is tighter than I expected but not uncomfortable.) The drawstrings really work if needed. I love the look and feel. I think the quality and value align.",3

I really am happy I ordered this jogger set. It’s well made and is different from many of the ones I’ve seen this fashion season. I love the slight ribbing that adds dimension and structure in the pants and ends  with a cuffed leg. The pants also have a thick and heavy corded drawstring that looks veřy stylish. The shirt has the same ribbing that helps elongate my figure and has cute short sleeves that adds a sporty vibe to the track suit. Right now it’s chilly in my part of the country so I added a brown crop style jacket /hoodie and i got so many compliments on my outfit! Besides looking like a fashionista the jogger set is very Cozy and comfy… One of my favorite outfits of this season for style AND comfort!,

I wear it exactly as advertised with the shirt loosely tucked in at the front and it's SO COMFORTABLE! It's meant to have a baggier/oversized feel for ultimate lounging.  I love that about it.  The pants are super cute and I love the drop shoulder on the shirt.  Overall I think this is an excellent value for the price.  It's one of those sets that you can wear around the house or slip on some cute runners or sandals to run some errands.  Loving the versatility and the comfort.,

HAS POCKETS!!! I repeat, HAS POCKETS!! Waist band is comfortable with drawstrings and cute little metal pieces on the end just to add a little flare. These are perfect for comfort travel, lounging, or just an every day outfit!",
Angry Customer,Comfortable and Stylish Women's Two Piece Tracksuit - Perfect for Daily Wear and Workouts!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRI0AG9HJRETS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYLXPVXH,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 2, 2024",Size: SmallColor: Solid Dark Khaki,,"I recently purchased the BTFBM Women's Two Piece Tracksuit Short Sleeve Tops Long Pants with Drawstring Outfits Jogger Sets for my wife, and I must say, we were both extremely impressed with the quality and fit of this product!  The tracksuit is made of a soft and breathable fabric that is perfect for both daily wear and workout sessions.  The short sleeve top and long pants provided enough flexibility, and the drawstring feature in the pants ensured a secure and adjustable fit. My wife also loved the trendy design and look of the tracksuit, making her feel both cozy and stylish at the same time.  Not only was the fit true to size, but the range of colors available allowed me to pick the perfect shade of brown for my wife, which she absolutely adored. Since receiving the tracksuit, she has used it frequently for her daily walks and gym sessions, and she has mentioned that it provides her adequate support and freedom of movement during her workouts.  The quality of stitching and finishing was top-notch, and the tracksuit has maintained its shape and color even after multiple washes. It is definitely a durable addition to her wardrobe that can be mixed and matched with other pieces as well.  I highly recommend the BTFBM Women's Two Piece Tracksuit for anyone looking for a comfortable, stylish, and durable outfit perfect for daily wear or work out sessions. The price is reasonable, and the quality is exceptional. It would also make a fantastic gift for a friend or loved one!",2

Anytime you order these sets it's hard to get the size right, unless you can order a medium pants and small top, which would have been ideal. Either way these pants are super soft, well made and hit just at the ankle. I did think they'd be too long so was pleasantly surprised when I saw they were not, as I'm 5'2"".  The top was way too big so I'll wear the pants alone and maybe the top as a layering option.",7
