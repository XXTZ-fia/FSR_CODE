I actually just accidentally dropped a seasoned, oily piece of food on them and tried to clean them-they’re ruined. The area just spread throughout the whole shoe when I got them wet.

I spot cleaned the white only, careful not to touch the black. Everything seemed great. As they fully dried overnight, everything black bled onto the white and now the shoes are not wearable (if you care what they look like)… here’s the kicker that makes me the most frustrated. I reached out to Sam Edelman support because that’s what Amazon makes you do, and they refuse to stand behind their product or order any support for issues related to this. They made the shoe. They knew it would do this, and yet, this practically brand new shoe that I spend $70 is down the drain and they’re just hoping I’ll buy another pair.

I left them to dry flat but the color bled upwards. Of course now it’s a year later and not able to return. Sam eldelman isn’t seeking to be too helpful either.  My opinion is - if you’re gonna make an expensive shoe with suede, you need to make sure that the suede has been washed enough and so the bleeding wouldn’t occur if they got wet.
