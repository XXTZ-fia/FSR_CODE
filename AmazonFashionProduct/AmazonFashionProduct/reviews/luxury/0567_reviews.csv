jillyb,Beautiful!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I0PCT4GW9LJX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQT3KF3Z,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 23, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"This is a very elegant pants set with dupatta. I ordered the deep royal purple color, it is beautiful and very rich looking. The legs have a band on the bottom and the top decoration is a combination of embroidery and sewn-on trim. It's a very good price for the quality. Where I live these outfits are very expensive and sold only in boutiques. And not in as many sizes as here.  So here's the kicker- I am a large American 6' pear-shaped woman, not at all the body type contemplated by anyone creating this outfit. I am a US size 16W or 18. When my Indian friends took my measurements to Mumbai for some wedding wear, they didn't believe there was a person my size!! The 4X size is perfect, it has an Indian size 48 on the tag. Yes, I am four times the woman anticipated to wear this, but it is a beautiful fit and looks perfect on me. I may order the dark green or another color too.  And the vendor was kind enough to include a gift of some matching jewelry, earrings and a necklace, so my outfit is complete! It is difficult to find American jewelry which looks correct with these outfits, so the extra gift is appreciated. I will be back!",

My husband loved it as well and sent photos to his friends. I ordered it at the last minute and the package came just in time! The seller included a beautiful necklace, earrings to match it, and another pair of green earrings to match the green dress along with a wonderful handwritten message. Everything fit perfectly, I suggest you order according to the size chart instead of your normal size. I’m between a L-XL but like to wear XL because I like loose fitting clothes. I ordered a XXL and it was flattering. If it were any smaller it wouldn’t have fit. So I would say order 2 sizes up if you want a more form fitting feel or 3 sizes up for a bit more breathing room",
