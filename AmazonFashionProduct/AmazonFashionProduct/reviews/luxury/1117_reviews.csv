Print is loud and fun, but the colors are subdued enough to not be too crazy for regular wear.  The zipper, stitching and elastic cuffs/bands all look good quality.

AmyFranklySpeaking,It's Polyester and HOT to wear,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2USNE7R0GOK12/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07S64CPNR,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 18, 2024",Size: LargeColor: G Track Royal Blue,Verified Purchase,"Purchased this to wear to a 70's party.  The STYLE worked for the 70's look and feel I was looking for, including the fact that it's polyester, which I did not want but tried anyway.  Luckily I only had to wear it for a few hours because the MATERIAL felt SO HOT and I was indoors in air conditioning. It's not a warm cozy feeling, but instead a SUFFOCATING feeling.  Some reviewers mentioned the yellow coloring of the white stripes on the pants. Yes, that is true, some parts of the white are WHITE and other parts of the white are actually a YELLOW color. I didn't mind since I was only wearing once for a party, but if this bothers you for the look, then I would pass on this one.  I generally WEAR a size MEDIUM and some reviews said to go larger, so I GOT a LARGE and it was ROOMY but NOT TOO BIG. Good thing I did size up since it was already so hot to wear.  The PRICE is GOOD if you get good use out of it, or even if just for one time.  Overall IT WORKED for the event, but I WON'T WEAR AGAIN. Will donate it.  PROS: Nice bright color - vintage looking style Zipper works well (only worn one time though) The price is right!  CONS: This is polyester material - doesn't breathe at all - so HOT to wear The white parts of the suit are yellow in some areas. The sizing is slim and may take purchasing two sizes to see which works best.",3

So I decide to get one for myself! I wore it on Halloween with some bling and love the pattern. I wear it all the time! I am 5’9” and 170lbs. I typically wear a 10-12 (M-L) pant size depending on brand and an 8-10 (M-L) up top. I ordered the XL and loved the fit, but wish the sleeves were a tad longer and that the fabric had a little more give at my calves. Depending on how I’m sitting, I can see the stitching pulling. I do have calves that are a little larger 16-16.5” circumference. So if you are smaller it won’t be an issue. My sister loved my suit so much she ordered the green in an XXL (We wore them to Thanksgiving dinner). I plan to order the navy in the larger size as I tried her’s and it was a comfortable fit on my calves and the jacket was longer. I’m looking more for comfort than sex appeal. I don’t know how the manufacturer can say the 2XL is a size 15? There must be a lot of inconsistency with sizing. For that reason I will only order the ones with Prime that can be exchanged easily.",46

My weight is 139 pounds and I am 5 feet: 4 inches tall. I usually wear an large or ex-large in a blouse. From my past purchases the notes said I should consider an extra large. I took a chance and went the vendor measurement chart and selected a medium. The front when zipped is a little baggy which is needed to hide the tummy area. The bottoms hits right at the ankle which is perfect for me. The arms hit right at my wrist. The medium works perfect for me. I purchased a second one and waiting for one to come back in stock.,5

It feels like real ass sports tracksuit material. If you have big calves/ankles, def size up. I assumed this would be stretchy as hell and lower quality. I ordered a small so it would be more form fitting. It IS form fitting, but a *little* tighter than I would like. Order your real size, and order up a bit if you want a slouchier fit.  I have both the dk green tiger print and the leop ard print. I am a little larger in the calf/ankle area and I would have definitely ordered up if I knew how tight these are in the lower leg area. Please please order up if you have big calves.  Otherwise I LOVE THIS TRACKSUIT! The material is high quality, the zipper looks durable (which is hard to find in any modern garment), the dark green tiger and toucan print is beautiful, and the metallic gold accents are even nicer in person than photographed. IT HAS POCKETS! the jacket has 2 and the pants have one back pocket, and 2 hip pockets.  My only complaint in the quality of construction is the jacket pockets are securely fixed in, but the body of the pocket kind of flaps around a bit and effects the way the jacket hangs when it's unzipped. I'm going to add a few stitches to affix them to the jacket properly. Otherwise, I honestly expect this set to last forever.",19
