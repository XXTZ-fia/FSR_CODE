Just order it and you won’t regret it!!After reading several reviews, I came to the conclusion that a Medium would fit me best.  Amazon suggested a Large for me but several people who are my height and weight all claimed that a Medium fit perfectly and was loose but not too oversized.  The outfit runs Large so if you prefer a more form fitting size, I recommend going down a size and you will still feel comfortable.  This outfit is not only stretchy but it’s also made for comfort so it’s not going to be tight.I am 5’ 6” tall and I weigh 145 pounds so I ordered a Medium and it’s very cozy and not too big but loose enough.  I could easily order a Small and still have plenty of room without it being snug.  I like my clothes to fit loosely and look comfortable so I’m keeping the Medium and I will order a Small next time.Several people claimed the fabric shrinks after washing and putting it in the dryer so I will definitely be washing mine in cold water and laying flat to dry.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this set.  I will say it is pricey but the quality is definitely worth the price.  I will be watching for it to go on sale for the holidays and I will definitely order more in other colors.I hope this review helps those of you who are on the fence about whether or not to order this set.  I find a good review should include your weight, height and what size fit you best.  The more information you give helps narrow down the perfect size for others before they place their order.  The size charts aren’t always accurate and shopping online is difficult.The color is Beautiful and looks exactly like the picture.  The fabric and detail is very high quality.  I would consider this outfit lightweight as far as how it feels on my body but you could easily get away with being very comfortable on a chilly Fall day or night without a jacket or coat if you’re like me and get too warm in long sleeves.  The fabric is very soft and just the perfect weight to be considered Loungewear and not heavy like a sweatshirt and sweatpants.  You could wear a Cardigan over it if it’s really chilly without overlayering.",15
