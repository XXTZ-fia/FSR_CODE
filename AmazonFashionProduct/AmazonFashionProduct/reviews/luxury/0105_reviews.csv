Philip,Beautiful Pearl,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3C5U920CGYG4Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHQMBWYW,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 17, 2024",Size: 12-12.9mmColor: 4 Leaf,,"This necklace features a genuine, high-quality pearl with a stunning golden champagne hue. The chain is made of sterling silver and elegantly gold-plated, adding to its luxurious appeal.  Among the many pearl necklaces I’ve reviewed on Amazon Vine, this one stands out as one of the finest. For pearl enthusiasts, it's a must-have addition to any collection. I’m thrilled with both the necklace’s beauty and its excellent value for money.  Overall, I highly recommend adding this exquisite piece to your jewelry collection.",
Robert,Very nice.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2A11Q1AR7OA6G/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHQMBWYW,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 29, 2024",Size: 12-12.9mmColor: Three CZ,,"So the necklace seems to be made pretty well. I didn't see any glue seeping out of the pearl and pendant joint and everything has a nice polished finish. The pearl itself is not perfect like cheap plastic pearls, so it gives me confidence that this is real, even if it is a cultured saltwater pearl. It's beautiful and my wife likes it, so I would recommend it.",

Perlas,This 12mm genuine golden pearl is blinding! 🤩,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32A63I1L3ZE7U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHQMBWYW,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 3, 2024",Size: 12-12.9mmColor: 4 Leaf,,"So I have purchased one of the lower end quality pearl earrings from YAMI a while back, and I wasn’t too impressed with both the packaging and the overall quality of the black pearl earrings. And for that reason, I haven’t purchased anything else from them since then — until — this “Pearl Necklace for Women, Golden Pearl 12-12.9MM Round, 925 Sterling Silver Necklace, Saltwater Cultured Pearl Jewelry,” which is one of their high end, fine jewelry pieces, as the shiny and big golden pearl on this necklace is totally blinding to me! 🤩  While this is the very first golden pearl I’ve ever owned, but I’ve come across them in my past shopping experience for pearls, but sadly, their asking price from my go-to pearl brand, weren’t something I could afford as these saltwater golden pearls can easily go for several hundred dollars from bigger name brands/stores if they’re South Sea Golden Pearl however, which are the only gold pearls that comes in natural gold. Other golden saltwater pearl are dyed in gold, which is I think this golden pearl is from YAMI is, as the listing at time of my purchase, didn’t mention anything about it being a South Sea Gold Pearl, but just “Saltwater Cultured Pearl.” Nevertheless, the golden pearl on this pendant looks perfect, and for the price, I cannot complain. This pearl pendant necklace looks like it should have costs way more than its current asking price as it is perfect in every way and/or loupe-clean. It’s also a big genuine golden pearl, with high luster, thick nacre, shiny, and very smooth to the touch. It is well-attached to the pendant, with no visible glue anywhere, unlike other comparable pearl pendants I’ve looked at. The addition of Cubic Zirconia or crystals (unsure, cause there was no mention about the gemstones used on this pendant at time of my purchase) adds a nice touch to the pendant. As for the chain, it is solid, just the perfect length, and it’s beautifully plated with yellow gold, which should keep its shine and luster for a long time, with proper care.  That said, I absolutely recommend this golden pearl pendant necklace to others as this isn’t only a bargain for the price, but this will also make for such an amazing addition to your jewelry collection as well as make for a lovely gift. Thank you! 💝",3
Bronto154,Good looking pendant,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21YQSV3NFBWC5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHQMBWYW,"5.0 "," the United States "," March 25, 2024",Size: 11-12mmColor: 4 Leaf,,The necklace is simple yet attractive. The pendant is unmarked and unblemished. It is a nice reasonable size and securely attached to the moderately gauged but sturdy chain. The clasp operates easily. Overall this is a nice necklace that you can wear anywhere.,
Nimue,Gorgeous Pendant; Incomplete Description & No Documentation,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17X4YBV7FDDUT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DHQMBWYW,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 9, 2024",Size: 12-12.9mmColor: 4 Leaf,,"There is a lot to like about this pendant: the pearl is large, with nice lustre and a beautiful colour.  It is close to being perfectly round.  The setting is lovely, even though I am fond of neither vermeil nor cubic zirconia, and the box chain is a good size and solid.The seller's description is very careful to avoid calling this a South Sea Pearl and does not mention origin--odd, as if this is, indeed, a saltwater pearl as stated, the size alone would mean it is almost certainly of South Sea origin.  The colour is a medium gold and does have the satiny shimmer one expects from a genuine Golden South Sea pearl.  I photographed it next to an 18k gold medal and 19.2k gold crucifix to better get a sense of the gold tone.  Has it been dyed or heat-treated?  The description does not say.  If dyed, I will admit it's been done well: no evidence of dye pooling in the pits or around the top, and it is more true gold than the usual bright yellow of dyed pearls.  That said, I am nowhere near expert enough to say definitively if this has or has not been in some way enhanced.They are also careful to avoid grading these pearls--fair, as there is currently no official standard in this regard.  The one I received has visible flaws throughout (though mostly on the back), but they do not detract terribly from its beauty and reflect the price paid.  Obviously, you are not going to get a gem-grade South Sea pearl pendant for around $80!It comes down to this, I guess: if you like the look, don't mind the lack of documentation, and are okay not knowing the details of origin and possible treatment?  This is an excellent price for a lovely pendant.  If not, there are plenty of vendors offering certified South Sea pearl jewellery--just expect to pay accordingly.",
