When I went to take some links out, using the tool and instructions provided, the instructions given were for a different type of watch and the tool just bent as soon as used. Also, the pins were rusty which meant it was extremely difficult to take even one pin out let alone the amount needed to adjust the watch. The watch isn’t adjustable because of this, and also the battery wasn’t working. Even when I replaced the battery, the watch didn’t work. This may have been one bad case, but unfortunely now I have a really pretty but unusable and useless watch",

It has nice tiny little links so you can size it in small increments to fit just right!! I was nervous about sizing and adjusting it myself after reading the reviews, but my 10-year-old son helped me and between the two of us we were able to hold things and tap the pins out and back in place fairly easily.
