Corey,AWESOME GLOVES!!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCE9145VHR9FY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09NVXP8N6,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2021",,Verified Purchase,"Was pretty excited to get these gloves for my honeymoon! They are very stylish without being overly flashy. They have a little bit of a Darth Vader vibe with the sides of the gloves. Now the sizing is a little tricky, I normally wear a solid medium size but I decided to go with a small/medium size on their options. Just the wrist is a little tight when putting the gloves on themselves but fits perfectly after that. Now these aren’t super warm, they do have a nice fur lining inside them which makes them super soft but not thermal grade warmth. They provide a good level of skin protection, so in my opinion the provide just enough warmth.  My favorite overall thing about these gloves is the fact that these are completely touch screen coated!!! I can use every single finger, thumb, palm and knuckle to use my phone and I absolutely love it!!! Great Product!!!!",6

Accurate glove sizing. Easy to put on. Bought for my father and he said he could feel the heat building immediately after putting them on. Only out 4/5 because the buckle kind of has zero purpose. Will update after winter on full review of durability.,

They ARE NOT LEATHER! They are a foam plastic material from China that smells horrible. Then upon returning these toxic ""gloves"" I was given a gift card for my money...  Summary of dislikes, and reason's for return:  Ordered black. Recieved gray. Plastic NOT leather. Horrendous odor.  Positives:  Cool box.  I would absolutely not recommend these to anyone, for anything...",

Not only is it high quality, they’re also incredibly comfortable and look awesome. I would love a clip loop so I could clip them together and not lose them, but it certainly would conflict with the handsome streamlined look. I bought the ones with a soft lining inside and it is INSANELY comfortable. These look and feel like much more expensive gloves. I’m a dog walker in MN so I needed gloves that aren’t too warm (I stay warm since I’m always moving) and that are maneuverable since I have to drive, clip on leashes, deal with keys, etc. I don’t think you’ll find a better light leather winter glove for this price! And it works with the touch screen on my phone so well! Great buy, go git it breh.",

They didn't have a size chart, so I ordered the XL. The largest size available. My hand measures 9.5 inches. I could get them on, but they were uncomfortably tight. They would never have stretched out enough for me to wear them. Too bad. If they were available one size larger, I would order them again.",
