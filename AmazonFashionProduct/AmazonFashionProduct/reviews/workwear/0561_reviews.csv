I had to look at the tag to make sure it was not a unisex scrub. I had to keep tugging it down to make it sit where it should. This top is also very stiff and doesn't breathe well. I hoped that after a couple of washes that it would get better but it still is the same. It was past the return window and decided to use the top as a house cleaning shirt since it is too uncomfortable to wear for work.

They have just enough stretch without becoming overly baggy. They last many years with being washed regularly.  Stains come out with no effort. I've even gotten a little hole in my pants scrub and it never developed into a large hole or run after another 2 years of washing and wearing them.  The only reason I've had to retire a pair of my scrubs is that the thighs wore  thin from my thighs rubbing.  That was after 6 years of wearing the same scrubs. The price for a full set is very affordable.,
