"I am truly impressed with the Yasumako Japanese Reishi Mushroom supplement. As someone who studies oriental herbology, I am well aware of the incredible properties of medicinal mushrooms, and reishi in particular is revered for its health benefits. This product has exceeded my expectations in every way.  Since incorporating it into my daily routine, I’ve experienced a noticeable boost in my energy levels. I feel more awake and vibrant throughout the day, without the energy dips that sometimes occur. Additionally, it has greatly supported my parents’ immune health, which has brought me much peace of mind. They seem stronger and more resilient, experiencing fewer colds and health issues overall.  Given my background in oriental herbology, I can confidently say that this reishi mushroom supplement is of exceptional quality. Medicinal mushrooms have extraordinary properties, and reishi stands out as one of the best. This product is pure, potent, and you can truly feel the difference it makes. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality supplement to boost energy and support immune health. It’s definitely a worthwhile investment in well-being",Big pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1M8LECUR3SN72/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DTPZ4YS5,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 13, 2024",Color: 1 KhakiSize: 44,Verified Purchase,The best quality .

Comfortable: I wore them right out of the packaging and there was no breaking-in or itchy sizing chemicals. Still To Learn: Have no idea how durable these cargo pants will be. They are not heavy-duty, that is clear, but I did not buy them for camping or anything particularly rough, mainly for a casual style option other than jeans, for which they are perfect. Fact I Forgot To Mention: Despite have an elastic waist, there are also belt loopholes.",3

These lightweight pants fit the bill. I do like the elastic waist, which is comfortable and holds the pants up but also has belt loops should you want to wear a belt too.  The XL size fit me perfectly, and my waist size is 32 inches. I'm 6 ft tall, and the length was just about right, but I'm glad it wasn't any shorter. Haven't washed them yet so don't know if they will shrink at all. Also, looks like they will be easy enough to iron. One thing I was a little disappointed about was the color. I was expecting an army green color but these were more a grey-green.  But overall a decent pair of pants if you are looking for something to wear in warmer weather. They are a bit too thin to wear outside in the winter time in the northern US.",4
