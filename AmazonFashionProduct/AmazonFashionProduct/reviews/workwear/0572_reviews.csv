Even the Size Large, fit more like a medium. Normally, I usually order a Size Small OR Medium, depending on the style.  But, in the case of this shirt (White) I ordered a Large. As I said, I'm REALLY glad I did.  I ordered it today, about 1600 (4PM) and I just received it, two & a half hours later. It has a really nice, almost silky feel to it. Also, it is ""Fitted"", which I don't remember reading that. But it is.  I do NOT like ANY of my clothes to fit snugly on me, which is why I usually order things in size Medium, but I am REALLY glad I ordered this in Large. So, I would order up a size or two, if you have a large chest. Or if you do not like snug-fitting shirts. It is REALLY VERY nice & I just ordered it again, in Large & in Blue. It REALLY is that nice & VERY reasonable.  THANKS, AMAZON !!",6

I was a bit hesitant on figuring out the correct size for myself. I always wear an extra small but the measurements suggested a size small. I went with the extra small and it fits perfectly! The material is thick enough to not be see-through yet light enough to wear running around work in the middle of summer in South Florida. The shirt wash as well and is surprisingly pretty wrinkle free every time I take it out of the dryer which is a major plus! I am very happy with my purchase and plan to buy a few more shirts from this company. Amazon and this company packaged my shirt well and I had a quick delivery. Thank you so much highly recommend !!,21
