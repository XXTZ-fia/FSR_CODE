I normally wear XL so I bought XL. Everything fits great EXCEPT the length. This pullover is about 2 inches too long. It looks silly. I haven't decided if I'm going to wear this tucked in or what. Normally I'd return it because I know it'll bother me, but I already washed it. I should also mention that it's not ""mid weight"". It's the weight of a typical heavyweight t-shirt. Collar is good, quality zipper, sleeves are of good length. It's just way too long in the torso :/",

The material is super thin, and almost rough/scratchy. Also the sizing runs huge! I ordered the size small for my husband and it is insanely long. I tried shrinking it in the wash and had no luck. Usually carhartt has better quality pieces but they just completely missed the mark with this one. If you are going to go through with purchasing consider that it runs large and it may not fit as desired.",
