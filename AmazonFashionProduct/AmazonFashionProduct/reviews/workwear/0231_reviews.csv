They run alot bigger and baggy all around.  I will NOW pay more attention when ordering this brand of tee shirt or any kind of shirt in this brand.  Lesson Learned.

I could immediately tell the fabric was not the same as the previous K-87 shirts I’ve bought over the years… the fabric is not as thick and robust as it used to be for sure, in my opinion.  Two months later it was extremely obvious comparing these new shirts to older shirts of mine…(I probably have 15 or so) these newer shirts just simply aren’t the same high quality they used to be. BOTH new shirts were “pilling” very badly, and when holding it up to light you could see through it much easier compared to many years old shirts.  Giving credit where it’s due, I called Carhartt and they stood behind their product… sorta. They paid for me to send them the shirts back, and sent me two replacement shirts… those shirts however seem to be made from the same cheaper fabric and are pilling as well.  I recently ordered more shirts and pants from the trading company in Mt. Horeb and the their Longtail T-shirts are still (for the time being anyways) the same comparable quality as the old Carhartt K-87 Tall. My dollars have now switched to the trading company in Mt. Horeb… and the workwear company named after the horse.",

The heavyweight fabric is extremely durable, and you can feel the quality right away—this shirt can handle tough tasks without showing wear and tear.  The loose fit is perfect for moving around comfortably, whether I’m working outside or just relaxing. It’s not too baggy but gives me plenty of room to breathe. The pocket is a nice added touch and comes in handy for small tools or a pen. The color is unique and adds a little something different compared to the typical work shirt colors, which I really like.  This shirt also holds up great in the wash, with no shrinkage or loss of color. I’ve already bought a few more in different colors because they’re so dependable. If you need a tough, comfortable t-shirt that’ll last, this is it!",
