Jeff L,I ordered 32W x 32L - I received 38W x 30L. How does that happen?,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R52RB8AUI5AO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09R13HXNF,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 2, 2024",Size: 32Color: Gray/Black,Verified Purchase,"These pants appear to be very well made, and very feature rich. I was looking forward to no longer needing a tool belt, I couldn't wear them because the size differed so much from what I ordered. I've returned them and ordered a 30W x 30L (Amazon recommended 32W x 32L). I'm hoping to receive the size I actually ordered. Edit: 7/6/24 I actually received a 30W x 30L pair within two days. Now that I own a pair that I can actually wear, I have to say that these are an excellent pair of work pants. I only wear a leather tool belt now when I need something to clip an impact driver to. Amazon recommended 32W x 32L, but the 30W x 30L fits me perfectly. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the first shipment being so far off, and because of Amazon's return process. It was recommended that I take the package to return to a ""UPS Store"" with only a QR Code, and that it would be free. The first ""UPS Store"" I took it to told me they didn't process QR Codes at all, and the second one wanted to charge me $5 to scan a QR code and print the label. It is misleading for Amazon to recommend the QR Code return method as ""free""!",

The zipper pocket on the left needs to be an inch taller to fit a traditional tall billfold or I suppose a digital device.  There should be Cordura at the top of the nail pockets, so you can clip a knife or ruler without eventually tearing the fabric.

The painter pants held up extremely well over 9 months and I absolutely loved the built in knee pad pocket. Its been a game changer not having to constantly remember to grab knee pads or a kneeling pad from my truck. If you're doing a floor installation get your kneepads. They're not great all day long, but here and there the little cushion on the knees saves me.  Now I just bought the x1600s and I think they're great, maybe not worth TWICE as much as the painters pants, but they're still really good.  The main reason I bought these was for working in finished homes around clients furniture. If you're working in a finished house and want to have more hand tools on your person, or need 2/3 pockets with different size screws, then these pants are where it's at! You don't have to worry about scraping cabinets with your bulky tool bag. Obviously you can't carry everything from your tool bag but the extra pockets and pouches can really make your day go smoother.  One thing to consider is they're hot! Extremely comfortable in Colorado winters, but I wouldn't recommend them for summer work.",2

I'm not sure which buckle these are designed for but I guess I'll be shopping for one after writing this.They're probably a bit too heavy to wear if you're working in 90+ degrees, they are by no means the worst but if you're working outside in extreme heat, these aren't it for that.  I work in and around a theater building mostly on HVAC - while it does get warm in those spaces it's not the same as construction work outside, I'm mostly stationary and these can be mildly uncomfortable for non-AC areas.",

BUT! they are not sold in the states.  New job has a ""uniform requirement"" that includes black pants. So, as much as I want to I can't use those overalls, but I found these black pants.  NOTE the cut is not a ""Relaxed fit cut"" like most US jeans so buy larger and use a belt if you need too.  These do allow you pretty much a always attached tool belt, so if your like me and never set tools down (when ya do you lose them) these are great.  Main negative is that if you have big thighs like me, the side pockets are attached completely and I blew it out by having my large wallet in the pocket when I crouched down to lift a toilet. But even minus the one pocket there are still more then on any other work pants I've had.  The material is thick and durable and the seams strong. insertable knee pads are great and I hate when I wear pants that don't have the pockets for the kneepads. They are sold separately and you can get any brand of the insertable knee pads not just blaklader's ones. Moral of the story, if your in the US and looking for a great pair of work pants that include a tool belt I can't recommend a better product. If your in europe?

Absolutely worth spending the extra money for these over any other work pants.  Ive never been more happy with any purchase.  I work, a lot, and my work gear gets some serious wear and tear. These pants hold up to everything I could put them through, and they're extremely comfortable.  They fit exactly right, to the point that I don't even need to wear a belt, which makes wearing my tool belt with these pants even more comfortable.  Usually I'm not a fan of built in tool pouches because I rarely use them, but the design of these built in pouches is beyond perfect. If you don't want to use the pouches, they tuck inside of the pants and actually provide additional cushioning on my hip bones, exactly where my hips usually get sore from the weight of my huge tool belt all day long. On most other work pants with built in pouches, I just cut them off as I never use them over my tool belt. With these pants, I love that they're there, tucked into the pants and adding extra cushioning. Whoever designed these pants really thought of everything.  So many zippered pockets, loops, and pouches, I easily and safely carry my phone, vape, painkillers, putty knife, and utility blade.  I love the zippered pockets for my phone and vape especially. I used to leave them in my vehicle as they would always get covered in sawdust, dirt, and other debris. Vaping sawdust sucks. But with the huge zippered pockets, my vape easily fits inside and never gets any sawdust or debris in it.  These pants just FEEL serious. The material is incredibly resilient and sturdy. Whenever I put these on I feel like I'm putting on a suit of armor. My boss and anyone else I work with have been real impressed with all the features, and at least two of my coworkers are ordering a pair of these after seeing me wear mine.  They also look awesome. They form to my body perfectly, never feel like they get in the way. Some work pants just feel too baggy, reducing my mobility. Not these. They are heavy duty pants but I feel agile and mobile whenever I wear them.  The kneepad pocket design is different than what I'm used to. Usually you insert kneepad from the top, and then velcro the pocket shut. With these pants, the Blacklader Kneepads (which are not included, and are much larger than most traditional kneepad inserts. Highly recommend those as well) fit VERY snuggly inside the kneepad pockets, but are inserted from the bottom. Then there is a small lip inside the pocket that the bottom of the kneepad sits on top of. No velcro, buttons, or zippers, and it's a TIGHT fit. Took me fifteen minutes to actually get the Kneepads to fit in properly, but once they are in, they don't move or slide around like most other kneepad inserts I've used. And they are big. Longer than traditional Kneepads, they protect most of my shin and my knees. They were difficult enough to get in that I don't even bother removing them, I just wash the pants with the Kneepads in the pockets. It's tricky to get them in, but completely worth it once you've got it.  I can't recommend these pants enough. If you've ever been on the fence about spending a bit more for Blacklader pants, all I can say is, you should buy these. You will not regret it.  Ill be ordering another pair soon, eventually I'd like all of my work pants to be Blacklader.",13
