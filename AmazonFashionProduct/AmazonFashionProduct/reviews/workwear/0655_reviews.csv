Yani,Size up,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CQ5RCBWNI126/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CJ3DD1HN,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 5, 2024",Size: XX-SmallColor: Caribbean Blue,Verified Purchase,I usually buy an xs in everything because I'm 110 & 5'1.  All my scrubs I have to buy xxs or xs. but I definitely could have gotten a small or maybe even medium. I learned I like a looser fit with scrub jackets & this one fits very slim to my body. I look silly when I wear my company crewneck sweatshirt under it like I like to when it's cold . Also the seams are not flat anywhere they are rippled no matter how many times i use my steamer to lay them down.,
