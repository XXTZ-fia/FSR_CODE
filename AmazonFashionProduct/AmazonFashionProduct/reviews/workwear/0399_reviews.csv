He loved these pants except that the waist was so high that they ride up in the back. We returned them and are getting a larger waist size to see if wearing them lower, with a belt, will help.",

"I got cut by it in the hip and got ring worm and staph, fits odd in the cup too",they run very small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OQS0K53L4PA4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQ9Q8XXL,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 14, 2024",Size: 31W x 30LColor: Black,Verified Purchase,buy 2 sizes up,
Kevin Choi,EXACT same fit as the Dickies 874s,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T96BUZ2TGX99/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQ9Q8XXL,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2024",Size: 32W x 32LColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I bought these hoping that they'd fit a bit looser than the 874s, but they actually fit exactly the same. The only difference with these Skateboarding versions is that they have thinner and larger belt loops, and a button fly closure.  The material is the same 65% Polyester 35% Cotton blend as the 874s. I have three pairs of 874s and they all fit exactly the same as these when laid on top of these. From the leg opening, to the knee, the thigh, the hips, and the waist, they're identical pants.  I'm giving these 4 stars because they didn't technically mislead with the description of these pants, I just had the expectation that they'd fit a little bit looser or at least a bit differently from 874s, which you can buy for half the price. If you're on the fence about these and own a pair of 874s already, just buy the 874s, unless you REALLY need the larger belt loops or button fly closure.  I ordered a 32x32, just like all of my other 874s. I'm a 6'0"" male weighing around 160 lbs. I'd say you should size up one or two inches in the waist than your typical jeans, but I think people freak out about the waist sizing on these pants because they want to wear their pants around their hips, like 3-4 inches below their belly button. But Dickies pants typically have a pretty high rise, around 11-12 inches, so you should be wearing these at your true waist, which is at or one inch below your belly button. If you aren't used to wearing your pants that high and never worn Dickies 874s before, I'd say measure your true waist around your belly button before ordering. My true waist measures in around 30-31 inches, and the 32 inch waist I buy for Dickies typically gives me about a half an inch to an inch of wiggle room. When I lay them flat they measure perfectly at 32 inches at the waist. I think people are just used to the vanity sizing from most brands like Levi's that make you feel like you're a smaller waist than you really are.",5
#davekane,LOVE THESE!! Run small though!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TXAEWAYUMPA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQ9Q8XXL,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 12, 2024",Size: 32W x 30LColor: Dessert Sand,Verified Purchase,"Waist runs pretty small (as I find all Dickies do). I definitely recommend ordering at least one size up. I ordered these for work as a tour guide on a boat in Newport because our “uniform” has to be khaki pants or shorts. However, I am now considering getting them in every color because they’re so comfortable and the cut is “old school”. By that I mean it’s not tapered but a straight open leg and cuff. I’ve found them versatile in the fact that I can wear them as the full pants they are, or on warmer days/nights I can roll them up and still look and feel stylish. They’re well made, seem very durable, and I may even wear them in the off season… which for me is unheard of! Haha. I say “Order em now”!",4
William Gary Brownlee,Not true to size.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Z1ZXGOE9JTUL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQ9Q8XXL,"1.0 "," the United States "," July 17, 2024",Size: 32W x 32LColor: Black,Verified Purchase,These pants are way too tight in the waist. I know that dickies tend to be snug in the waist but this is beyond that. Especially for a pair of pants that is made for skateboarding.,
Barteck Manen,Better Than Denim,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU8Y45O71CM0M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQ9Q8XXL,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 25, 2024",,,"I've wore denim more than any other material when it comes to pants most of the time. Been a fan of Dickies just for work related activities until now. I thought I would switch up and start using Dickies regularly as far as pants goes. I've skated in my younger days but no longer. I bought these not for that purpose, but for comfort. I initially bought 34s at the waist matching my jeans size but it ended up being too small. I then went with 36 and it was a better fit but on the tighter side. I allowed time to break them in and it ultimately became the perfect fit. I purchased 2 in different colors. They will initially feel stiff, but trust me that will change after regular use. If you really want them loose this ain't it. My typical preference are slightly baggy, but learned to love these. These replaced denim for my daily wear.",

The fabric is awesome and in my opinion, the color is darker in person. I love the color still, however. The fit is smaller for me as a female bc I have hips. I was hoping they would not come up so high on the waist. The 874 in the same size feels roomier. Great pants, however.",3

I’m 5’9’’ and 185. I always fit well and loose with a belt in a size 36 x 30, which is what I ordered. These came entirely too tight for a 36. Would recommend upsizing whatever your size. Only other size available for me was a 38 x 32 so I returned the pair I ordered. Otherwise I would have been happy with these",
