Love the cargo style.  I'm more into relax / loose fit.  I'm not trying to wear my wife's narrow leg, tight ass jeans when I leave the house?  I do have a couple of criticisms, however.  1). The zipper is hard to work.  Seems cheap compared to the quality of the pants.  2). The main button above the zipper suffers from the same problem.  Seems cheap as well compared to the pants.  Also the hole the button is supposed to slip through is pretty small, so it was a challenge at 1st to button them.  They're still tough to button/unbutton, but they seems to be getting a little easier over time.  Overall, I love the style, but I fear that I'll have to get the button and zipper replaced at some point.",5
