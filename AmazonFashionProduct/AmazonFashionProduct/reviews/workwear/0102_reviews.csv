Fit is true to size and while i wish there was a touch more stretch just for comfort, but that's my only real 'complaint'. I can wear this tucked or untucked and it's nice for work either way. For a more casual look, i can wear it open with one of my band tees underneath. It also looks great with blazers, cardigans or hoodies. All of the stitching is nice an it's got a really subtle feminine silhouette. Wash on delicate and dry on low and all will be fine... the fabric really doesn't like to wrinkle TOO much",
