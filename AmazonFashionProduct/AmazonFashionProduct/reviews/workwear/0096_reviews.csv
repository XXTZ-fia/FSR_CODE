If you have something like for instance a phone, in the pockets on the side when you kneel they bind. These might be useful for painting at best. Just spend the money and buy the blakladder.",2

These are the only work pants he will wear. They hold many tools, and do not get burn holes from the welder. The knee pad inserts we bought separately provide a nice cushion. He has never torn them or split the inseam and gets them very dirty while he's working. They hold up very nicely when washed in warm water and are hung to dry. After they're dry, they're put in a low heat dryer with a dryer sheet for softness and to avoid wrinkles. They keep their durability wash after wash. They are affordable, less expensive than some others and have more work wear features than most. He has worn many other brands over the years and these are definitely his favorite work wear pants. The shipping is fast and customer service is available to assist with any questions.",

First, the pockets on the side of the legs are worthless, those are for looks in casual pants, not work pants. Have you ever put anything in them and tried to walk or bend down? You'll quickly find they are a joke. Velcro has no place on work pants. It takes too much effort to get a pocket open. Flaps for that matter are worthless. You need pockets you can get into easily, no flaps, snaps for velcro. If you feel you need a secure pocket in work pants, which I'm against, then a large easy to open zipper is the way to go.It The open pockets and front bags are fantastic, you're on the right track there. The knees and hems are also genius, they'll wear well and not ravel out. Overall the pants are really good, just mind the small details that can annoy the heck out of you when working.",

The knee area has a piece of extra fabric as reinforcement and I noticed that you can actually insert a piece of foam or maybe they even make a knee pad insert. I add a square piece of high-density foam when I need to be on my knees. There are these hook and loop areas around the belt area that I am still trying to figure out what they are for but I am sure there is a reason for them. I am very happy with them and the company too. I contacted them with a concern and everything was handled extremely fast. Good job!!  Thank you.",

The manufacturer clearly uses a single pant pattern for ALL SIZES and just makes the waist smaller so you end up with what looks like MC Hammer would have worn to the jobsite! The phone pocket ends up so low down it is behind the knee which stops you from being able to bend your right leg! I ordered a size up as instructed and the button barely buttons up! If I wore one more size up it would look like I am wearing the bottom half of a burka for siamese twins!,8

Definitely run tight in the waist, so order up on size. They were also clearly designed first for durability and function, so you should know that they aren’t going to be made of cuddly soft fabric. The pockets and holders are also well designed, and so numerous that you’re pretty unlikely to use them all. If anything, there are so many pockets that you run some risk of forgetting where you put stuff. The front flap pockets in front can be easily and comfortably tucked into the traditional front hip pockets when not in use.  As an added bonus, while fashion was definitely not the point of this purchase, my wife even says they’re good looking.",2

They are quite possibly the worst pair of work pants I’ve ever bought. The stitching on the utility pockets began to come apart after two days on one pocket and after a week on the other. The knee pad on the left leg is twisted towards the inside of my leg which is incredibly annoying when walking and when I kneel down I have to adjust it every time. And to top it all off a hole has started on the right knee and I’ve only had for just over a month. I’ve bought better pants for less at Walmart. I’ve worn this type of work pants for years and this is by far the worst. Do yourself a favor and don’t cheap out, buy Blakladder or Carhartt.",3

In checking the leg length it appears these were actually mislabeled. The legs are definitely 36"" and the waist is more of a 30/32.  Over the past few years I've noticed men's pants can vary greatly in waist size.
