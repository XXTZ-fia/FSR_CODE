These have a fit that are way tighter, feel significantly thinner, and even if they do stretch, it seems like they need to be worn down a catwalk, not to a worksite. I’m using them for city clothes now, but they aren’t serving their purpose as work pants this go round, which is unfortunate because the price is steep.

That being said I finally found a pair of work pants I love! They’re durable, well made, pockets are the perfect size and amount and they fit nicely. I’m between a size 2 and 4 and got a size 4. They get softer after each wash and after reading other reviews I haven’t been putting them in the dryer to keep them from shrinking. I fully expected this to be another pair of work pants that I tried on and returned because it was either cutesy and not functional or functional but looked absolutely ridiculous but instead I ended up ordering a second pair.",

The stretch helps and they are super cute. Glad they're not too baggy. I'm expecting to lose a little weight, so I guess alls well that ends well. Very glad I got the longer length too. Was afraid I might get a pair I'd trip over. Very satisfied and expect they will get more comfy as they are worn and washed a few times. I don't think they'll shrink to become unwearable. Love all the pockets. Durable bottom hem. Update: got the green ripstop. Love. Ordered size up. What came was a 14/34. See added photos) Comfy fit. Flattering and functional. Love the style.

I usually get home and can't wait to take off my pants as they are stiff and heavy. These have been on all day and into dinner. My only complaint is that I'd like to see the back of the pant come up a little higher so that when I squat, I don't have plumbers crack. These are a mid-rise pant which I love, but the back could be higher.  The fabric is super flexible and didn't seem to stretch out from morning to night. Most stretch pants do end up stretching out. Time will tell with how these will hold up on the stretch.  Tons of pockets. So many that I misplace my items. I like a side utility pocket, as that's where I put my phone. This side utility pocket is located to the back of the seam which puts my phone under my leg when I sit. I'm not too happy about that but it is comfortable when standing and I would like that pocket to be a little longer.

Look at my photos to see the sizing difference in the waist when laid end to end. The 8x30 was about an inch larger in the waist than the 10x28, and 2 inches larger than the 10x30.

There is little to no give especially when you get sweaty so moving around and bending and squatting is nearly impossible. Florida heat is no joke. The rise is high so you get all sweaty by your stomach too and canvas makes you chafed. I will definitely be buying a belt and not ever wearing them on a roof inspection. I definitely thought these would have more give so I could move around comfortably. I’ll stick to wearing these on indoor inspections and plumbing losses.,

Jennifer Hidalgo,Awesome utility pant!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Z8A71P3QR58U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B4KH4VR4,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 19, 2021",Size: 6 LongColor: Grey Canvas,Verified Purchase,I love these pants for work! Finally a utility pant that fit my body! Carharts are great but don’t fit my body. I love these. The overall are my absolute favorite. If you don’t have the tiny waste to big booty ratio these are better than carharts,2
Chris J.,Plus up your size if you need extra movement.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PO7B0D1L3AML/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B4KH4VR4,"3.0 "," the United States "," February 8, 2021",Size: 10 LongColor: Grey Canvas,,"Bought these for my girlfriend that works on WWII airplanes.  Ordered an 8x30 according to her measurements.  They fit well if they were intended to be regular pants, but were too tight and not as long as she likes for all of the squatting and crawling in tight spaces involved in her job.  This is where the whole process got really painful!  I returned those and ordered a size 10x32.  I was sent a 12x28! Those were then returned and I received a 10x34! So frustrated.  Who's packing these things?!?Needless to say she kept this size because she was afraid of what we'd get next.  She just gives the cuffs a couple rolls.  Otherwise she's excited about these pants and I hope that for all the trouble they were that they work out well.",
BBrown,Heavy Duty but runs small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Z9T3PLQJ2145/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B4KH4VR4,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 5, 2021",Size: 10 LongColor: Grey Canvas,Verified Purchase,"Very heavy duty denim and feels like it would wear well over time.  I work outside with wildlife and need rugged pants that can stand some abuse.  These do run small.  I'm 5'6"" and 145lbs and normally wear a size 6 to an 8 in pants. I sized up one size to a 10 based on the reviews and I'm glad I did as these run small in the waist and don't have a ton of give.  These are also made to be worn at your natural waist which I like because it guarantees no plumbers crack when I'm bending over. Overall I like them - they're not fashion jeans and won't fit like fashion jeans.  As work pants they will do very well!",

They are a bit snug around the waist and a little higher than some of my other pants. I do think they look good and feel fairly comfortable, so I'm happy. I normally wear a size 6 and bought a 6. I think the 8 would've been too big. I'm about 5'4"" ish and around 130lbs.",2

Layla Wood,"No stretch, low rise, loose waist but tight in thighs",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ENCOY7CL12V6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B4KH4VR4,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 19, 2021",Size: 10 Extra LongColor: Grey Canvas,Verified Purchase,"Not good for small waist/large thighs or butt. Little to no stretch through thighs, which was strange because I have the black dovetail overalls and they’re super comfy and stretchy. This canvas material is super uncomfortable (in my opinion). Waist band too large, pants were slipping down.  If you’re built taller and leaner maybe they’d work, and if you don’t mind zero stretch.",
