Different sort of thermal pattern to this shirt, I like it.  For $18 or so it's worth the price.  Fits good even after wash and sleeves aren't too slim. Large 185 lbs 5'10.5""",

The material is kind of thick. Overall, this is a very handsome shirt.  You can wear this shirt to casual situations. It is a bit too casual for church or office environments. It’s more for office luncheons, hanging out with friends, or maybe going out to the movies.  You can wear this top with jeans and a pair of sneakers.  This top is machine wash.  I would recommend this top.",
Chris W.,Nice shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LOILBPI3F41Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3JFJJZR,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 14, 2023",Size: 3X-LargeColor: Duck Brown,,"This is an amazing shirt and the quality is perfect for anyone looking for a sturdy work shirt. This is a great shirt for those looking for a flexible work shirt that’s very easy to move in and provides a sturdy feel.

This is a great shirt and love how it feels, if you’re looking for a higher quality shirt that’ll last you a long time, this is a great option.",

Monnie Ryan,"Fits Well, Looks Great",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3J75BO910CJBC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3JFJJZR,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 6, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Olive Green,,"My sweet hubby practically lives in henley-style knit shirts from early fall to late spring - either on their own or under something else like a flannel shirt. And when he's ""done"" with one - assuming it's still got some semblance of shape and original color - I usually snag it for wearing on my morning walks to get in another year or so (at least) of wear. This one fits perfectly in that rotation, although from the looks of it, it may be a while before I get my hands on it because he's more than satisfied. It fits him perfectly, so it's true to size, and the olive green is a color he doesn't already have. Of course, it's machine washable - plus soft and comfy and not too heavy to fit under a shirt or jacket. Good buy!",
Powder Creek,"Warm, soft and comfortable, fits just right",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23AGK8LMXK5N8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3JFJJZR,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 4, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Duck Brown,,"This shirt is perfect for autumn weather. It's warm and soft with a pleasant texture. It fits just right, not loose and not skin tight. Most Henley type shirts don't have a pocket. This one does, so that's a handy feature. The material is 60/40 cotton/polyester, which should wick nicely but still have a good feel. Made in El Salvador.",
RenaissanceDad,"Nice thick material, a little bit oversized...nice fall/winter shirt",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJOBE466IO6U6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3JFJJZR,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 2, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Olive Green,,"I like the quality of the material and construction.  It feels like it will be durable.It provides good breathability and warmth during the colder months.  This can be used as a layer as well.I'm fit, so this fits loosely around the waist for me.  It's also a bit loose everywhere else.  It's fine for what it is, I would still suggest ordering the size you normally are since the shoulder width is near perfect for me.  It's not advertised as a slim fit, so no stars off for that.",
PicassoPC,"Comfy, color is spot on and fits really well",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R169Q87WX6EFA1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3JFJJZR,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 29, 2023",Size: XX-LargeColor: Duck Brown,,"I really like this long sleeve shirt.

Summer,Perfect middle weight Henley. I like the sleeve.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4KWURSYSF454/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3JFJJZR,"5.0 "," the United States "," October 21, 2023",Size: X-LargeColor: Black,,"This long sleeve Henley style shirt from Wrangler is a 60% cotton and 40% polyester blend, making it a medium weight shirt that feels quality while being breathable and durable. The front pocket has extra stitching and a pen holder for on-the-job site work. Black is not too dark or light.  (My photo does not do a good job showing the correct color.)  It can be worn out casually while still retaining classic workwear look and feel. Perfect for a base layer in fall or winter.  I am an XL and it fits correctly.  Sizing runs true to size.  It will not shrink since it is a poly/cotton blend.  I really like the sleeves and cuffs.  Very comfortable to wear and looks good.",
