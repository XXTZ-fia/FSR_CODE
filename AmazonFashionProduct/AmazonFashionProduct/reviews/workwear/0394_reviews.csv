I usually wear a large but I ordered a medium based off reviews and size chart. It’s a tiny bit snug around my breasts if I button it, which I don’t plan on doing, but it fits perfect everywhere else. Good length in the sleeves and body. It hangs below the waste so it’s not box shaped or unflattering. It’s stretchy a bit so it doesn’t feel tight when you move your arms around. It’s thin but not cheap thin. It’s breathable and comfortable. I ordered it in the color navy, and though it doesn’t match 100% to my navy med couture or mandala scrubs, it’s close enough that I’m fine with it. I also have a pair of Cherokee iflex scrubs in navy, and this jacket is a dead ringer in color, mostly likely because it too is Cherokee iflex brand. I also had the Cherokee iflex zipper scrub jacket while I was in nursing school and it worked beautifully, still going strong. Cherokee makes great products and I will likely order another one of these to have as a backup.",5
