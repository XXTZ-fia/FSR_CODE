Ray,Sleeves only have one button but otherwise not bad,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R392SHLEE3581C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDY9YQD6,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 4, 2024",,Verified Purchase,The sleeves only have one button each unlike the typical two button style.

Kenny H,"Yes, there is good men’s fashion on Amazon.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Y8G6R75NT1KY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDY9YQD6,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 9, 2024",,Verified Purchase,"I bought one of these, hesitatingly. The pictures make it look rather cheesy, but with Amazon Prime, a guy can toss the dice, return it if it bites. This defo does not bite. I bought another color, in fact.  It looks more spendy than it is, rather like Madewell, the fit is true to size and roomy, the fabric is a good-looking lighter weight, comfortable and incredibly verstaile in a wardrobe. It’s one of my favorite additions this spring.  Never heard of this brand, like so many on Amazon in clothing, but I am very happy with my jackets. So one knows, they run longer than a trucker jacket, which I liked.  Handsome jackets about which I’ve been asked many times.",

It is definitely more jacket than shirt because of the thickness of the canvas material.  This will absolutely protect you from the elements.

Fbx_Steve,Runs small; sleeves tight; bizarre care instructions,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2URVCC3H1Y3JT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DDY9YQD6,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 16, 2022",,,"This shirt runs a full size small, as with most clothing made in China. I ordered a full size up and got a good fit.I got the shirt for working outside and in the garage during cool weather, wearing just a t-shirt underneath.  It fits well in this scenario.  I found the sleeves a bit tighter than expected. Not uncomfortably so, but not as loose as the rest of the shirt. The shirt is a nice, heavy cotton that seems very substantial.Finally, the care instructions can best be described as ""bizarre.""  You are supposed to handwash it and dry it flat--no dryer.  OK, that's fine for woman's delicate nightgown.  But a work shirt??? Seriously???  I washed it in the delicate cycle on cool and dried it on low.  It came out fine, though a bit wrinkled (which is to be expected of this kind of cotton).  I've only worn and washed it once, so we'll see how it hold up over the long run, but I refuse to hadwash and dry a work shirt flat!",2

Basic boxy styling, no muscle shirt this.Says to handwash and dry flat.  For cotton?  Really?  It’s not a Merino wool sweater for goodness sake, so  I’m not gonna do that.  My concession to careful washing will be cool gentle cycle.  We’ll see how that works over time.  I like it so recommended.",
