I got a 34 originally but they were just too tight, sized up to a 36x30 and they are pretty good!  Main issues with the pants are the QC. I got 3 pairs and they are all slightly different from each other. Nothing massive, mostly just different leg lengths. One pair has the fly flip a bit too far off center, but a belt seems to keep the fly from coming apart.",

Waist fit perfect like my old pants, BUT now thighs are super baggy, and length seems a bit long!!!! Not sure if it’s a dickies thing, or an online ordering thing. I still fit great in 34” waist in other brands. Love online convenience, but may have to buy these from Sam Walton now.

These pants were huge in the waist and they were not a 28 in length at all!! They were more like a 34 in the waist and a 32 in length! The whole reason I ordered these were because they offered a length of 28 which is hard to find. I purchased 2 pair in 32x28 and  both pair are huge way too long, so it's not like just 1 pair was missized. I can't believe how huge these pants were. I don't recommend buying from this seller and I won't order again.",

They’re comfortable with a relaxed fit, providing enough room to move without feeling baggy. The sturdy construction ensures they won’t rip or tear easily, which is essential for long days on the job.  I love the classic style—these pants are professional enough for a work setting but also casual enough for everyday use. The wrinkle-resistant material is another bonus, meaning I don’t have to spend extra time ironing. They fit true to size and have a slightly tapered leg for a more modern look.  If you’re looking for high-quality, long-lasting work pants that can handle anything your day throws at you, these are a great choice. Highly recommend them for anyone who needs tough, comfortable pants for work or casual wear!",

Checking the Dickies page on Walmart, I found a warning to consider sizing up. They even have a tool where you enter the size you wear in other brands, and it suggests the equivalent Dickies size. For me, it recommended 35x32 based on my Dockers. Unfortunately, Dickies doesn't seem to make a 35-inch waist, and 36 seems way too big.  So, I returned to Amazon and ordered a 34x32. This time, before removing any tags, I'll compare them to a pair of my well-fitting Dockers to make sure the size is right.",
