The product is not damaged or soiled and is in its original packaging. The only reason for the one star rating is because the ""Overall Rating"" field is required for this submission. There is nothing wrong with the item that I received; It seems like a good set of scrubs. It just does not fit. I should have tried on the product before today but I did not. I recognize this is my fault but ask to be allowed to return the item for a refund. Thank you for your consideration.",7
