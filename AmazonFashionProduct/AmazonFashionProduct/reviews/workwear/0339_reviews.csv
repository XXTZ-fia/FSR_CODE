Marcy B,Thin!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VC79AFYRINE5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMN1N5DM,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Color: Dark NavySize: 34W x 36L,,"These are nice pants, but they’re very thin. They can’t be worn in this freezing cold weather and have to be saved for when it gets warmer out.",
Mariah,I wanted so badly to give 5 stars,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SWWADCWPOB0I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMN1N5DM,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Color: Dark NavySize: 42W x 30L,,The sizing was a bit off .I was very confused when he told me and didn’t believe it til I saw it. The material is nice the pockets are great they wash well but I just wish the sizing chart was a little more accurate. My hips are 45 in waist 35 and the pants I got were wayyy too big.,
Brian,Pretty Comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UH4DPTH77HP9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMN1N5DM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Color: Dark NavySize: 36W x 32L,,"These are nice pants.  They are a nice material that moves like normal pants would and not like a specially treated material.  They fit well and they seem like they will last for a while as well.  Overall, I've been pretty happy with these.",
Jenn M,Great pair of pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O1T151BVUXJ0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMN1N5DM,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",Color: Dark NavySize: 44W x 32L,,"These are a really great pair of pants, & really comfortable to wear. I got these for my spouse, & inadvertently ordered them in the wrong leg length (I meant to order a 46x34, & ordered a 46x32). It ended up being not as bad of an issue as I thought it would be, because the pants actually fit my spouse perfectly. These are lightweight & durable, & he really wants me to get more of these pants for him now. They are his new favorite pants to wear for any occasion. These are great work pants, as well as being nice enough to wear for dressy occasions like going out, or more formal occasions. These are breathable, wear well, & are water resistant. I highly recommend these.",
HoneyFitz,Heavy Duty Relaxed Cut Jeans,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OESTJ130PD57/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMN1N5DM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 20, 2025",Color: Dark NavySize: 42W x 32L,,"Nice deep Nay color,  rip stop resistant material,  water resistant as well.  Solid zipper and snap,  heavy duty belt loops,  100% cotton  - machine washable and dryer friendly - very heavy duty jeans.",
Buffet Buster,Nice Sturdy Work Pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CLCWF6JKEI2J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMN1N5DM,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: Dark NavySize: 34W x 30L,,"These are first-class pants for anyone needing durable, comfortable work wear.  Unlike some other heavy duty work pants, they are not stiff and fit comfortably.  I would characterize the fit as ""loose"" more than just relaxed, but they certainly do not look baggy.  While basically true-to-size, they do hang loosely which, in my case, at this time of year, is good, since it allows me to easily wear a pair of long johns underneath while working outside in cold weather. I can also surmise that these pants would be comfortable enough for rugged hiking.  I am quite pleased with these.  The only improvement I can suggest would be to include at least one pocket with a zipper closure to keep wallet and keys more secure.  The back pockets do have buttons, but with going up and down ladders, etc., I also worry a bit about stuff falling out.  Even considering that minor quibble, I find them good work pants.",
ReviewLoft,Great Pants!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31GOBIA2SL71F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMN1N5DM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Color: Dark NavySize: 32W x 30L,,These Bocomal pants fit true to size.  The fabric is that really cool rip stop design (imagine a pattern weaved with lots of tiny squares). I always liked rip stop -- and these are made of a very nice quality cotton. So far they've been through the wash once and no shrinkage was noted. Great pants option.,
Gary B.,Great for motorcycle,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KCTXXJOP5JYW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMN1N5DM,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Color: Dark NavySize: 44W x 30L,,I ordered these to use on my motorcycle. The flame and water resistant features make these perfect for that application. They go over my boots and fit well. Very pleased with this product. note: Look like jeans but not denim.,
Dylan,"Pretty nice pair of flame resistant pants, seem to run large.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UOK6AD246F8H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DMN1N5DM,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Color: Dark NavySize: 38W x 32L,,"I like these pants overall, though I will say they definitely seem to run on the larger size in regards to sizing. I am generally a 38/32 but for whatever reason these particular pants in 38x32 are really sortof way to big both in terms of waist and a bit in regards to height as well, so I'm guessing this brand just does there sizing a bit larger than typical, take this into consideration when ordering. Other than that, they definitely are flame resistant and do a fairly good job there, and the material they are made out of is SURPRISINGLY comfortable, soft, and flexible in comparison to other flame resistant work pants i've had experience with. These are somewhat cool to the touch, and seem to have a ripstop style fabric pattern. I would say $50 dollars is actually a fairly reasonable price point for pants like this, the one thing I think they could do better on is pockets, not a lot of variety or utility here, quite standard.",
