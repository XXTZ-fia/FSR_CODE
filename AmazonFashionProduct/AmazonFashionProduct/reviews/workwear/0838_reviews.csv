Lily,Cute and stylish 2 piece outfit!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37305T24VZVZ4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKHT9MSX,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Color: Black WhiteSize: X-Small,,"I have been looking for a dress pants/ button down vest combo for awhile now because I’ve been seeing them on Amazon in my recommended items. I love the polished, put together look- BUT I am extremely picky about the style and cut because I know those things can make or break an outfit. If they don’t look right or they aren’t well constructed, it won’t be flattering.  I finally hit the jackpot when I came across this cute two piece button down vest and pants set. I received it , tried it on- and it is everything I had hoped for. For one thing, it is very high quality. The top and pants are substantial and have some structure to them. They are not that cheap, flimsy fabric you often see. The quality is fantastic. The cut and style are figure flattering. The top has a row of buttons down the front and a slight flare at the bottom where there is no button. This makes the top fit SO much better and creates a much more chic and flattering look than buttons all the way down. The pants fit me perfectly and have a nice wide leg cut. The contrast of the fitted top and the flowy wide leg pants are what makes this outfit look so chic and stylish. You don’t want everything to be loose and flowy- you need something a little more fitted to contrast with the pants. That’s exactly what you get with this outfit! I also think each piece (the top and the pants) could be worn separately with other things in your closet, so you’re actually getting more bang for your buck at a great price. Every woman needs a great pair of black wide leg dress pants to wear to work/ church/ anywhere else. I paired the white top with a pair of chartreuse green dress pants in my closet to show how the top can do double duty and be worn with other things. I originally wanted to wear the top completely buttoned up but after seeing some more of the photos I’m going to play around with wearing it as a vest with another shirt underneath. Lots of different looks/ options with this 2 in 1 top and pants set. 5 stars!",

The vest is buttoned and fits with a nice tailored fitted look. The pants have partial elastic and a buttoned waistband in front.  The pants are also pleated.  This outfit is very much on the true-to size fit.  If you are a tall person, recommend attention to the sizing.  The length of the pants is more geared towards a shorter to average height.",

I was hoping to finally get pants that would fit me and additionally have a cute blazer to go with it. But sadly, the pants were too small. But the blazer fit perfectly. The pants actually fit my daughter to fits into a small. I’m a bit disappointed but at least I have a blazer 🤷‍♀️",
hp,Decent trendy vest and pant set,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDUOONBBN3VSG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKHT9MSX,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Color: Army GreenSize: X-Small,,"This stylish set is great for business wear. The quality of the textured fabric is decent and the material is thin (not see through). The vest has an inner lining and the pants don't, which I was disappointed about. The vest fits well on me and looks good with a white collar shirt underneath. The pants fit well at the waist because it is elastic. It's loose and flowy but it is fairly long on my petite body, which I plan to have them altered. Overall, a nice casual set great for spring or summer.",

The pants are a classic wide leg, look great on and are super comfortable with the elastic back. The fabric is soft and comfortable.

garet hunt,Professional and slimming,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FO635XRW9FQG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKHT9MSX,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Large,,"This professional-looking outfit will be great during warmer weather.  The top is lined and fairly tight-fitting (this might be an issue for those with a larger chest). The buttons and high neckline add to the professionalism.  The pants are high-waisted and flowing. They do a good job of hiding the bit of tummy I have. They are not lined and look a little more cheaply made if closely inspected, but I doubt it will matter to most. They almost hit the floor when not wearing any shoes, so they will work well with lower or higher heels.  The fit and monochrome black makes the outfit very slimming.  For reference, I am: 5'6"", 165 lbs, 36B, with a longer torso and shorter legs.",2

The pants are actually wider than they are shown in the pictures and almost look baggy. Even with the elastic waist, I still had to stretch the limit for it to fit. It wasn't uncomfortable but it gave a stretched ""look"". I am also 5'3"" and they fall at the perfect length with a kitten heel. The top is a whole other story. This did not fit AT ALL. Couldn't get it buttoned. The difference between top and bottom are way off.",

plumber@1024,"Pants are short, particularly if wear heels.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11ITHEA93AK42/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKHT9MSX,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: KhakiSize: Large,,"This outfit is quite nice. The fabric is smooth, the vest is fully lined, and the buttons are wrapped.  As you can see in the photos, the vest is too small for curvy women and the pants are too short, particularly if you are 5'8"" like me -- or you want to wear heels. I thought about letting them down, but there is not enough hem to let them down.  The pants have nice deep pockets and are true to size in the waist.",

The vest buttons were easy to button and unbutton. They are a good dude and adds nice detail to the overall look. Such a comfortable and timeless look. Very happy!",
The Pentagon,"Classy Style, Fits True to Size, Best in Darker Color",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROK7QAI4LG9AG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKHT9MSX,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: WhiteSize: X-Small,,"I ordered the white in this set in a size XS, and it fit me well as a size 0-2.  The style is classy, and I'm pleased with how the outfit looked and fit overall.  The one caveat is that the white top is lined, while the pants are not. So the top looks like an opaque white, and the pants look off-shade without the added lining (and you can see the pockets through it).  So if you want the white, you'll have to wear white leggings underneath to match the opacity of the top.  Or I'd recommend getting this set in a darker color, so this is not an issue.",
Jean,OK,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34C5I7SEZT6JW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKHT9MSX,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 12, 2025",Color: BlackSize: Medium,,"I got this in black.  The set is as pictured.  The quality of the fabric is not great, feels like a lower but not necessarily poor quality polyester and it has a little shininess to it in some lights.  That being said, the construction is well done. The weight is pretty light, will be good for warmer months.I am 5'9"", 140ish lbs, size 32B bra, and true US 6.  I usually wear a small or medium but err towards medium, especially in matching sets for the pants.  I feel like a small may have been a better fit.  I have room in the bust and armholes as well as a gap in the waistline of the pants (they have elastic on the back of the waist).I am on the taller side, and did not have issues with the length of the vest or pants like others mentioned.  That fit well to me.I machine washed cold, delicate cycle and hung to dry with no issues.",2

SilverStar,"the slacks don’t have any underlining, and the fabric is super thin and see-through!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FH1DRKPLM2V7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKHT9MSX,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Color: WhiteSize: Large,,"It has a lovely, flattering tailored design, and the top vest even comes with an underlining. However, the slacks don’t have any underlining, and the fabric is super thin and see-through—so make sure to pair them with opaque white underwear for a seamless look. You’ll also need to give the set a good ironing or consider professional starched dry cleaning to keep it looking crisp and polished. The wide-leg slacks feature an elastic waistband in the back, offering a comfy fit—especially if you’re rocking a little extra cutie patootie. It’s perfect for a casual business vibe or an easygoing summer travel outfit. Add a chic pair of strappy sandals and a lightweight tote, and you’re ready to slay the day!",
@PrincessKileyRae,The Top is Cute and the Trousers are Gigantic,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35WFO6LX22EF0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKHT9MSX,"4.0 "," the United States "," December 31, 2024",Color: BlackSize: X-Small,,"I ordered this two piece professional looking outfit set in the black color option which is my favorite color.  My first observation upon opening it was that the quality of the fabric seems pretty good.  It is a medium weight material, however it definitely still looks business appropriate and like something an adult would wear.  I appreciate that both items in this set are well made, sewn well, and constructed well.However, my critique will come down to the overall taste and look of the top and the bottom together as I do not feel they are cohesive at all.  The top is asymmetrical and sleeveless and buttons down the front.  I really like the way the top looks especially on the Amazon marketplace but it just doesn't look that same way in real life.I personally have a short torso and still find that the top is too short.  Realistically, it probably just needs another button on the front because the sides don't really meet together at the front-bottom which makes the top of the trousers visible where that gap is.  It's an unfortunate detail that really detracts from the whole look.The waistband of the high waisted trousers fits quite well and is true to size.  However, the amount of extra fabric on these loose-fitting pants is what I would definitely consider excessive.  There's just soooo much pants fabric.  I am a person who loves a voluminous garment especially, but in this case - it just makes the trousers look very sloppy and detracts from their business-like intentions.  I do understand that these are wide leg pants, however the width is just superfluous.Overall, I just really don't think the top and pants go together.  This is not a low quality garment set and it is sewn well and made from good fabric.  But, I just personally am not a fan of the overall look or fit of the pieces together.  I also absolutely despise the extremely oversized fit of the trousers which feels excessive and makes the pants look very sloppy.  I hate that the top is so business appropriate but then the pants just ruin it.  I wouldn't deter somebody from ordering this garment if you like it, but I would offer caution regarding the little quirks about the pants and especially about the top just not coming together appropriately in the front and looking odd.  It's not the worst outfit, but It's definitely not ideal for a professional look with such an unexpected fit among both garment pieces.",3
