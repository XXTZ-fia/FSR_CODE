The way it fits and all the pockets. Looks good too. I have worn it in 40-degree weather and it seems to keep me warm enough. The hood is the right size for my head. So far the bad part is the pockets. I am not sure if it is coming apart because of very cheap thread or, not enough material overlap. I got this jacket for work. Light physical work. You would think it should have gotten dirty before it starts falling apart. My oldest jacket that I have is just about 10 years old that I wash one or, two times a year. Still looks good. No holes or tears in or on it. I had another jacket that just laid down to rest that I used for work lasted 7 years. I picked that one up at Wal-Mart that made by Walls I believe. I am going back to that one next year. I don't think this jacket in going to last its first wash. So, if you are going to put anything else other than air in the lower side pockets. Look for another brand. And if I would have seen the washing instructions, I would not have brought this jacket. It is a shame. Because I really did like this jacket before the pockets started ripping apart.",
