I'm glad I didn't plan on using it for anything else though. It does look like the photo - which is good! But it's a bit thin, so if you aren't wearing anything underneath it (as I did for my costume), I might have some doubts. Also - my biggest problem with this - if you want to keep the sleeve cuffs buttoned, you WILL lose all your circulation. It is not proportional to the fit of the rest of the shirt! The shirt fit me fine, but there was absolutely no way (even with undershirt removed) to bend my elbows with the sleeve cuffs buttoned. They must remain unbuttoned at all times, otherwise your arms will be in a world of pain. It hurt terribly even after just a few minutes while buttoned.  That being said though, it's definitely cute! It's comfortable otherwise. It's worthwhile for sure if you have small arms and don't mind that it's a little bit sheer.",14
