I am very disappointed in the quality. These were a much lighter fabric than what they used to be. Unfortunately the return window is closed. Just got off the phone with Dickies looks like they are going to honor a warranty and send me 2 new pair. I guess bottom line is don't buy them from Amazon, buy them directly from Dickies or a brick and mortar retailer that you can check them out in person before purchase. I will update after warranty process is complete.",
