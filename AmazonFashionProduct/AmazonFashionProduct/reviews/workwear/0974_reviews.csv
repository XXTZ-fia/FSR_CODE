aaron c/o vanguard,low rise nonsense,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OX42ZW73PFGV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08DQPM6MT,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 8, 2025",Color: Timber V1Size: 34W x 30L,Verified Purchase,I really wanted to like these. I wear the regular weight dickies carpenter pants for work but they are just a little bit too tight for my liking. sadly they are so ridiculously low rise that wearing them for actual work where you have to kneel over and pick things up is completely pointless as they just ride down and cause your boxers to get all twisted up. I am just literally constantly readjusting my boxers and tucking my shirt in over and over and over again when I wear these.I've tried with like four or five different belts now and it's the same story. Throwing them away sadly. Why do manufacturers make low rise work pants. I will never understand it,
