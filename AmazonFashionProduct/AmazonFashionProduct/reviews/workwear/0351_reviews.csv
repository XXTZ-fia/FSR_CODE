Slim fit, casual fit, loose fit, classic fit, athletic fit, etc.  makes it impossible to just say waist and inseam and know if something is going to fit.  Dickies is truly the worse for this.  I have worn 874s for decades.  Everyone knows you have to go up a size or two on the waist to what you would normally wear.  I figured these would be the same, they look like 874s but I thought the “slim fit” would make the legs a little less baggy.  I ordered the same waist as I order for 874s and they are a size to big.  Even though they are supposed to be “slim”. I wish you could just order the size based on your measurements, or it would at least be consistent across a single manufacturer.",2
