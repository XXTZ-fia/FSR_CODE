Prior lines of Cherokee have been great.  I went with these because they are advertised as stretching and easy care.  Couldn't be further from the truth.  These things wrinkle so bad coming out of the dryer no matter what setting you use.  And they also attract lint like nobody's business.  I spend 30+ minutes trying to iron them after spending just as long getting all the lint off.  No more Cherokee for me.  These also fit very baggy so suggest getting next size down should you choose to purchase.,
