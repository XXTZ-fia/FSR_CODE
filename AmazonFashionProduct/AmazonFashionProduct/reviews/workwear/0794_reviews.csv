She wore it several times in early spring, and she reports that it is very nice. The open look works well with her chosen ""work casual"" appearance. The material is quite light, making it useful even on some warmer days. Although thin, the fabric is soft, and the deep color is understated, which my wife prefers. The sweater combines well with jeans or other casual wear. The fit is accurate, as cited in the product description. The pockets are located in a good spot, and they are deep enough for my wife's hands, but the sweater material is just a bit too thin to put anything too heavy in them.

It shipped well with minimal shipping. It did not emit any weird smells or alarming odors.  I'm five foot two and a half inches tall, 120lbs, 32DD, and typically wear a size small. I sport a pear-shaped petite figure. That said,  this cardigan fits me fairly well. Sometimes smalls fit too tightly on my arms but this fit my arms just fine. It is a few inches shorter in the front than in the back. On my body, it falls about 2-3 inches below the end of my bottom.  It is fitted enough that it drapes down to a point that it doesn't make me look wide or frumpy.  I adore the pockets. The pockets have enough space for my hands to rest in but not just. I often home my phone in one of the pockets and small items like a hanky and a lip balm or lipstick and if going out my keys.  The 100% Viscose material is lightweight yet it still sports a great warmth. It is soft and not itchy at all. I am often wearing this on cool mornings and will certainly be reaching for it during the Fall, Winter, and Early Spring season.  I have machine-washed this cool and let it hang to dry. It has not shrunk, pilled, or faded. It lends to not wrinkle.  I like it can be worn open or tied shut with the belt. I liked wearing it with dresses as well as tops and jeans. It can be dressed up and down pretty easily.  I really like this cardigan and feel it's a great staple for the wardrobe.",
