Allows for good flexibility and a lot of movement.  If you're looking for style this is not your jeans.  Now the reason for three stars.  The pockets on the back of the legs are to low. If I have something in those pockets and I have to stoop down whatever is in those pockets gets in the way of my knees. The pencil pocket is on the left side. I am right handed. That just doesn’t work. And, the pencil pockets are too short and should be three-dimensional and a little wider. The hammer loop is a joke. Too small for any kind of hammer I know of. The back pockets are too big. Regular conventional jean pockets would be the right size. That small pocket in the front that would be the fifth pocket on regular jeans is way too big. If I put something in there it’s hard to get it out. I’m guessing this was designed by a clothing designer without any input from a real carpenter. That was very unfortunate. The same jeans with the same material with a few minor adjustments would’ve been great.",3

Since those wore so well and I'm getting older and don't do as much knee work anymore I thought I'd go a bit cheap and pick up these pants. While I'm sure they will last quite a while and fit great, I'm kicking myself for not reading the description completely. Contractor pants have a Utility loop while Carpenter pants have a Hammer loop. Which I guess makes sense - Carpenters use hammers, thus a Hammer loop; Contractors just drive around mostly and need a place to hang their keys, thus a Utility loop. As you can see, I can barely fit my fingers in that loop, maybe better suited for a cordless drill or nailer, idk.",6

When I got them they seemed to be well made and fit good but I noticed the denim seemed a bit thin ( which is a problem with most jeans these days) but since I worked in a hot parts department I didn’t think it would be that bad. Initially they gave good service, and they even had a reinforced crotch which if you’ve had a blowout there you’ll either go to the nearest store or home to fix. For about 6 months they were in rotation being worn 4 days a week ( 2 days for each pair) one day I noticed the leg on one pair near the ankle was beginning to come apart. Eventually that area failed and a significant portion was missing and I had to pull that pair from service. The next pair started to wear out in the crotch and the denim pilled badly. Ended up giving them away to a local goodwill as they were no longer in an acceptable condition for working in. They fit comfortably but the denim was not strong enough for regular actual work activity. My suggestion would be to use the denim from the outdoors clothing line also by wrangler. Those jeans last and last",7
