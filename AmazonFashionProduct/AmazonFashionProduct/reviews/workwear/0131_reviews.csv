They are actually luxurious in softness, comfort, thickness, weight and appearance.  I chose three of these superior quality shirts as a gift for my grandson in college. These well-made shirts are manufactured in hard-to-find “Tall” sizes and are available in over 30 colors. My grandson is very thin and tall (6'4"") and wears a Tall Large shirt. The short sleeve Tee shirts have several nice features.  PROS: (No CONS observed). * High-quality short sleeve pocket Tee shirts have excellent materials and construction throughout.  * Fabric is 100% heavyweight jersey-knit Cotton, pre-shrunk for excellent fit after washing and drying.  * Pull-on shirt is comfortable to wear, especially in the hot, summer months.  100% natural Cotton fiber is well-known among clothing and fiber artists for its soft and smooth fine hand, durability and breathability.  * Excellent construction and attention to detail - tag less labeling for comfort; long tail for active physical work accommodates both tucked-in-or-out styles.  All seams are perfectly flat and double stitched; neck and shoulder seams are reinforced with taping that prevents stretching; all sewing is done in an extremely professional manner for strength, comfort and durability.  * Traditional chest pocket with separate pen or pencil slot is neatly sewn and blends into the shirt so inconspicuously that I didn't notice it until I took the close-up photos!  * Stylish Tee can be worn alone or as a complementary undershirt.  * Easy care shirts are machine washable and dry able. They maintain their excellent color and smooth appearance through numerous washings, yet never look “washed-out.”  SUMMARY: These well-made Tee shirts are designed and manufactured by a company that has been in business for almost 103 years (since 1922). Dickies offers high-quality products with superior craftsmanship at a very fair price.  You won't be disappointed!  Enjoy! Highly Recommended.",5

Again, if you want a heavyweight shirt, go buy a carhartt.  Secondly, this large fits like a medium. I wear a tall large in carhartt which is big on me and this large makes me feel like a fat guy in a little coat.
