I’m 5’1 1/2 and 125 lbs. small would probably fit me nicely but I don’t want it to be tight so I bought medium which is perfect and so comfortable. For me if you’re going to an interview you definitely wna look conservative.  Ladies, I guess it’s your preference. If you have same height and weight as me, buy small if you want it to be flattering and fit. Buy medium if you want to be comfortable and if u don’t mind it being a slightly loose on you.  I chose medium bcos I want to breathe freely without worrying about my stomach and so that I can walk comfortably. I hope this helps!!
