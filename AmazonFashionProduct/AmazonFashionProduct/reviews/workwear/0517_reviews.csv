I returned this pair to buy those instead (trading at an inn???).  The other, ‘skinny’ type listed on Amazon have a small pocket on the back of one thigh (a dealbreaker for most) and are bizarrely skin-tight — not much thought placed into the design of those.  In addition, a certain store stocks a chill store-exclusive baggier but nicely tapered cut (like the kind you used to see on skateboarders in the aughts or ‘90s). Know your options!  573 — just a better version of these “slim / straight” Dickies.",
