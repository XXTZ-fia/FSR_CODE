I really like how these feel on my skin. The elastic isn't too tight, it's comfortable. Elastic around the ankles is good too. It feels sorta baggy at the ankles.  Mine don't look like the photo. So I don't find these flattering but they are quite comfortable which is pretty important. Not sure why there's a drawstring since there's elastic but no complaints. Feels light like I'm wearing pj's.",

They are quality made material; very soft and comfortable material. Fits true to size. Love the dark gray color. Pockets work well for carrying my phone and other items; very convenient. Worth the cost.,

X.,"Fantastic, true to size fit",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O8W7Y7WLCHUE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D529HXCN,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 11, 2024",,,"Incredible fit! Comfortable, easy to move around in, and looks really great. I always say whenever you’re ordering scrubs keep in my that they can vary in fit from company to company. These however, are true to size. If you’re a large, order a larger. Though, I will say, they do flair a little in the thighs.  Lots of deep pockets (which is always a deciding factor for me personally!) Love these so much and will be ordering more very soon!",
N,Comfortable to wear.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30GNTR80H3L5R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D529HXCN,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 28, 2024",,,"These scrubs are comfortable to wear and the band is thick, I won’t have to worry about the band flipping around after washing. The material and the strings are thick. I think it should be warm enough for winter without needing to wear leggings underneath like I do my other scrub pants. It has leg, front, and back pockets. I don’t use the back pockets but it’s nice to have the option lol. The side pockets are big enough to hold my phone (i14PM) and the right one is zippered. I like how they fit overall and that they’ve passed my squat test.",
Kat,ALMOST perfect,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LBNXVYL0XQ2X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D529HXCN,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 19, 2024",,,"I have almost no complaints for these; they're extremely comfortable and I feel like they're going to stand up against the test of time versus my thighs. Almost all pants end up losing the war to my thighs, especially scrub pants.  However, the only downside is that if you're like me and you change for work before leaving the house.... Everyone's going to be able to tell what kind of pets you have. These things attract hair, it's easy to wipe off, but they still attract them pretty strongly.",
K&J,Comfy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R71XENPEQROD2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D529HXCN,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 17, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Navy Blue,,"I ordered size large, I am 5'6"", 205lbs, I have been losing weight, so I never know what size will fit best, but size Large has been working well for me, and these fit me great! They are not my favorite color, I ordered Navy Blue, but these are not navy, they were more green, like jade maybe? But since I ordered them for lounge-wear/around the house, I don't really mind the color.  They are very comfortable, I have previously been a CNA and an MA, and I would've been happy running around working in these.",
CLC,outstanding scrubs,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1L4I0QQNTFU9X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D529HXCN,"5.0 "," the United States "," July 16, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Wine,,"The scrubs are comfortable and cool to wear.

M H,Really 4.5 stars for these joggers,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3US0AG7NJ9HNY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D529HXCN,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 16, 2024",,,"I really like to wear joggers and I really like pockets. I wasn't sure how scrubs would be as joggers but I gave it a try. I usually wear XL in pants and these fit maybe just a bit small but not too small to wear. There's enough stretch that the close to the body fit is not uncomfortable. The ankle cuffs are really tall and actually a bit narrow and they really hug my ankles. Length puts them right at the top of my foot. Pockets are small. Typical size for women's clothes. I was hoping my phone could go in the zipper pocket, but it's a bit small for that. It is secure though.  Material is about what you would expect, soft and breathable, easy care, wrinkle-free. Plenty of room in the waist but the additional tie is nice. Overall, a functional and flattering pair of scrub pants.",

Love the cuff at the heel to avoid them dragging on the floor.  Lightweight and comfortable with an easily adjustable waistband that sits flat. Arrives virtually wrinkle free and is easy care machine wash. True to size M for a wide range of sizes.,
Vérité,"Nice Extra Pockets, but Basic Material",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR4I733OQSXA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D529HXCN,"4.0 "," the United States "," July 9, 2024",,,The material is basic thin polyester and the tie at the waist is a cheesy shoelace style tie. The pockets are nice and the zippered pocket is well done and zippers smoothly. They are comfortable to wear and I like them overall but wish the fabric was better quality.,
