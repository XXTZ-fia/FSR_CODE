Ratio,A Durable and Stylish Flannel for Cooler Weather,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21Z8OL7A88WTQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095XPVQNZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 26, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Copper/Black-503,Verified Purchase,"The Smith’s Workwear Men’s Buffalo Pocket Flannel Button-Up Shirt is a great blend of comfort, durability, and style. Here’s what stood out:  Pros: 1. Comfortable Fabric: The flannel is soft and warm, perfect for colder months. It feels great against the skin and provides all-day comfort. 2. Durable Construction: The stitching and overall build quality are impressive. It holds up well after multiple washes without fading or pilling. 3. Functional Design: The pockets are spacious and well-placed, adding both style and utility. It’s perfect for carrying small essentials like a phone or wallet. 4. Stylish Look: The buffalo plaid design is timeless, making it a versatile piece for casual outings or layering over a t-shirt.  Cons 1. Fit: The sizing runs slightly large, so consider sizing down if you prefer a more tailored look. 2. Weight: It’s on the heavier side, which is great for warmth but may not be ideal for mild weather.  Overall This flannel shirt is a fantastic addition to any wardrobe for those who value comfort, durability, and classic style. It’s ideal for outdoor activities or casual wear in cooler weather. Highly recommend!",

The black and white flannel was a great feeling drape, soft on outside but decent weight or structure, nothing like a Walmart or old navy flannel. It is perfect over a t shirt open and not too hot. I wonder if it’s because it is 20% polyester. Plus it washes without wrinkling too much and doesn’t mess up the collar. I recommend it and will buy it in red",
