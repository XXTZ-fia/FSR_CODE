I love this jacket! It is as thin as a shirt but looks good and has pockets and a collar.  In the colder weather you can wear a sweatshirt underneath with a hood. This jacket is great for everyday wear. Is sturdy as heck and lasts years even with many washes. The jacket obviously becomes softer with a little wear whereas its quite stiff at first. Oh I totally recommend this jacket! Its great for patches too. The lined Eisenhower jacket is great as well for colder weather Like under 60' ish. I wear the thin jacket all through spring , fall and summer and the lined during the winter. If you have never worn one of these jackets I totally say, Dickies is cool! From skater wear to rockabilly and punk or metal workers , whatever your style or work I highly recommend it because it will last you years and is totally worth the money. The only downfall is there aren't enough pockets, inside pockets would be better i think. Although there is a 'kind-of' inside pocket it isn't sewn to be a proper pocket. Overall yay Dickies Iv been wearing you for 30 years!!",9

It actually felt like a good coat. Comfortable and nice strong zipper. The pockets were large and deep enough for whatever you need as well as inside pockets in the same area as the outside but smaller. Nice all around coat. If I fit that size, I would have kept it.  So for a rating of the actual Eisenhower Jacket, I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.",
