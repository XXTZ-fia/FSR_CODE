Regardless, scrubs appeared to be extremely comfortable, and often preferable to my ""Haggar Men's Classic Khakis"".  Eighteen months ago I bought my first set from a local store, and paid about $45 for the bottoms.  I liked them.  Fast forward to today, and I had a need for a ""new-looking"" version, so I experimented with Amazon's offering:  Same brand, same model line, same dimensions.  The $17 A offering, to me, is better.  Same excellent fit, somewhat loose, yet not at all ""blousy"".  The fabric is now lighter, perhaps having more polyester, but I like that.  The drawstrings are improved.  I'm quite pleased and will likely buy more.",

Room for good ROM without stretching too much and has a modern cut to it (not baggy). Length is good with shoes on but may touch the floor when shoes are off for me.  Wish the left lower thigh had a pocket though and a touch on the shiny side otherwise would give 5 stars. The shine may get less with a few washes.,

First time i wore these, my wallet fell out twice before I realized it was the pants. It was a cold morning and my hands couldnt fit into the pockets at all. Also, they sag. They have a drawstring and button up feature but still sag due to the spandex material, which is why i bought them. They look clean, are flexible and soft. But you will eventually want to use the pockets and theyre useless. Plus, they sag to the point where i step on the hem, which means eventually the bottom of the pants will have wear and tear from being walked on. Id go a different collection fro Cherokee.

This is important as the size chart has me in between and once my question was answered I was convinced short was the way to go. Big mistake!!!!! If I could I would order medium medium with navy since those looked nice. If you have never tried these on in person, I would say skip they are a unique fit",

They were def better than the scrub pants provided to me (for free) by my company, being that they are less baggier around the calf area. I would def purchase these again if need be! Just ordered a ""jogger"" type one of this brand because I was satisfied with the one that i received. We'll see how that goes.. If you're on the fence about trying these out, I suggest ""go for it"" considering the value in price you'll get out of them. They'll be useful in your rotation for sure!",2
