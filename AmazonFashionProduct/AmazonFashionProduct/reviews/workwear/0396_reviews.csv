I wanted something slim fitting with a more traditional pant/jean cut and these fit and flex really well.  Like other reviewers mention, the fabric is soft and relatively lightweight compared to something like Carhartt duck fabric.  You will wear through these pretty fast if you're doing anything that looks like work.The right-thigh pockets are the killer feature here and cannot be understated how excellent the pocket is designed.  Personally, I can't stand carrying phones in one of the usual four pants pockets.  And cargo pockets are shaped improperly to hold a phone.  The main right-thigh pocket is great for any size phone.  It is also partially closed on the top creating an angled entry.  This means your phone won't slip out when you're sitting slightly reclined (unlike far more expensive pants with a similar pocket location).  The smaller right-thigh pocket is perfect for pencils and markers and makes them easy to reach while you're laying out cuts.The one thing that keeps these from replacing basically 80% of the pants in my closet is the hammer loop.  I've looked at literally every Dickies pants to see if I can get the the same style without the hammer loop and it doesn't exist.  Without the hammer loop (that is probably useful to like 2% of tradesman anyway), these could even be worn as business casual.  These would be the ideal travel pants: comfy on the airplane, barely dressy enough for a business meeting, and tough enough on the job site.Dickies: Please make these exact same pants without the hammer loop and I'll make a lifetime purchase to account for replacing these as they wear out :)",8

I usually wait until the hole is the size of a quarter before I retire them into cut off shorts, which can be several wears and washes.  Carhartts only last about 6 months for me before I blow them out in the crotch, and for me, when they blow, it’s out of nowhere and your shorts or butt cheeks are hangin out until you can double up tape from the inside to outside against eachother over the hole.
