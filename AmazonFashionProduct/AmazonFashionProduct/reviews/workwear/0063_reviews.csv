Third time I wore them the seam at the waistband popped open from the front of the right hand pocket to the middle of the back, great to have happen at work when you have 3 hours left to work. Disappointing garbage. I have Dickies I've had for close to 10 years that were just starting to wear out so I wanted to get more and thought Dickies would be a good option after having 5 pairs for 10 years and apparently they don't even try anymore like every other well known company. Glad I only bought one pair.

The perfect pants for work or play.  The surprising part is no one is successfully copying this Dickies style for design, cut, proportions, pickets, or material. So Dickies owns this market completely, except there are a few others at 2-3X the cost that can't be purchased on Amazon (so good luck with sizing and returns with those companies).  65% poly and 35% cotton, which is fine. Limits shrinkage (almost none), extends durability, keeps them lightweight, wash any way you want to without penalties, etc.  This is the standard so others should copy it, but Dickies pricing is very competitive anyway so people would likely still choose Dickies.",
