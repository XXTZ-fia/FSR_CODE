Rebekah,"Good basic scrub top, size down",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R390MKM7ZX65OH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09NR28CZ3,"5.0 "," the United States "," November 11, 2021",Size: X-SmallColor: Navy,Verified Purchase,"I like these unisex scrubs much better than most of the women's scrubs I've worn.  I like this top because it is super comfortable, no low front pockets only one chest pocket so I can tuck it in if I want although it looks fine untucked, and it's inexpensive at $12 so I'm not worried about blood stains etc.  I need to be able to throw my scrubs in the trash if necessary, iykyk.  No $80 scrub sets for me.  I'm 5'6"", ~148 lbs, in bottoms I usually wear size 8 or medium, tops either small or medium.  I have an athletic body type that can be difficult to fit because I strength train regularly so I have muscular shoulders and upper back, so with some tops I have to size up to fit my upper back but then it's way too baggy everywhere else.  This top is perfect for my body type and allows plenty of room and movement for my arms/shoulders/upper back.  The Small was a little too roomy, I ordered the XS and it's perfect.  These do shrink a tiny bit, and they're stiff until they've been washed a few times.  I wear these with the same brand Cherokee Workwear men's model 4000 pants in size small bc they have a higher waist that holds up to all of the stuff I hook on my pants (shears and ears etc) and they have cargo pockets on both sides which is especially important since this top only has the one chest pocket.  This top is almost identical in color to the Cherokee Workwear Revolution WW120 pants that I also own, close enough to wear together if I want.",8
