Upon initial inspection noted a number of seams where the threads were loose or at least ends hanging out.  See a few example photos. There were enough instances where I did not feel comfortable just trimming and keeping the vest. Returned without wearing.  The vest has many good Amazon reviews. This was hopefully an isolated quality issue.,

Very happy with it.  The inside is smooth and comfy.  Pockets have zippers.  Nice fit.  Great price.
