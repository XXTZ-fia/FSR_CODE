Also, I was shocked by the fact that there is a wear-whole on the back of them! In an unusual spot as well, not in a place they would be rubbed. It's just cheap material. How disappointing. Also, they are impossible to keep wrinkle free - this was another thing I don't remember from the last time I owned them. You can iron them, but right after you put them on, wrinkled. I bought a pair in Navy blue as well, and I suppose because they're blue they will last longer, but the black isn't made to last anymore, which is a shame.",
