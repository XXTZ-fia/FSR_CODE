anders nelson,Side pockets are criminally small,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX9DG0VOU4T45/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BFGYRTW,"3.0 "," the United States "," October 7, 2022",Size: SmallColor: Navy,Verified Purchase,"Everything is great about these pants except ONE thing…  The side pockets are TOO SMALL. During my last shift my IPhone 11 (without a case, have you) slid out of my pocket on at least six different occasions as I was sitting or in the act of sat down.  Just for reference, the stitching on the pant which outlines each side pocket measures about 7”H x 5”W (check the images for reference), which exceeds the dimensions of the iPhone by ~2 inches on each side. This is not a problem standing. However when you sit, the material around the pocket inevitably creases and it’s capacity shrinks much smaller. If you have a generally modern full-size smartphone, you’ll either find it a) gaping out the corner, b) actually slipping out, or c) stretching the material around your leg and awkwardly bulging out the side.  That said, I’m 5’9 and 150lb and wear a size small mens for pants. I would bet there’s a good chance that the pockets are bigger on larger pant sizes. This may be worth looking into because these are GREAT pants otherwise.",

I  am 5’9” and weigh 160 and the Mediums fit me well in height and the thighs.  They have a lot of give in the fabric that doesn’t make it feel too tight when sitting. The fabric is water resistant so water just beads up on it at first.  The waste is elastic but not uncomfortable and the front does have a tie hidden inside the waste band to tighten if needed but I don’t use them.  The only thing is that they get hot easily if wearing outdoors in heat.  But pretty much any synthetic fabrics do that.  Overall I’m happy with them.,3

I suggest considering one down from the size chart. I am 6’ 2” and weigh 240 pounds. My waist is 45-46. The size chart suggests 3XL short. I ordered that size, and it was wearable but too large. I ordered another pair, size 2XL short, and they fit very well.  There is a great deal of stretch in the waist elastic, and the drawstring is a mile long. I will probably trim the ends off the drawstring so it doesn’t hang on the floor when you are in the bathroom. The “short” size is pretty much a true 29 inches. The material is very thin, and that may be a plus or minus for some people.",6
