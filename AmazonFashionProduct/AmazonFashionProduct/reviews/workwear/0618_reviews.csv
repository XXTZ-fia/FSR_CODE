Kevin S.,"Very comfortable, light-weight cargo pants, I just don't care for mesh pockets.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R347NHSQA55XLG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07798SW5B,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 6, 2018",,,"I have one pair of the 5.11 Tactical Stryke Pant and one pair of the 5.11 Fast-Tac Cargo Pants.  I like both of them for the Flex-Tac fabric and the self-adjusting tunnel waistband.  I just don't like the look and feel of elastic waistbands.  These look like regular fitted pants, but the self-adjusting tunnel allows the waist to give a little like elastic waistbands do.  In both pants, I like the cargo pockets with side bellows because I use the side pockets a lot.  I also looked at and considered the Apex pants and the Tac-Lite Pro pants in the store, but the Apex side pockets were pretty small and tight, not bellowed, and the Tac-Lite Pro pants have that strange strap thing on the back to carry a large tool or flashlight of some sort.Where the Stryke pants and Fast-Tac Cargo pants are different:1.  Cargo Pockets.  In the Stryke pants, they put inside the cargo pocket some smaller sub-pockets to hold magazines, and they frustrate me to no end.  I like to be able to one-handed with something in my hand lift up the flap and just slide the item into the cargo pocket, pushing it against my thigh and sliding down into the pocket.  I can't do that with the Stryke pants.  As it try pushing something down into the cargo pockets, it catches on the smaller magazine pockets.  It basically forces me into a two-handed operation where one hand has to hold the cargo pocket open while the other hand carefully navigates the item into the pocket while avoiding the magazine sub-pockets.  I'm thinking I might take a pair of scissors and cut out the magazine sub-pockets.  So that's an up-check for the Fast-Tac Cargo Pants.  They have the same bellowed cargo pockets for extra capacity, but they don't have the inner magazine pockets.  So I can slide things in and out of the pockets on the Fast-Tac Cargo pants.2.  Pocket material.  The Fast-Tac Cargo pants are made of a lighter weight Flex-Tac fabric than the Stryke pants, which is fine.  I suspect they might be cooler in warmer weather, but I haven't tested it yet.  What I don't like about the Fast-Tac Cargo pants is that the inside of the pockets (the main front and back pockets) are made of mesh.  I don't care for that personally.  I prefer the Stryke pants which have solid fabric for the inside of the pockets.",4
