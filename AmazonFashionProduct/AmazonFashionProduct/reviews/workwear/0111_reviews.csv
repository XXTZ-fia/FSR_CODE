The material on the outside is indeed sturdy, but that's about where the positives end. First of all, the fit was a major issue for me. I ordered my usual size, but it fit much looser than I anticipated, and not in a good way. The loose fit makes it difficult to layer properly with other clothing, which defeats the purpose of wearing something like this in the winter. It feels bulky and not form-fitting at all, leaving me with less warmth since it doesn't trap the heat in the right places. The length was another issue. It wasn't long enough to provide coverage over the waist, which is essential for me when I’m wearing it in colder temperatures. I found myself constantly tugging at the bottom to make sure my torso stayed warm, which was frustrating. Moving to the Sherpa lining, it is soft to the touch, but it doesn't do a great job of keeping you warm for long periods of time. It feels like it doesn't breathe well either, which causes me to sweat more than I'd like, especially when doing light physical activities outdoors. It's not as insulated as I expected, leaving me chilled after being outside for a while. I also found the material to be pretty stiff, making it uncomfortable to wear for extended periods. The supposed ""mock-neck"" design didn't really provide any extra warmth either. It was short and didn't keep my neck insulated like I thought it would, leaving me exposed to the cold wind. The zipper quality also left a lot to be desired. It felt flimsy, and it snagged multiple times during use, which led to a lot of irritation. After a few wears, it seemed like the zipper would be the first thing to break. As for the pockets, they are decent, but not roomy enough to store anything more than a couple of small items. I expected them to be deeper or at least have some kind of closure to secure things, but unfortunately, they just had flaps that didn’t stay closed well. After a few uses, I noticed the fabric started to lose its color in certain areas, particularly on the sleeves and sides. The washed look was nice when I first got it, but the fading gave it a worn-down appearance much too quickly. For the price, I really expected better durability and performance. Additionally, the fabric on the outside doesn’t seem like it would stand up to the elements for long. I’ve had other vests with similar materials that have lasted me for years, but this one seems like it won’t hold up to much wear and tear. The Sherpa lining, while soft, is not thick enough to make it truly suitable for the colder months. If you live in an area with mild winters, it might work, but for anyone who deals with real cold, it just isn’t going to cut it. One of the things that bugged me the most was the overall lack of attention to detail in the stitching and finish. I noticed a few loose threads right out of the box, and that’s always a sign of poor quality control. The seams on the inside of the vest felt uneven, and the overall construction seemed rushed. I get that it's marketed as a workwear item, but it still needs to have more attention given to the finer details to ensure it lasts. It’s not just about the exterior; it's also about the interior construction and how well everything holds up after wearing it for a while. The vest's appearance isn't bad at first glance, but after a couple of washes and a few wears, it’s obvious that it’s not built to last. The comfort is also hit or miss; sometimes it feels alright, but other times, the stiffness really gets to me, especially if I’m wearing it for hours. The product doesn’t have that soft, well-worn feel that I was expecting, even after a few washes. I really wanted to like it, but after wearing it for a while, I just couldn’t get past its shortcomings. While it has potential, it simply falls short in terms of warmth, comfort, and durability. Honestly, I don’t think I’ll be using it for long, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who needs something for real winter conditions or for those looking for quality workwear.",

I opted for the blue, and it's a deep TARDIS blue, in my opinion; a little more interesting than a plain navy blue. The only things I don't like is the bright white branding tag on the dark blue, and that the vest came with a lifetime warranty if you email, but every email I attempt bounces back.

CONS: - For those who note things like this (like my husband does) - the zipper is ""backwards"" from what the zipper is on most men's clothing - i.e., the zipper pull is on the L side which is primarily how women's clothes are, whereas it should be on the right. - The opening to the front pockets is a bit too high and could be lower. I suspect the opening is higher because these are open pockets, and that may prevent contents from falling out. However, it bothered my husband that the openings are as high as they are.  SIZING: Ordering usual size should work. In the Large this should fit my older teen son who wears size Large just right, with some extra room. For reference he's 6'1"" tall, lanky build. My husband wears an XL, Even though my husband wears an XL, this in Large actually does fit - see the pics with the review, that's him. If I was ordering this for him I would go with his usual size of XL so he needed to he could wear a heftier layer underneath if working outside in colder weather.

Biggins48,Nice Quality Sherpa-Lined Vest - Loose Fitting in the Middle,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UTTU6PZWI8MY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9PYM1HQ,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 5, 2024",Color: Brown DuckSize: X-Large,,"I picked up this men's canvas vest because fall is coming, and I've been doing a lot of work outside lately. I usually prefer hoodies, but living in Minnesota, sometimes the weather can be too warm for them, especially when you're active outdoors. I was looking for a balance between a hoodie and just wearing a t-shirt or long-sleeve shirt.  The overall quality of the vest is very good. The fabric feels strong and is on par with other popular brand canvas vests. One thing I struggled with was choosing the right size. I have broader shoulders, and my measurements fell well into the extra-large size. However, I was also concerned about the length, so I didn't want to go too small. I ended up going with the extra-large.  The vest fits well overall; however, it's very roomy around the midsection. I don't have a big stomach or waistline, so it's roomier than I would prefer. The length is good, so if I had gone with a large, that might have been too short. It's definitely usable—it fits perfectly in the shoulders, is a bit too big in the midsection, but the length is just about perfect. I'd sum it up by saying this is not a fitted vest. It's something you can work in and have plenty of room without feeling restricted when twisting and moving around.  The fabric on the inside is nice and will definitely keep your midsection warm. I also like the deep pockets, especially the zippered one on the chest. I'm able to fit my entire hand in with it open, so the pocket has plenty of room.  Overall, for the price you pay versus the value you get, I think this is a good vest. If you need extra room in the midsection, this will definitely be for you. I'm 5'10"" and weigh about 195 lbs. Most of my weight is in my shoulders, so as I mentioned, the midsection is a little looser than I expected.  Pros: - Good quality, strong fabric - Comfortable and warm interior - Deep pockets with ample space - Fits well in shoulders and length  Cons: - Roomy around the midsection; not a fitted vest - Sizing can be tricky for those with broader shoulders but smaller waist",7
Arthur,Warm and Comfy Vest,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1A8AVXFBJN58O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D9PYM1HQ,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 27, 2024",,,"This is a well-made vest,  fully lined with a thick fleece, including around the collar. I attach a photo of the interior with the vest draped over my office chair.  This vest is actually a winter jacket without sleeves. I am planning to wear it during what is expected to be a chilly Fall  afternoon while attending an upcoming football game. The outside is a very tough cotton fabric that appears to be able to stand up to the abuse that would incur from working outdoors. I will test this out in a  few days when I rake leaves. There is a small zipper pocket on the left front that is just large enough to hold a phone. I like that.  I have had issues with zippers breaking on vests that I have worn in the past, causing the vest to be either discarded or require an expensive repair. But not with this HISEA vest which, the attached tag says, offers a lifetime warranty",5
