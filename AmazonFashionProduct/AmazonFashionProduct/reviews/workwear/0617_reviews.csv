Never had a problem.  What I dislike is the hook and bar closure instead of a button.  The second unimprovement is the cell phone pocket use to span the side seam centered on the side of the thigh.  The new version has the cell phone pocket behind the side seam.  You literally sit on your phone if you sit.  WTH y'all thinking.,

You'll need to keep a couple of things in mind.  1. The sizing is incredibly unreliable. But, I've never had too loose. I'm 5'9"", 155/160lbs (normally wear 31 or 32 x 32). These pants sit right at you waist, as in your proper waist. So the reason you should size up is if you prefer you pants to sit below your waist(which is what I prefer with 33x32). I also don't tuck in my shirts, so the bagginess around the butt doesn't bother me at all.  2. The product says they are ""flex/stretch"". I find this to be total BS. If anything it flexes 1 to 2 millimeters, not enough to make a difference in my opinion.  But for me at least, sizing up solved my issue.",

For reference, I am 6' 2"" and 150lbs. The fit of these pants can vary, sometimes drastically, from pair to pair.  I've seen some reviewers say to buy a size up, but I've found that only complicates the matter. Instead, it's been easier for me to just buy a few at a time, try them on, and keep only what fits. (Gotta love Prime Try-Before-You-Buy).  No one sells Dickies anywhere near me, but for anyone close to a reseller, I'd recommend just trying them on in-store, it'd make things much simpler.  Otherwise, these are nice pants. The material is stiff when new, but it will soften up considerably after a wash or two. As with most things these days, quality control is all over the board, however, considering that I can get Dickies for about half the price of Dockers or other brands, I suppose I'm willing to do a little extra work for them.",6

Pros: DURABLE: The material is tough and hasn't torn after months of use. The stitching has been pretty reliable and hasn't loosened, frayed, or come apart in any areas. RELIABLE: Doesn't shrink in the wash.  Cons: FITMENT: It's incredibly inconsistent from pair to pair. I can't really say that the waist fits ""too small"" or ""too large"" because the sizes of each of the individual pairs of pants are so inconsistent. I bought four pairs of 32W X 32L. Before ever washing them I tried on the four pairs I bought, and they ranged from so tight that they barely closed, all the way to so loose they'd sag without a belt (which is extremely loose for an elastic material). I have never seen this much size inconsistency in any brand of pants. COLOR: For some reason the black dye that Dickies uses for this particular style fades out really quickly. I have been using the same Woolite Darks detergent that I have always used for any of my Dickies pants, but this style has become more gray and faded than pants I've had for years. Not sure why they switched, or if it's because this material just doesn't hold dye as well.",6

Overall, I found them to be a solid choice with a few minor criticisms.  First off, the stretch twill material is comfortable and allows for a great range of motion, which is essential when doing manual labor. The slim taper cut gives a modern look and is flattering on most body types. The pants also have plenty of pockets, including a cell phone pocket, which is a nice touch.  However, there are a few drawbacks to these pants. For one, the sizing is a bit off. I found that the waist ran slightly smaller than other brands, and the length was longer than expected. Additionally, the material tends to attract lint and pet hair, so you'll need to keep a lint roller handy.  Finally, while the pants are advertised as being ""wrinkle resistant,"" I found that they did wrinkle a bit more than other work pants I've worn. It's not a dealbreaker, but it's worth noting.  The Dickies Men's Slim Taper Stretch Twill Work Pant is a solid choice for anyone looking for a modern, comfortable work pant. Just be sure to order a size up and keep a lint roller handy.",9
