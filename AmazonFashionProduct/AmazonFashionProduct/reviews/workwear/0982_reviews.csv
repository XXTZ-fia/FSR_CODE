A bright color, a button-down style, pockets, and low-fuss care!  The fabric is a little heavier than I expected from a chiffon.  I'd definitely call it better suited to Fall than Summer, but that's not a bad thing!  It's not even remotely see-through, and the fabric is heavy enough to drape very nicely.The fit is my favorite!  I almost couldn't believe it when I put it on.  I'm fairly broad shouldered and chesty, and I often find that women's clothes are not proportioned right for people of my build.  But this was perfect.  I'm normally a 12 in button-down shirts.  I ordered this in a large, and it was great.  The sleeves were a little long for me, but I'm short, so they would be if this is going to fit women of more average height.  But what I absolutely loved was the room in the shoulders and the chest.  It's not at all baggy, but skims and flatters my figure with no pinching, gapping, bagging, or other unflattering gestures.It arrived packaged in a nice giftable box, and while it had a few wrinkles, it was nothing a minute or two with the steamer couldn't fix.

It fits great.  I can easily wear this blouse to work but I feel like the two chest pockets also help pull off a casual look.  The fabric is soft but kind of stretchy.  The material is not super heavy, but it is also not see-through either.  I don't have to worry about wearing a tank top under my blouse to avoid showing my bra.  The fabric has a little bit of texture to it that you don't notice unless you look closely.  The sleeve length is perfect.  The cuffs each have a button closure, so it is easy to unbutton and roll your sleeves if you want to.  There is nothing on the inside of the sleeve to secure it though if you do choose to roll them.  Some blouses I own have that feature, so it is easy to wear the sleeves rolled without coming undone.I would not say it is totally wrinkle-free but straight out of the package, it looked good.  I did not need to iron it.  After a full day of wearing it, it also still looks good.For a blouse that only costs only $15, I am thrilled.  This exceeds my expectations.",6

I have no idea what I'm going to wear this with now, or even if I'm going to ever wear it at all, and that's disappointing. So if you're looking for an opaque white button down like I was, I suggest you keep looking.  The highlight is the quality is decent and the fit is great. In terms of fit, it is what I was hoping it would be. I'm normally a size small but sized up to a large to have a more relaxed but not super oversized look. For reference, I'm 5'7"" and 155 lbs with a slim build and 36D chest. So the fit is great, but I would recommend this only if you want a sheer ivory colored button down blouse.",
