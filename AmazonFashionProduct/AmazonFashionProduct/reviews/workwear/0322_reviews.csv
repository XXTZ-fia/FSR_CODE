Unfortunately, Lee appears to have stopped making those and these are the replacement.  Pros: Still very comfortable.  They are sized and stretchy in all the right places so I don't feel like I'm smashing anything and about to rip my pants when standing or sitting.  Cons: The pockets are 40% smaller than on the old pants. Too small to fit my pretty normal sized phone. The leg pocket used to be where my phone lived, but I can't even begin to get the rounded corners into this on. the front pockets I could put my whole hand in and could safely keep my wallet and my phone in a single pocket if I wanted. Now my phone sticks out the top of the pocket it's so shallow and my hand no longer fits in the pocket space. It feels like someone from the women's department got ahold of the design. Lee if you're listening: Fire that person! Women deserve functional pockets too.  The material seems thinner. I'm worried about longevity on these pants.",

Many manufacturers are making their pants into skinny jeans even with big and tall. Lee is no exception to this. However, these pants are a perfect fit. The material is decently thick and the waist fits perfectly. What I absolutely love the most is that these pants are tight in the legs. They fit perfectly and I will definitely be buying more.",2

I've been through a couple different ones and landed on these. I personally haven't owned a pair of Lee's carpenter jeans in decades so was nice to find these.  One thing I noticed from another pair of jeans from Lee's I found was they run a size smaller. Normally I wear size 54 waist but went with 56 waist for these and its perfect fit. Also the inseem is off too as normally I wear 32 but accidentally ordered 30 which was perfect because they fit like 32 in other brands.  These jeans are 100% cotton and thick where it counts too so these should hold up to wear and tear for years. They have a little bit of stretch to them in the waist which was nice too.  I haven't washed them yet to see how they hold up but I don't see them having issues there. It was nice to pull the tags and slip them right on feelinf how much room there is that I can move freely in these soft comfortable jeans.  I went ahead and ordered two more in a darker color so now I'll have four pairs all together. If that doesn't tell ya, I highly recommend these jeans!",
