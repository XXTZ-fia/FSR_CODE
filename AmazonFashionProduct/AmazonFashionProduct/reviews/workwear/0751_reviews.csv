This is definitely a favorite of mine, the material is still light enough to work in comfortably while keeping you safe. I have never been one to wear leathers I'll stick weld in a t shirt when it gets too hot out lol. These shirts are a great medium tough and I have nothing but good experiences after months of use. The size is a little off and I would order a size down next time and that's the only reason for taking a star off. I would almost compare these to the little green jackets everyone always wears with a little flair to them. Even after multiple wash cycles it is still flame resistant and I've even done some overhead welding with this shirt. I seriously have nothing but good things to say about these shirts besides the size and have suggested them to all my friends.
