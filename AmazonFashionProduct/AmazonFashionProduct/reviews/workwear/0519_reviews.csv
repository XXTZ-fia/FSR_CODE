Amazon Customer,This jacket is barely insulated and the sleeves are too long.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHCLK6ZTBMQSU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082N65BKT,"2.0 "," the United States "," January 24, 2025",Size: MediumColor: Charcoal,Verified Purchase,"This jacket is advertised as insulated but the insulation is barely there. Not suitable for temperatures below 50 degrees. Many people mentioned this jackets oversize nature, which would be fine except the sleeves are way to long. I'm 6'1"" 180 lbs and the medium sleeves are at least 2.5 in too long. I'm not sure just who this is sized for.  The overall construction and materials used seem to be of good quality, nut the lack of actual insulation and the orangutan length sleeves earn this 2 stars.",

It was intended for work so I’m not sure if the fit would be as ideal if you didn’t intend to layer as extensively as he does daily… but works for him and what we bought it for. It’s polished/professional looking without being *too* explicitly uniform esque.. actually finishes his top layer with a bit more style that he was lacking with his old coat or any of the other aforementioned layers he wears underneath.. he asked for this specifically and after researching/considering Carhartt options that were more than 2x the price, I’m happy I listened & went with this lol. Would buy again! DEF get the lined version, I can’t imagine the unlined being any more than a denim jacket, possibly even offering less in the warmth dept on that topic.
