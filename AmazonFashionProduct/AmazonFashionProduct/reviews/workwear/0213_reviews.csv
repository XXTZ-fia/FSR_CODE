I'm a heavy around the middle with skinny legs gal and it's hard to find pants of any kind that aren't too baggy in the legs. Too tight in the legs doesn't look good either, so that's the catch. These were entirely comfortable around the middle and waistband is wide with triple rows stitching. There seems to be some extra room in the lap area but that's ok with me as I wear long shirts. The length was a really nice surprise, not too long, not too short. The thigh width was just about right for me. Baggy enough to hide the skinny legs without being sloppy baggy. The material is not stretchy but that is what I wanted. I don't do bending or moving type work. A perfect pair pants for potato on toothpick type bodies! Priced just right.
