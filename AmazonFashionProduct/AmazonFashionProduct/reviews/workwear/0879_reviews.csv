I usually wear a medium, but I have bulked up in size little and the medium doesn't quite fit me anymore so I bought a large. Well, this is large is more like an extra large. The size chart on the description page is not accurate. I hate when clothing companies jump at least 1.5 sizes.  This jacket is also not light weight. This is jacket is thick and more like a winter jacket. I wouldn't wear this when it's freezing but it's too thick for cool fall weather. I'll be returning this.",
Gigoswami,Smart - Good looking jacket,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPYA0ING9JE3H/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B075YSNS1G,"5.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Army Green-n,Verified Purchase,"This was exactly what I was looking for. Not very heavy - can be work like a thick shirt over T shirts as well as Polos. Also manageable over think fabric full sleeve shirts. Fits well - I usually wear XL, but got L as the L was better fit for my shoulders and sleeve length was also good.  Note; This is not a warm jacket. But I suppose you already knew that. It is a jacket which you can layer for style.",
Rick C.,"Cool, casual, coat",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8PNN3J69UW0K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B075YSNS1G,"4.0 "," the United States "," August 2, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Light Grey,Verified Purchase,Great design that gets compliments in the office......just on the slim side for fit,
Nate213,Weird fit for any size,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AR6PUZTMIZI7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B075YSNS1G,"2.0 "," the United States "," August 1, 2024",Size: LargeColor: B-black,Verified Purchase,"First I got the medium. It was a little tight, but looked great. Thought it would loosen up after wearing. Nope. So I bought a large. Not any better. Strange thing is that the same spots, shoulders and wrists, are still tight on the large. The rest is baggy, like it was designed for someone taller and skinnier. I bought the medium because someone left a review saying they were almost exactly the same size as me (5’9”, 160), and it fit great. Idk, maybe they like tight fitting clothes. I work at a grocery store and wore it all the time. I need range of movement for my arms. I need to be able to work without thinking about my jacket all the time. It’s a nice looking one, just beware, the fit may not be for you.",

Side pockets and zippered inside pocket are nice and roomy. Can't say the same for the front two and open inside pockets. Open inside pocket can probably fit a really small notebook and pen. Outside pockets may be more suited to credit cards, USB cables, and wireless earbuds with charger but without outer case.  Otherwise, the jacket feels really nice. I can see wearing this in all seasons except winter, though your mileage may vary in summer based on personal resistance to heat and humidity.",

If I had any cons it would be material feels very breakable so I try and not make crazy movements with the jacket.but all in all it’s a good jacket. Also layer up when you wear it it’s not meant for cold temperatures it just goes right through you.,
lawnboy,Very nice jacket but medium was to tight in arms/shoulder areas,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OOMZ1XQ4753K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B075YSNS1G,"4.0 "," the United States "," October 21, 2023",Size: LargeColor: Coffee,,"I liked everything about this jacket except the medium fit which was a little tight ,especially under arms. If you are taller and thinner in shoulders it might work. I am about 5-9 and 172 lbs. I considered changing for large but sleeves would be too long and body too wide I would guess.",

I have worn this jacket for 3 years. It is a good 3 season jacket that looks good with jeans and a t-shirt or layered with dress shirt and sweater. I get compliments on the styling almost weekly. I like the fit...not too snug, not too big. I have worked in the yard wearing it and still able to come into the office with style. It is surprisingly practical with all the little pockets and zippers. As far as the quality, I waited 3 years before doing a review so that I have a great perspective on the jacket. Nothing has been broken yet. All the stitching has held up.",

It has a nice look and weight.  I particularly like the way it tapers slightly from the shoulder to the waist.  However, it's that feature that could cause problems with sizing.  It you're skinny, it's not a problem.  But if you're carrying a little extra weight, like I am, you'll find it difficult to zip up.  Not impossible, but difficult.  Once it's zipped, it's slightly tight in the midsection, but you can wear it.  I'm planning to lose weight, so I'm keeping the size I ordered (it's basically true to size).  Just keep the weight issue in mind when ordering this sharp-looking jacket!",
DC5,Zipper pull broke twice,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EK9QTMXV5VVM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B075YSNS1G,"1.0 "," the United States "," November 7, 2021",Size: MediumColor: B-black,Verified Purchase,"This was a great jacket — well-fitting, durable feel, and looked great — except for the defective zipper pull. The fifth time I wore it, I was zipping up the jacket, without any strain, and the zipper pull snapped off.  Amazon replaced it with a new jacket. The very first time I wore the new jacket, same thing happened — the zipper pull broke off, again without strain. I’d love to be able to have this jacket work, but there is some kind of design flaw in the zipper pull. Better to try another jacket.",2

The arms were super slim compared to the extra large neck opening. The chest and waist fit just right but it’s a little long. If you’re tall, have skinny arms, and a massive neck... this jacket will fit perfectly. Seems made very well, just oddly shaped with some funny/poorly translated Chinese on the tag.",
