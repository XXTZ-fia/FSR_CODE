Normally I am a “Size 6” in trousers. My weight fluctuates a lot and so do the sizes manufacturers create. Nothing is ever the same! Lol. I personally struggle with finding pants long enough, but if you are tall you will NOT have a problem with these pants no matter what waist size you get. If you are shorter, cuffing and hemming as previous reviews state will be your reality.  I tried 2/26, 4/27 and 6/28. All were perfect in length. I kept the Size 2 and the 6. The Size 2 is what is in the photos.  Size 2: fit perfectly around my hips/waist with no back gap. Perfect amount of hug in my thighs while not being too tight and again, length is just fine. They truly are more like 32-34” in length. All of them. Size 4: started to get that loose waist gap at my back and same with the Size 6. Size 6: I wear them as a more “masculine” fit as they sit lower and right on my hips. Stretch a little bit through the day and become slightly saggier but, whatever. Sometimes I like bigger pants.  Thick + durable material, definitely will cause some swamp ass in hotter weather but will be great for winter. Zipper is a medium rating… Pocket quantity: bangin’. 1-10 stretch is at about a 7.5 4 stars only because I had to order 3 sizes and because I haven’t given them a true go yet at work.",15

Maybe no one at Dickies has seen a woman up close before because the proportions are way off. I bought my usual size and when they came I noticed the inseam was listed at 31”. When I put them on the waist fit fine but the are super long and baggy from the knee down. I measured the seam and it was 31.5”. And now to the worst part the pockets. They are still doing the undersized girl pocket thing. Not a single pocket on these pants can hold a cellphone or wallet. No idea how I’m supposed to work with nowhere to put the phone and take calls. Also the incorrect pocket measurements are what make them tuft out so you can always see the white lining. Someone else mentioned that and unfortunately it’s true you never look put together. I also don’t see how you could get your knee pads in the slots. Mine sure don’t fit. I get the impression these are supposed to be for the work fashion aesthetic and not actual work pants. The only reason I’m keeping these is I don’t have the money for another brand right now.,
