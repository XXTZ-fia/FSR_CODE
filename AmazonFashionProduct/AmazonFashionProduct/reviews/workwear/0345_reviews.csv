The material is much thinner than I expected for a work pant, and they seem to be proportioned like petite clothes, so I'm sure they would be perfect for little working gals, but as advertised disappointing. I don't like the pockets much, except that they included the extra on the left. Overall these have a very trouser-y look in person for those that want a more polished look. I ordered based on measurement and where the pants are supposed to sit and the whole crotch area is just too short, so the waist where it tapers in hits well below mid rise and pinches kinda weird. Because of that I'm extremely skeptical that a 2 will be much better because they proportions would still be off quite a bit length wise. Also not a true 30 inseam. Even if it was they really need to add 0x32 as a size option. But considering the way these are proportioned they are really suited for a petite person, not lanky. 5'7"" w26, h36,",8
