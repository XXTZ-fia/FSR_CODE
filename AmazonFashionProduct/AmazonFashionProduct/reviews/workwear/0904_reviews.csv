Anthony T,Fair quality with fair price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R396QHLYTP3C9F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4UYNHI,"3.0 "," the United States "," December 20, 2024",Size: 32W x 30LColor: Khaki,Verified Purchase,"Size and colour are same as described. The weight of the pants are light and material is soft.  But the problem is the waistband used by Red Kap is kinda bad nylon like material.. Sewing has sharpe edges which hurt my tummy when I move around. I don’t mind if they increase the price a bit to replace with cotton. C/P value is still very competitive for a daily workwear though.  Overall, it has construction for the lining and the outsourcing work quality are disappointing. I miss the superior quality Red Cap during WWII.",

I'm just not set up for sewing at this time in my life or it might be an easy repair.  And the fabric has to be ironed if they are to look a nice as other slacks that are non-iron. My husband has only worn them twice, the first time, touched up with an iron, and the second time they needed a full ironing job to look nice. I've never bought Red Kap before, I usually get dressier slacks. I won't get these again. I'm sure there is lots of wear left, if I wanted to mend and iron.",

What is a bit strange is it just feels like the tailoring/construction is a bit off. The seams don't appear straight everywhere, the zipper does not want to move very well.  I don't know if I'd buy them again. Again, color and fit are fine (for me), and I don't think they are going to fall apart soon, but it's like they were sewn by student tailors or something.",2
