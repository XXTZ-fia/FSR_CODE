Otherwise, the fabric quality is excellent, and I like the weight of the it....unlike some reviewers who say it is thin.

I encourage prospective buyers to pay especially close attention to the size chart. I suggest that if you are very, very close to the next larger size, order the larger size. Here is why:  I was very close to the line between medium and large. I ordered the medium size. When the garment arrived I immediately tried it on (without a shirt under it). I noticed when I took it off it was a little hard to remove, but It didn’t raise any particular concern.  The next day I put it back on, this time with a T-shirt underneath. At the end of the day when it was time to undress for bed,I discovered that it was virtually impossible to extricate my self from the garment (due to the extra bulk of the T-shirt). After more than 45 minutes of unsuccessful struggle, I made  the difficult decision to resort to scissors (I had no one living with me who could have helped me).Despite all this I was impressed enough with the quality of the garment that I have ordered another in the larger size.",
