The Large had enough room for my slight dad belly.,4

Lov2u2,Very nice shirt super light weight material,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3H5MFT47EKL0W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWGQRJLB,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 13, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Khaki,,"This shirt is very nice. I got it for my husband for when we go fishing and hiking. I love that it has so many pockets especially the one with the zipper so he can definitely keep his phone or car keys secure. We lost our keys once when he had them in his pants pocket and they fell out when he pulled his phone out of his pocket. The material is very light weight, my husband really likes to wear it when it is so hot here because it wicks the moisture off of your skin a bit so you are not dripping with sweat. I also like the solid neutral color, I don’t have to worry about him clashing colors or patterns!",

Reaves,Lightweight and breathable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CQXTKCX7H92Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWGQRJLB,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 11, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Light Grey,,"I recently received this men's short-sleeve UPF 50+ sun protection button-down fishing shirt, and I'm impressed! This shirt is perfect for a day out on the water. Here's a breakdown of the key features:  Sun Protection: With a UPF rating of 50+, this shirt blocks out nearly all of the sun's harmful UV rays. This is essential for preventing sunburn and long-term skin damage, especially important for long days spent outdoors.  Comfort: The shirt is made from a thin, lightweight material that is very comfortable to wear. It breathes well and wicks away moisture, so you'll stay cool and dry even on hot, humid days.  Button-Down Design: The button-down design is a nice touch. It gives the shirt a more polished look than a traditional fishing tee, while still being functional. You can wear it untucked for a relaxed feel, or tuck it in for a more formal look.  Fishing-Friendly Features: This shirt has a built-in chamois to clean your sunglasses, and multiple pockets for storing gear.  Overall, I'm very happy with this fishing shirt. It's comfortable, protective, and stylish. It's a great option for any angler who wants to stay cool and protected on the water.",2

I love the details put into the construction of this shirt. From the glass cleaner, fishing rod holder, and easy access pocket at the chest. This shirt is very breathable and comfortable to wear which also means it is loose fitting. So if you want a more fitting shirt maybe go a size smaller.",

The fit is spot accurate, and the breathable fabric has tiny holes that adds a unique touch. It looks sharp. The pockets are nice, and one is extra large and zippered -- perfect for keeping my cell phone. The only downside is the shirt’s a bit on the thin side. I'd prefer it a tad heavier for a bit more comfort.",
Marilyn T.,Comfortable,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R351D483LOG3GB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWGQRJLB,"4.0 "," the United States "," April 5, 2024",Size: MediumColor: Army Green,,A super lightweight fabric that breathes great! Multiple pockets with stay-close velcro or zipper. A small cloth on the inside of the front placket to clean your glasses. I was a little disappointed in that the wrinkles did not come out when washed and I had to iron it. Synthetics usually come out pretty good when laundered. otherwise a great shirt. Sized correctly-not slim cut.,

This is a great option without having to do free advertising.  At 6 foot and 200 lb., the XL fits loose and comfortably. I like the ventilation, this dries quickly, and its easy to pack for summer travel. I like this so much I'm back to buy more.",
Mr. Smith,Great for travel with nearly hidden zippered pocket,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCHSVJS65AVOF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWGQRJLB,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 27, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Navy,,"I got the navy blue XL size shirt and it really looks navy blue, something is wrong with the color of my photo. The shirt is pretty true to size and is 100% polyester with pinprick holes intentionally in the fabric to breathe, my photo shows the holes below the collar on the yellowish place mat.  Before I wore it, I washed it and hung it to dry, it was practically dry just coming out of the washer.  I have another famous make of a fishing shirt, I like lightweight quick drying shirts for hot places when traveling that pack small.  This shirt has a nearly hidden zipper pocket behind the chest pocket, great to stash some cash when a tourist. I'll take off the string to make it harder to pull down the zipper.  This shirt does not have a second panel on the back, it's made in similar style to ordinary shirts. The description photos show the possible use of the various pockets accurately, the pen spots are really openings in the front pockets, so if you lift the flap the pen body is right there, it's not a separate tube of material for the pen pocket.",3
Dr. T,Almost perfect!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3S9NNUJ2RH7ES/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CWGQRJLB,"4.0 "," the United States "," March 26, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Army Green,,"I like how lightweight and breezy this shirt feels. Fit and finish are top notch; it's very comfortable to wear. I wouldn't necessarily call the fabric ""mesh"" but it has little tiny holes spaced about 1/8 inch apart, everywhere. It looks great, and the pockets are insane, especially the HUGE zipper pocket on the left front. I like the zipper closure, because it keeps my cell phone from falling out on the ground when I lean over.  The only thing I don't like so much about this shirt is the fabric tends to hold a static charge. This is kind of distracting, feeling the hair on my arms stand up all the time. I will see if that changes after a few passes through the laundry.  As 100% polyester shirts go, this one is better than most. I generally prefer cotton but this is acceptable. I would probably order again.",

Liked the zippers on the pockets and loved that the pockets were big. I love that it looks good on him. He said it was comfortable. I asked if he wanted me to ordered another one in a different colour and he actually said yes! So he will have two nice looking and comfortable shirts for our Cuba Trip next month. Oh and I know what he’s getting for his birthday. The colours are very nice as well. The fit is true to size.,
