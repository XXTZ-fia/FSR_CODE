I like the coat. It runs a little large. I typically take a large and a medium in this fits good with a little room for layers. I returned one and dropped it off at Amazon at Whole Foods on Dec 31 and didn’t get a refund until Jan 18. It took nearly 3 weeks to get my refund (after looking that’s this sellers policy, not because it was slow). Longer than any other retailer and any other item I have purchased from Amazon. So if you’re unsure I would suggest finding a different seller on Amazon or purchase in a store.",

I’ve been in the natural gas construction industry for the last 6 years as an inspector, I’ve been in construction my entire working life and worn Carhart everyday.  From pants to tee shirts, socks, hats, beanies and jackets. I even owned an insulated vest. If you want gear that will last the test of time and hard work, Carhart will never let you down.  I’ve retired a good amount of all Carhart gear.  This jacket I bought because I like nice things and like to look professional in my inspection duties of the job sites.  Living and working in Northern Nevada near Lake Tahoe we’re on layoff for winter due to the high level of snow we get every year so a lot of us plow snow in the winter to stay busy.  This  jacket will be perfect with a hoodie under it, bought it 1 size to big on purpose just for that reason.  I used a can of water proofing on it to help keep me dry. One cool option on this jacket is it has snaps around the collar to add the canvas hood if I wanted to. The stitching is heavy duty and has plenty of pockets to keep what I need to carry safe. It has a pocket on the inside that has a zipper, just big enough for a sub compact conceal carry pew pew.  A valid expectation is this jacket lasting the next 10 years.  Well worth the money spent",14

You can wear a good bit of layers and still feel free. Great for winters. Although it isn’t very flexible.  I’m a larger man so xxl is pretty good for me with hoodies. With the jacket, it feels like a 3XL due to the amount of space. I personally enjoy it so I can wear layers underneath and take off the jacket if need be.  It definitely kept me warm and yet it feels breathable because you can adjust the bottom of the jacket to be tight or loose.  Flexibility is one thing, I haven’t had much time to break it in. Only had about two months of wear so far and the material is pretty stiff. So trying to work under a car or in tight spaces with the sleeve down makes it a bit challenging. Inside the sleeves is an elastic cuff so you can roll up the sleeve for a bit more room but it’s a heavier jacket and fall down occasionally.",5
