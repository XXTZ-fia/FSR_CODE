Beautiful color and well stitched. it has a slight stretch which is nice. Unfortunately it is way too small. Im a 36D and it doesnt button up. Even the sleeves are a lil tight. I would recommend sizing up as it's a great top if you can get into it.,

Caffeinated ESTP,Beautiful button down blouse. Fitted in all the right places.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1B5AEYBB1NV66/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK1LVDNR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2025",Color: Wine RedSize: XX-Large,,I love a good button down shirt. This one is perfect! I love the deep red color. The buttons match the shirt and are covered by a flap of material. Gives the shirt a seamless appearance. I always order an XX-Large when shopping online. This shirt fits me very well. It is fitted in all the right places. It accentuates my curves without drawing attention to my stomach region. It's a really great blouse! The fabric is 100% polyester. Machine wash and hang to dry. Made in China.,
Jason C.,Nice shirt with some minor sewing defects,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12GF2RTC27K2O/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK1LVDNR,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Color: Light BlueSize: Small,,"This shirt is surprisingly nice for the price point. The only thing keeping it from five stars is quite a few loose threads around the buttonholes that cause buttons to get snagged and stuck. Not a huge deal, and can be fixed, but if the stitching was a little better this would be a five-star buy",
SHERYLON ROBERTS,fabric is not what I expected for polyester,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BD38KILZ65SQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK1LVDNR,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 14, 2025",Color: Light GreenSize: Large,Verified Purchase,It was to small and the fabric was not anywhere close to what I expected.,
Karla,Super flattering look!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36YQHX51YWQZX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK1LVDNR,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 13, 2025",Color: PinkSize: Medium,,"This blouse will definitely be a staple for any wardrobe - it can be layered, it can be dressed up or down and I can see it working with multiple outfits, whether casual or business casual. It hugs the waistline and gives a very flattering look.  I like that it has a ""flap"" that covers the buttons, so there will be no buttons snagging any necklaces or scarves. It can also be machine washed, and if hung right after the drying cycle is finished, it won't get very noticeable wrinkles. The size chart is accurate - very - and there is no wiggle room; so if you don't like a fitted look, I would order one size up. The only thing that I did not like about this blouse is the size of the buttonholes; it feel like I was wrestling with each button because the hole was just too small. The price is reasonable, I will probably order a couple more blouses in different colors.",
RS2,"Comfortable blouse, loose fit",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23XCN0UVYP9FO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK1LVDNR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 11, 2025",Color: A-blackSize: Large,,"I got this for my wife and she loves it. The attention to detail is right on point - the blouse is flawless. The fabric is medium- light so it's suitable for warmer weather wear . The color is a rich black - very much as depicted in the seller's picture. Very nice. With regard to fit: My wife has a 44"" bust so the L leaves her almost one inch on each side. The rest of the blouse fits her loosely. That works for her because she does like her blouses to fit loose and this was a great fit for her. My suggestion is to read the size chart provided by the seller and don't do downsizing, unless you want a tighter fit. You won't be disappointed with the quality. This is a nice blouse. She is very happy with this item.",
Larry,Form fitting AND comfortable?....Leggo my arm.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XYX7Y6QXKPL9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK1LVDNR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Color: Light BlueSize: Small,,"Trying to look sharp, refined and sleek without seeming pretentious? You might get there with this blouse. The form fitting shape screams casual sophistication(oxymoron much?). If you like a more snug fit, no worries - there's enough stretch in the fabric to accommodate and still be comfortable. Fabric has a crisp feel and still manages to feel great. Blouse has survived the first couple of washes without incident and most importantly, without an iron in sight. Fits as expected relative to stated size(S). At $20 this is a no brainer.",
Benji and I . . .,Flattering fit,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EX919U4XLFQS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK1LVDNR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Color: PinkSize: Medium,,"This shirt allows me to be flirty and professional, with a taper that highlights my natural curves and a flattering fit around the bust area. The pink color is pale and tepid, which is a refreshing take on the color. This shirt strikes the right balance between casual and professional, making it a great choice for daily office wear. Highly recommended.",
Christie Katona,Love the fitted look of this shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SUYWRY0ZY7EI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK1LVDNR,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 6, 2025",Color: KhakiSize: Small,,"I ordered this for my daughter who is just starting a new job where she will be required to wear dressier clothes and even some suits.  She immediately loved the fitted nature of this blouse and also the soft feel of the material.  She also commented on the sleeve length, as they came to a nice level on her arms (not too short).  She also loved the opaqueness of the material as she tried it on with a black bra and it did not show through.  Overall, this is going to be a great staple in her closet for under blazers or even as a more casual shirt with jeans.  It is so versatile, it can be dressed up or down depending on your needs.

VEW,Beautiful Blouse,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DI9SKQLZT7AO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK1LVDNR,"5.0 "," the United States "," December 25, 2024",Color: KhakiSize: Small,,"This is a lovely blouse for a very reasonable price.  The fabric is a heavy-weight polyester that has a very slight sheen and a little stretch to it.  The fitted cut is very elegant and because of the design, there is a lot of top stitching, which is very neatly done and makes the blouse look much more expensive than it is.  The front placket, which covers the buttons, adds to the quality look.  The care instructions are to machine wash in cold water, but hang dry.  I bought the khaki color, but will be adding more colors to my wardrobe.",
