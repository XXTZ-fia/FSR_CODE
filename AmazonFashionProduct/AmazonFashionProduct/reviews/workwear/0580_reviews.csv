Fabric alone isn't the most disappointing part of these pants. They are huge. I wear an extra small long regularly, well I sized up because they were already snug in my butt and I have gained weight since being pregnant . These have so much room in the upper butt and crotch. I don't know why that area would be disproportionately large. The stretchy stomach is too big right now, but I can see that being ok, however the design isn't smooth and it looks like I'm wearing a bag under my shirt. I want to go back to my regular size, but apparently we can't be an extra small and tall at the same time. Very disappointed. I would not recommend these.",

Comfortable and not too tight with a small amount of stretch.  Waistband/ belly band is soft.Cons:  waistband/ belly band is not stretchy all around, just has an elastic band at the very top to hold them up.  At 21 weeks I would expect them to fit but they kept sliding down.  The belly band is just a large piece of fabric.  Maybe I will buy them again once I am further along but at this point they kept sliding down so I returned them.",

I had to go down to a medium. Also the petite/short size is a little on the short side. They are ok while standing but when sit run up way to high. Might recommend getting their standard size if you are taller than 5’3.  Otherwise the are comfortable. I’m 5’3 and at 32 weeks into my pregnancy am ~157 lbs.,

Very comfortable and I haven't had any issues with them falling down. Love that I can get long length.,
