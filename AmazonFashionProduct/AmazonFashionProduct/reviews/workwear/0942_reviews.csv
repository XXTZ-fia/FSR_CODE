matt morson,"Too much FABRIC, runs a size large",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OE8LW7N5R8EA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS6FBRXW,"2.0 "," the United States "," April 30, 2024",Size: LargeColor: Gray,Verified Purchase,"I have posted photos of the excess fabric I feel this shirt has. I feel this shirt may run a size large. It seems big every where. When I lift my arms and drop them there is a buldge of fabric in the front breast and back area. If your working it will not be noticeable to who is wearing it but to others looking at you. If feels like a waste high dress. I have a medium tummy buldge after having kids but this shirt gives me a maternity feel. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT for a woman in the maternity stage as you have that mid growth room and will not feel restricted in the tummy. As for others looking for a stylish change in uniform... 🤔 Be on the cautious side of this shirt. I RECOMMEND getting a size smaller than your usual size and it is probly a sytle best suited for someone who has a flatter figure and not much belly chub as it just makes you look more chubby. I am going to return this for a smaller size to see what changes. I ORDERED a Large. As my usual shirt size is a large. I have to be cautious of shirts beung too small and tight in the breast area. my breasts are a 38D, Im 5'7"" at 162 lbs. Hope this gives a better overall idea of a body size to picture with the Large shirt.",7

Pretty but way to big.i ordered a size medium.im 5'5 and about 140lbs.i think a small would fit better but it's so large an xs may have fit perfectly.
