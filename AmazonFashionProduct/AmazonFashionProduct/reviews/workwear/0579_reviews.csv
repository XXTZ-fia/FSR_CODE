Please make cloths with suitable pockets that will accomodate a phone.  We all carry our phones with us and need to have a safe handy place to store them.  The back pocket of jeans is not that place.  You don't want to sit on your phone nor is it a safe place.  It can fall out or be taken easily.  Come up with a better idea!  This not only applies to jeans but also jackets.  Create custom pockets for phones, please.  I recently purhased a very nice hoodie jacket but there is no accomodation for a phone and the pockets are useless for any item--case in point.Now in regards to thes pants and I purchased two of them in different colors.  They have very good pockets and the two large front ones work great for carrying a phone.  The pants are light, fit well for me  with a 37 waist and the length is just right, about 30/31.
