jpizano,Most durable pants I’ve owned!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RT8WI290M45IQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07MZKFJFZ,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 23, 2025",Size: 44W x 32LColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I now own 7 pairs of these and I’m ordering more. Great duty and daily wear. These pants are a great fit around the waist, and I have never had a single issue with the pockets or them shrinking. The inside button doesn’t have to be reinforced every so often, but I fell on the concrete with these and slide about 6 feet at a full sprint. I broke my arm, but these pants came away with two small tears. One on the  knee and one on the upper thigh. They are so small, they aren’t really noticeable. Didn’t break through the material and saved my leg. I wear these daily and I highly recommend them to everyone!!!",

I own several colors of tactical, multi pocketed ones in different colors and they're my daily wear. The pockets are roomy enough for cell phones and wallets and the fabric stretches ever so slightly. The waistband expands a couple of inches which is a good thing especially after a superlative buffet lunch. They are a bit pricey but with proper care will last for years. My tundra green is 15 years old and shows no sign of wear just a slight fading of the color. But that's to be expected. I will settle for nothing less than 5.11 for any occasion.",

DocHolliday,Incredibly Frustrated and Disappointed with 5.11,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NOJ03Q056MA9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07MZKFJFZ,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 5, 2024",Size: 32W x 30LColor: Ranger Green,,"I am incredibly frustrated and disappointed with 5.11. They have almost certainly lost a professional customer.  I ordered a pair of Stryke pants, in Ranger Green, to use as part of my Law Enforcement duty uniform. This order was purchased during 5.11’s law enforcement appreciation event. However, the Stryke pants I received are too short. They were about 1.5-2"" shorter than every other Stryke pants I own (in the same size). I have about 15 pair of Stryke pants, and it seems that every 4-5 pair I get one that is unusually short. It is ridiculous that their QC is that bad, or their products have that much variance. However, due to that, I typically purchase 5.11 pants at my local 5.11 store so I can find the correct length, but none of the stores ever have the Stryke pants in Ranger Green in stock.  I contacted 5.11’s customer service regarding the issue. I was sent a link to return the pants, instructed to select fitment issue, and in the notes write that I needed to exchange the pants, and the size that I wanted. I did that, and sent the pants back. I even included the same note with the pants, to ensure there was not any misunderstanding. When 5.11 received the pants, they processed them as a return, and refunded my money. I never asked for a refund, I need the pants for a duty uniform, and only needed a different size.  Again, I contacted 5.11’s customer service, who has been completed unhelpful. I have been informed that there is nothing 5.11 is willing to do to properly resolve the issue. I was told that I would just need to repurchase the pants. I was provided a discount code to use, but the code would still result in the pants costing more than the original price I paid, and I would have to pay shipping again. Customer service has also refused to escalate the issue to anyone at a higher level that may be able to resolve the issue, after asking them to do so.  Expecting me to pay more for the item + shipping, for their mistake, is just ridiculous. Especially for pants that were clearly defective to begin with.  All I expected was for 5.11 for send me the correct size pants. I will be sure to share this level of service with my 6000 person agency, including our uniform supply manager who recently began ordering V.XI gear (which is terrible by the way) for my unit and several others. The Crye Precision gear is looking much more appealing now, as they have always had outstanding customer service. I guarantee an issue like this would not occur with them.  If this is the level of customer service we can now expect from 5.11, I will transition to one of their competitors for my uniform and gear needs.",

This is obvious when matched up with pants that are 34W/32L ordered years ago. And do not match the second pants color charcol that are actually 36W/32L. - Pants received were obviously used /pre-worn. - Pants felt unusually soft. As if removed from the dryer. Not the slightly stiffness of actual new pants. This was noticed immediately when removed from bag. - The pants smelled of laundry detergent. And not the typical light industrial type smell of new pants - The small black size tag on the back of the inner waist band was removed. The evidence of material can still be seen in the stitching. - The inner pants white wash instruction label is rolled as it would be when worn for a period of time. I physically received the pants today. Since the pants could not be delivered to me directly. So I had them sent to my US address where my sister can then have it shipped to my current location overseas. I am currently assigned overseas. Traveling performing Quality inspections and audits to aeroapace factories. I am extremely upset because I paid $82.00 for pre-worn/ used pants that are wrong size. Thank you so much. As a quality inspector. It is obvious that quality does not matter at the makers of 5.11 pants and Amazon.,

That said, I do think it is a little silly to have such small thighs on these pants. People with a 36' inseam are going to have large thighs because they are tall. I'm 6'7 and sitting down in these pants can be awkward.

This time, I figured on taking an errand out of the drive time and just ordering from AMZ. Unusually, the set I ordered from AMZ was an inch too long. If you check the photos, the black Strykes are 36x30. I bought these at the 5.11 store. The stone colored ones are also tagged as 36x30 and were purchased through AMZ. But placed side by side, the stone colored ones are an inch longer. The fit at the waist line and thigh are correct and (subjectively) the same as the black Strykes. Sort of strange.  I would have sent them back but didn't check the length until after I'd taken the tags off. My bad. Make sure to check the length against existing (same style) 5.11 pants if you have them.",
