I had gone through buying 4 different pairs to find a fit, but 1 of them were from a different brand. One thing I will start off with is that dickies does not offer anything below the length of 30. It's disappointing because apparently 29 is the perfect length for me.  My review is a must because I know I had a hard time finding my size so anyone similar will struggle. I'm a male standing at 5'3 weighing in at 165lbs. This means that I'm very short with some width (more of a muscular shape). Important to note because some pants seem too slim and too wide while not being long enough.  The regular fit and relaxed straight are both toooo baggy at the bottom. Idk how anyone finds comfort in those bell bottom of a pant. The waist was a bit tight but still very comfortable. I bought these slim fit at 32W x 30L and they are almost perfect. They are a bit baggy but doesn't look too bad and lil tight so I may try the 34W but I feel like a 33W would have hit the nail. Once again, none available at that size.  If you are looking for a uniform look, these are absolutely perfect. The slim pants provide professional uniform look, the pockets are functional and it comes with a crease down the front legs as well. Very durable as described with moisture wicking and etc. The material is great, and comfortable. The only other downside is the waist doesn't have any give. Which has me a bit concerned if I ever need to tuck in my work shirt. Might be the universe telling me to hit the gym lol  an idea for dickies would be to add some elastic material to the waist that will allow stretch for tucking shirts. In the winter I'd normally tuck in a warm under layered shirt, a tee, and then my uniform shirt.",2

Most of my pants have five loops, so I appreciate the seven, especially when I bend down a bit.  I was hoping that the material would be a bit thicker as they are not exactly the warmest garment I own (cheap jeans are much thicker and warmer).  One other thing is the positioning of the pockets.  The cargo pockets on the legs are positioned so that something like a car key fob will bounce against the lower leg,  even below the knee area.
