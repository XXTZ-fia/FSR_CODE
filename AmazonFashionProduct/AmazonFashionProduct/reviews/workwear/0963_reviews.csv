Mrs.TurDUCKen,Great product! Sizing is weird for petites.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WX3PMKTB1MWB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CKJHSRT9,"3.0 "," the United States "," March 2, 2019",Size: 3X-LargeColor: Galaxy Blue,Verified Purchase,"The product itself is great. It is high quality, heavy drape scrubs, with no stretch. They will last a long time on the floor, and put up with numerous washes. I am 5’1” and currently 200lbs. After reading reviews about sizing, I was concerned about sticking with my normal 2X, so I went for 3X. I don’t know if there is a size I could order in this particular scrub top that would fit me right because it is so dad-blasted LONG! I’d feel like I was wearing the world’s boxiest prom dress to work every shift. Also, I’ve read previous reviews claiming that the Cherokee scrub tops from different lines don’t always match pants from other Cherokee lines, and it was true in this case. I bought “Galaxy Blue” in this scrub top and the same “galaxy blue” in pants from a different Cherokee line, and the shades don’t match... At all. You know when your S.O. tries to wear a neon green shirt with a pair of hunter green pants, and looks at you all stupid when you don’t want be seen with them and then they whine, “But it’s the same color! Doesn’t it MATCH?” Yeah. That’s how well the shades match. No biggie though. Just buy neutral bottoms and fun colored tops, or vice versa! Don’t try to match!",

I brought these because my current scrubs are starting to pill in my perineum area as the fabric in that area is constantly rubbing against each other. I brought two pairs of these scrubs with the matching pants and I was not satisfied. The pants have a more fit feel compared to my WW flex and much less stretch compared to my WW flex. I have an athletic build and I need a good amount of thigh room and so forth. The scrub top itself is much longer and baggier than my WW flex. As my mentor would say, Cherokee get your sh** together and stop changing sizes we all already love.",

It's pretty important for me to have comfortable arm movement in scrubs. There is no stretch even though it says it on the sleeve. Don't care too much about how they look (baggy in the wrong places), but functional fit and comfort is important and these just don't have it. They constrict my shoulder flexion and droop too much when I put things in the pockets and lean over at all. If you're a lean, athletic person and have a smaller waist than shoulder circumference don't get theses, there are better options. Just OK because of the pockets. Don't fit like the picture.",
