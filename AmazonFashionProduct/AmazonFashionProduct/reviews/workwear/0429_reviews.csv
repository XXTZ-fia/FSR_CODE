The only crappy thing is that Amazon is taking an entire month to process a refund even though I returned it the same day it arrived. I am very upset about this as I need these shorts for work. If Amazon would just give the refund sooner then I wouldn’t be as upset, as I would have been able to get the correct size much sooner.

I took a gamble and ordered a pair of their pants. I loved how they fit, I loved how they flexed, great pocket layout, and they seemed to hold up. I was happy with my purchase.  Fast forward to summer and warm weather. Obviously I'm gonna order a pair of these shorts because I was happy with the pants.  Well...they almost made it a month before getting ripped. I was under a deck and slid my butt over a rock and ripped a good sized hole in the shorts....truthfully the rock wasn't even sharp. If I had on my carhartts, or my duluth shorts, it never would have been an issue.  That being said, would I order these shorts, or even the pants, again? Ehh, maybe. As everyday wear. Like I said before, I do like a lot of things about them. Would I use them for work? Absolutely not, unless I'm inside doing inside finish work or pricing out jobs.  These pants/shorts are expensive, and I would spend the money if they were going to last, but the durability just isn't there. $80 down the drain.  I will also mention the front of the shorts have started pilling up too. Another sign of the fabric not holding up well.",2

Rene Wolk,comparing to Carrhart shorts,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRLADKB9YRMTQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08JNC45LB,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 18, 2023",Size: 36W x 9LColor: Deep Grey,Verified Purchase,"I'm a postal carrier but it takes about 6 months before uniform cards are issued.  With some hot weather approaching, I ordered a pair of these and the Carrhart rugged flex shorts.  These are more than double the price; almost 3 times.  Many of the comments say they run small.  They fit me perfect, but I would say if you have any kind of a belly, go 1 size up.  (Constant walking has caused my belly to disappear).Both have pen pockets, but I like the ones on this better.  I need to carry a marker, a pen, and some kind of knife every day.  The main expense is likely the fabric.  This uses technical fabric which is more lightweight and dries more quickly if it gets wet.  I started the day thinking while it was more comfortable, I would have to consider the price difference.  By the end of walking 6 hours on an 80 degree day, the fabric and price difference was worth it to me.  If you're not going to use them quite that hard, the Carrharts are a good, less expensive alternative.  But for me and how I use, worth the premium.",12

Also not made in the USA. Maybe a little less expensive than Kuhl but so far seem just as good. These are my new go to shorts and pants brand.  I also ordered a pair of T2 pants at the same time as these shorts. I was a little disappointed that the waste sizes were not the same fit between the shorts and the pants. The shorts fit like they should have but the pants were a little bigger.  I am 5' 9"" tall 160lbs. The 34"" waist and 11"" length are perfect. A 33 would be ideal but they are great. They sit just at my knees.  As for the noise. Yes they are swooshy. Anyone who wears outdoor technical clothing will be familiar with the noise. It is just the nature of the water repellent fabric.  The pockets are great. I carry my wallet in the leg pocket of all my pants. I do wish the zippered pocket on these had the zipper in the top or the back. Its location on the front is a little awkward for me but that just me and how I sue my pants pockets. It is still very functional. I would also prefer a zipper on the left pocket instead of the velcro. Again, this is just a personal preference.  My other 2 issues are having 2 buttons for closure. Seems over kill but it wouldn't keep me from buying or suggesting them to anyone else. The last issue is the zipper. It could be about an inch longer I think. It is a little short for my liking.  Like everything else, time will tell how long they will last. My TAD Gear lasted me more than a decade. And I wouldnt have replaced them or the shorts if I hadnt lost so much weight.",6

Don’t clothing companies test products before they are put on the market? This is a huge defect in an otherwise nice pair of shorts! I don’t know what “work” shorts are supposed to be, but I was surprised at how light and thin the material is, not a heavy duck canvas at all which I had expected for “working” in. Too early for me to say how well they will hold up over time, or how resistant to tears or stains. Even though they are supposed to be an 11 inch inseam, I would have liked a longer inseam, maybe 12 or 13 inches since these come well above my knees. I would also have liked a longer zipper, which I would have expected at this high price point for a pair of shorts. I measured the zipper as four inches and then measured other pants I own and found that most pant zippers are six inches. The loss of two inches of zipper makes these shorts seem cheap and poorly made and awkward to wear. Maybe the company found they could save 25 cents this way, but I’m subtracting four stars for these cheaply made shorts.",4
