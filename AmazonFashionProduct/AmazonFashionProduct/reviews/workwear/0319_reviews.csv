I didn't pay attention to it being a HHworkwear jacket.  You could wear it for skiing, but it much stiffer than most ski jackets.  I really want to keep this jacket, but I'll have to return it.  I'm 5'8"", 280 lbs, 40 waist, 54"" chest, 20"" neck, 34/35 shirt sleeve length.  I carry my weight in the stomach.  I wear 3XL T-shirts.  I went to Skier's Outlet and tried a bunch of jackets on.  I squeezed into a 2XL Spyder ski jacket and purchased.  This HH jacket looks great.  I'd definitely wear it as an everyday jacket.  It feels super durable.  It would take some effort to rip the outer shell.  It feels like a weather proof canvas bag or firehose.  It has a little stiffness to it.  I got warm pretty quick in the house trying it on.  The hood has to go though.  It is rolled into a collar pocket and creates an uncomfortable/annoying stiff collar.  Most of the jacket was a bit loose.  The sleeves were too long for me.  It has Velcro at the wrists for tightening.  The back of the jacket went below the belt line by a few inches.  The front of the jacket was just below my belly button.  Not sure why a 3XL wouldn't compensate for the reason a person wears a 3XL.  It has a cord around the bottom for tightening it around the waist.  If had fit over the belly, I might have still returned it to get a 2XL.",

Particularly like that it hits around the hips in the front but dips lower in the back to keep the elements from going down your pants when you bend over.

Io l'ho presa per escursioni e lavoro in autunno/inverno ed è un prodotto valido. Ha quattro tasche frontali tutte con cerniera e una tasca interna senza chiusura. Ha elementi riflettenti, anche sulla schiena e, particolare interessante, la spalla è cucita in un unico pezzo per evitare strappi. Interessante la cerniera posta internamente nella parte posteriore che permette una ispezione della fodera e per areare il giaccone in caso di pioggia o neve. Ha un cappuccio regolabile che si nasconde nel colletto ma che si può anche asportare. Il colletto, con chiusura alta e avvolgente, è foderato di pile. Altro particolare, il lato posteriore del giaccone è leggermente più lungo per proteggere anche quando si sta in posizione abbassata sulle gambe o ci si inchina in avanti, mentre il lato frontale arriva poco più giù della vita. La seconda spedizione è stata perfetta e il giaccone HH è stato consegnato ben protetto, con etichette applicate e protezioni di carta. Molto consigliato.",

Hopefully not all needlework is this bad on this jacket otherwise it will fall apart before the winter and before I have a chance to wear it.  It's not just a problem with this jacket, many things bought on Amazon lately have similar problems. I bought a cargo shorts just before the summer and I already had to mend them 3 times. The thread broke in all cases. Similar problem with a pillow I bought, thread broke the first day. I don't know why companies try to save a cent or two by using a thread which disintegrates if you look at it the wrong way (no force needs to be applied). When I pick a thread, and this is mostly when I have to fix stuff I bought on Amazon, I always pull the thread apart with my fingers and pick one which looks like it would cut my finger off before breaking.

I bought one in red a couple of years back, and it served me very well indeed.  The only reason I retired it, is because I always wanted a black one - and this one came along at the right price.  The jacket is extremely warm - plenty warm enough for a UK winter.  It's also not ""thin"" and not easily ripped like a lot of more expensive ""designer"" coats (you know which one's I mean!).  I wear this in heavily wooded areas when I'm out walking with my dogs, and I know this won't snag (my last one never did) on every protruding branch.  Glad I got it at the amazing price I paid!",
