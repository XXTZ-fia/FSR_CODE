If your are 6’ or below MAKE SURE YOU GET the SHORT model. The regular model is longgg I mean like 6’5 long.  These do fit kind of strange especially if you have larger or muscular thighs you’ll notice that the size you need will fit perfect but be a bit loose around the waist.  BUT there are drawstrings so you can tighten and make them snug. Is this ideal? No, but it’s the only way I’ve learned with these as I know multiple people who have them. It seems a little stiff material wise at first but give it a couple washes and these will be so soft it’s crazy. They aren’t very stretchy at all. The ripstop quality is really nice and strong preventing normal rips that would occur. Honestly yes these are made for nurses but these are great for just hot weather environments too. I even got my grandfather a pair.",

I ordered these pants twice.  After the second order, several months apart, I come to realize I will not order these again.  The fit is strange!  The length is great, the waist is too big. Using the drawstring to hold up the pants doesn’t work well. Especially if you put anything of moderate weight in your pockets. The pants will slide off your waist and you will spend a considerable amount of time pulling them back up in place.  If you use a belt with the belt loops, in addition to the pull strings, the front button will come undone leaving you with a pouch of unbuttoned pants, untucked shirt, and a belt buckle pushed against your skin.  Squatting down in these pants for anyone that has decent muscle tone in your thighs is not that great.  Forget about putting a cell phone in your front pocket and trying to squat down. The pockets are so short and tight, the phone in your pocket will prevent you from squatting.The color after several washes did not fade, the style with cargo pockets is a must for me working in the medical field, and the thickness of the material is definitely great quality.  All in all, I after several wears, i consistently feel like I am being packed up for shipping due to the tighter fit of this brand",4

I like that I can order a LARGE SHORT, since I have a short inseam, it falls close to my inseam. (Versus just ordering Large, which then are too long and I need to hem them or pay to hem them.) So, that is a huge plus for me that I appreciate. Plenty of pockets. Yes, a zipper pocket somewhere would be nice, but for me, not a deal breaker either. I have purchased Carhart Ripstop exclusively since 2014, when I came across them at a local Nurse clothing store. I will only buy these even if the hospital keeps pushing staff to purchase a pre-selected brand in order to homogenize the staff uniforms. I HATE THESE NEW BREATHABLE FABRICS!!!! THEY DO NOT TRAP HEAT AT ALL !!! Only cotton, which Carhartt has, keeps me warm. It is total BS that hospitals expect staff to buy the stretchy, type fabric . Even the jackets made from that material do not keep me warm. I recommend Carhartt completely. Very durable. Hold their color and abuse of multi-washings and dryings. Love the multi-pockets. And love the loose fit. Love the elastic waist band that also have belt loops and the draw string. I mean, it still has some quality, which is thankfully. still part of Carhartt's brand. Thanks Carhartt.",

I tried ordering this 3 times this year and each time got size LARGE. The 3 replacements to “fix” the error were also all LARGE.  Clearly stated the problem and how to fix it on multiple avenues and amazon personal. Was told it would be forwarded to a team that would take care of it. (Hint: that team doesn’t exist, if it did. All they would have to do is delete one letter.. just one to fix this.)  So much wasted time and money packaging and delivering, returning, packing, replacement delivery, returning. Rinse and repeat.  How to fix?  DELETE THE “L” IN THE TITLE!!  Done.  Old review for black XS: I bought a pair of XS locally back in 2016 and those were some rugged pants for sure! My favorite so I bought the SMALL here because it was on sale. Here are some observations.  The XS were made in Vietnam. This SMall is made in Bangladesh. Handling and comparing them both its easy to tell the new stuff doesn’t feel as “heavy duty”. This new fabric is not as heavyweight evidenced by XS and SMALL size pants BOTH weighing approx. 0.8lbs. Although thinner, the material on these new pants do feel a lot “smoother”. (Like comparing 300 thread count sheets to 1000 Egyptian cotton feel).  I’m disappointed the quality isn’t the same, but that is the expected trajectory once a brand establishes their name. Cut cost/maximize profits. Plus, the lowering of quality is across the board affecting all industries- Japanese & German hand tools for example…  I don’t like it, but I get it.  With that said, these still are the best scrubs IMO.",
