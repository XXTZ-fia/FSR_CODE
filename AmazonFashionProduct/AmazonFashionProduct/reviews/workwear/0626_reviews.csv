J.

Fabric seems good And like the side pockets on the solid-colored side. Don't care for the small pockets on the fleece side and probably won't wear it on that side. Only other complaint is that it's a little long. Goes below my waist which may be because I'm short but when it's zipped up it binds uncomfortably at the waist when I sit. Over all very satisfied.,

Not a very heavy version though.  The stitching seems pretty good, and the plaid fleece interior is nice and soft, and not too fluffy.I'm 5'10"" and 200 pounds, so got an XL, which fits well in the shoulders and chest, but seems about a half-inch to an inch short at the bottom.  That may simply be a personal taste/preference thing.  The zippers are metal and not YKK, and the main one has the reversible pull.  Both it and the one on the chest pocket could benefit from the addition of a longer zipper pull, which I'll put on myself.  Zippers are medium-duty at best, and are prone to catching on the adjacent material.I would recommend against washing or drying this in a machine.  The enclosed literature seems to say dry cleaning or handwashing only, and I'd stick to that.  One time in the dryer, and both the inner and outer material will likely shrink, but at different rates.  Beware.All in all, a nice best for cool weather, but one that will need to be looked after a bit.UPDATE: My wife says it's definitely too short and looks ""bell-shaped"" on me.  Not fitted or even straight shaped at all.  Taking a star off for disappointing my wife.",5
