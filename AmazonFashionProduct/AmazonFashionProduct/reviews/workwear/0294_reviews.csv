We like the Dickies look but the traditional fabric can be a tough warm in the summer months in Arizona.  The flex fabric is much lighter and breathes much better, making it bearable to wear an undershirt.  I would have given it 5 starts.  I'm waiting to see if it requires ironing after every wash.  Due to the printing it can't go through the dryer.  The first washing came out a wrinkled mess that required ironing to make it look presentable.  The traditional fabric comes out of the wash and onto a hanger to dry with zero wrinkle issues.",
