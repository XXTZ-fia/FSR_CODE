The fit/shape of the jacket is a little odd, to me anyways.  The shoulders are super wide, which does allow for decent mobility but it creates a very ""box-ey"" fit. Moving your arms/shoulders around tends to lift the whole jacket up quite a lot because of the shoulder fit.  The sleeves are nice, I like the double cuff style with the elastic ends on the inside. They are fairly snug on the wrist/lower forearm however, which doesn't quite lend itself to rolling up your sleeves a bit if you wanted to.",

These are better, actually, and are made in Mexico - not overseas -  if North American MFG matters to you. The specs/features are not fully described online as far as I can tell. This fabric blend is more Poly, less Cotton (20%) than a Carhartt, but it's fine. The 2 big inside pockets have snaps. One of the slash pockets also has a snap. Internal wrist cuffs are new to me but working out. The only thing I might add is an external cuff snap. You can't really go wrong for about $50. When these are fresh you can get away with wearing them anywhere. Will order more. Good job, Red Kap.",2

There is a design flaw, after wearing it for a few days, it starts to lent heavy and stain easily( the material draws a lot of lint/cotton) and it easily stains but not with food. After you wear it a few day, you start to notice the color gets dirty. Thats the downside to the jacket, i would have rather spent the money on the dickies version, the dickies is tougher and stronger. This should be priced in the 20-30$ range based on its quality, other than that the design is good. Since ive had the jacket, i feel like someone else used the jacket, they then dry cleaned it and sent it to me. Its not worth the fee. Youre better off buying the dickies version.",4

Comfortable. Nice and plain without any silly design. People here are complaining about loose threads. If you never worked for a company that provides uniforms, know that you have to trim the loose threads from manufacturing like pretty much anything from a uniform company. The sleeves are a little long but I just cuffed them like in my picture and they are fine now. It's a little short though, it comes down right below the belt line. If you are tall, have a long torso, or don't tuck in your shirts, you might want to get the Red Kap Panel Jacket instead, which is a little longer. I'm 5'7"" and 240 pounds, I got the 2XL and it's a decent fit for me. If you have a gut like me there is not a lot of room for it. I'm about 48"" around the chest and 50"" around at the belly button and it is not tight on my stomach but just about right. If you are fatter than 52"" around the stomach this jacket will be too small when you sit down with it zipped up. If your stomach is more than a couple inches bigger around than your chest, I would say this is not a good jacket design for you. The chest area of the jacket is bigger than the stomach area. My shoulders are 20 inches wide measured from the outside of the arms and it's a good fit. If your shoulders are wider than 21 inches measured from the outside of the arms then this jacket will be too small for you. I can barely get hands in the inside pockets. The palm of my hand is 4"" wide. If the palms of your hands are wider than 4"", the inside pockets will be too small to get your hands in. I wish it had pockets on the chest. The outside pockets are nicely insulated to keep your hands warm. The fabric is a ripstop weave which you cannot see in the pictures. I think it looks cool and will post a picture of it. I also posted a picture of what the inside looks like.",9

Their prices went up and I decided to try this one. This jacket is much better in many ways in my opinion. I like the zipper flap in the front. The cuffs on this are very nice with a hidden knitted cuff under the visible one. The fit is perfect for me.  What I don’t like... though it is a nice touch most pockets have a hidden snap to hold closed. I’m not confident in how they will hold up with regular use. I wish they used a better zipper. Though it works it isn’t that smooth to operate. The waist straps on the sides are non function so it would have been better to leave them off.,4

Most importantly, it has a tailored/tapered cut and fit, so its wide in the chest and shoulders and narrows at the waist. This is exactly the fit I was looking for. The pockets are well designed and the inside pocket is perfect for my cell phone. I wore it in 30 degree weather the other night and I was warm enough. The inside pocket and outer right pocket can both be snapped shut. A nice feature if you have something you want to feel secure about while walking around. I highly recommend this item if you want a fitted look, and do not recommend it if you need something with ""more room in the middle"", For a bigger middle I would suggest a different model, but the quality of Red Kap is top notch.",10

It's relatively lightweight and easy to wear over hoodies, flannel shirts or polos, it is reasonably warm and mildly breathable. A sound option to layer up for outdoors in Spring or Autumn or wear over a t-shirt if working inside. I'm 6'2"", 85kg with long arms a medium fits me well, indicating this Redkap sizing runs large. It has two large inner pockets sealable with press studs, good for phones or notebooks, two outer pockets, one that has a stud and showerproof coating - which is surprisingly effective in medium rain. One complaint is that stitching seems a bit patchy - and while nothing has come undone yet, I have removed more than a couple of loose strands. Pretty happy overall given fit, subtle style and it's suitability as comfortable, practical workwear.",
