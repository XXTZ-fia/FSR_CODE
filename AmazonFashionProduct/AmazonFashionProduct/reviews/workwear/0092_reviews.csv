I have many many Carhartt products jackets/sweatshirts/vests/bibbs/pantsthis vest unlike cathartt is great already broken in already very movable over or under a sweatshirt or jacket the lining is super soft and warm outer layer feels like it will hold up over the test of time. Appealed to me because of the movability and softness of outer shell; anyone that has worn Carhartt knows its not the easiest material to wear. Looking into buying a  jacket now that I know this outer layer will move with me and not be so stiff and rise  up when reaching overhead or bending down. And let’s not forget about the price it’s very affordable and worth the money. Vest 5* try it you won’t regret it.,3

The vest is a bit on the big side though. The shoulder area is wide and a bit stiff so there's always a pretty large gap around my shoulders. The bottom is also a bit wide so it doesn't fit as snug as I expected. I wear 3x for all of my jackets, sweaters, vests, etc; but it might be a good idea to size down one size with this.",
