There’s more storage/pockets than you need which is always a good thing, they are super flexible/comfortable and the BIGGEST sell on these is the elastic waistband. The other big name brands always have weird sizes and maybe the pants fit great, but the waist is too tight or too loose and when you bend down it causes pain. These pants are amazing and worth the price. See for yourself. I hope the industry follows suit in the future, no more outdated stuff work pants!",4

They have a short zipper so no room for all that man stuff. They don’t flex at all. They are like stiff stiff. The waist band is TIGHT. I’m a 34x34 and have been for 20 years. These fit like a 33x34. They are tight. I cut wood for a living and the flat front pockets fill with sawdust. Traditional side slit front pockets are way better at keeping out debris. I really was hoping for better product than this. I know for some this may be the ticket but not if you are around debris or wood working or chainsaws as the pockets fill up. And if you bend over (no stretch) the back wants to pull right off your butt. I’d return but I wore them and they are filthy after a days work.,

Also a 30rd mag (STANAG) fits well in the side pocket, watch pocket is very deep and could easily fit a knife larger than an ontario rat 1, it also has a separate little pocket next to the watch pocket, wide enough for a small knife (barely fits my kizer assassin, I think I have the xl version).

A to small phone pocket.  I wish it was large enough for a 3x5 writing pad. And a hatchet loop.  The right hand pocket has a leather like reinforced corner.  I assume that's for a tape rule, however I have clips on my power tools so I can hang them on my pockets while climbing ladders.These are nice.  The material is light but will not fail.  They keep their appearance well, and being camo, should hide small stains.  Yes my new favorite.I just wrote a review on another style of CQR pant that is not masculine in the slightest.
