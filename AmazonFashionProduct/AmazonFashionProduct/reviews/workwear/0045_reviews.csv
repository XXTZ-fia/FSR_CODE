Most companies have gotten on board with this concept of listing how their product sits on the waist. These shorts SIT LOW ON THE WAIST. I am in good physical shape/condition, I can button my shorts at my normal waistline. I have no need for a low waistline to allow room for my big gut to hang out over the buttons.",2
