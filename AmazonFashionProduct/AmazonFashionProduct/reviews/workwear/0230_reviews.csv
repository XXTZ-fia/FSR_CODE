Earthchild60,Very nice pants in my humble opinion,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PN04BT0U8A3I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B499SHZ6,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 18, 2025",Size: 36W x 32LColor: Cool Charcoal,Verified Purchase,"So I just got these pants. I got dark gray very nice color. They look like work pants which I like. I’m not a dress up kind of guy, but I think you could wear them out and not look like you just got off work. I washed them and they did shrink some, but they’re 98% cotton and anyone expecting them not to shrink is an idiot., I wear a size 36x 32 these fit great I have a bit of a beer belly and they fit just a little snug but they’re stretchy and I don’t like wearing a belt anyway, I’m retired now so I’m not working much so I can’t comment on how well they hold up at work. Some reviews said the pockets are too deep maybe they just have really short arms, some reviews say the leg openings are way too big. Maybe they just have very small feet. I thought the leg openings were a little narrow., Some said the pockets were too snug and hard to getting  hands in, Maybe they just have massive hands., I paid $75 for the pair I bought not the best deal ever but a very good pair of pants as far as I can see try a pair , Send it back if you don’t like  them",

But I find them a little stiff for casual use. Wore them on a long flight recently and wished I’d stuck with my old cotton cargo pants. Lots of pockets, gussets and reinforced areas. So it’s a trade-off. I’ll save them for my next cold weather project where cotton pants would get damaged.",

He picked out a 38x34 and they were a bit big on him, and after a day of work and play?! He’s thinking of another pair. I can say they did shrink up after washing them. And you will be folding these and putting them somewhere?! They will not hang and look normal in the closet, it’s the way they’re cut?! They shape to the wearer and flex well, my husband exclaimed. They will fold and sit on a shelf, or the back of a chair if you’re my husband.",

Larry,Front pockets so small can’t get my hands inside,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SB5L98CPLV28/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B499SHZ6,"1.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2024",Size: 30W x 32LColor: Blue Black,Verified Purchase,"I own and love 3 pairs of these pants in different colors (warm gray x 2, cool gray x 1) and they’re great. However, I just purchased the same size in both black and tombstone — and those two versions are differently patterned and made in Vietnam instead of Egypt. The holes to the front pockets in the pants made in Vietnam are so small I can’t even fit my hands inside them. Moreover the legs are a lot longer than the other pairs. And the whole pant hangs poorly. Disappointed. The pairs made in Egypt fit great. The pairs made in Vietnam feel cheap and like they were sewn by children.",

The fit is as expected.  I usually wear a 33 waist but since it was not offered I went down to 32 as recommended and the fit is great.  The cell phone pocket could be a little wider.  My Samsung 21+ with Otter Box protector case is a very tight fit in the side pocket.  I don't have this issue with Carhartt or my other pants.,
Amazon Customer,Pockets are incorrectly sized and positioned.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36OXFOO1963NC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B499SHZ6,"2.0 "," the United States "," April 14, 2023",Size: 36W x 30LColor: Coyote Brown,Verified Purchase,The front pockets are extremely deep. Have you ever seen a man with a giant rubber glove impregnate a cow? That's what getting a coin from your pocket will look like if you have these pants. Dang near  elbow deep. Each front pocket is like half a backpack. The extra leg pocket on the right side Is perfectly sized but far lower on the leg than you want. Things in that pocket swing when you walk. The fabric and stitching looks excellent. If they fixed  this issue I would buy again. The fit was very good/ true to advertised numbers.,2
Consume!!!,Consistently reliable everyday work pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31BTEH15X4N7Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B499SHZ6,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 9, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"I've been wearing these for work for a couple of years now, and they hold up very well. The inseam is high so the cuffs don't drag and they stack really well with boots. The phone pocket is just the right size and can support heavier objects like rifle magazines. I carry a folding knife with a pocket clip every day, and there isn't a hint of the fabric breaking down where the clip rubs. There are a lot of rivets, to the point of setting off metal detectors.  The rear pockets get kind of saggy if you overload them, and since they are a nylon blend, they aren't exactly chemical or flame resistant so I wouldn't do any woodland firefighting or welding in them.  Overall, these are really good pants. The fit is comparable to Kuhl's and the build quality is far better than Carhartt or Dickies.",4

They are not quite as heavy but the look is very close.  I have three pairs that I wear for work.  The leg opening is wide enough to fit over boots but it is a tapered leg perfect for working in environments where there are things to snag your pants on.  They are very comfortable especially with the added materiel in the waist band.  The cell phone pocket is perfectly located.  They aren't as durable as some more heavy duty brands but I work in a warehouse and they are the best work pants I have had yet.  I have also found them to be the perfect camping pants.  I will buy these for years to come if they stick around.  The attention to stitching in the crotch and knees really adds to the comfort.,6
