With a phone it barely even grabs any. -knee pad pockets are super long and sit a bit low. They seem more like shin guards than knee pad pockets because you barely get any protection unless you shift them all the way up. Maybe it can be fixed with longer pads but I didn't see any info about them nor do they include them despite the high price tag. -pricey but -velcro read pocket is on the left instead of on the right.

The Dewalt pants are superior in every way even though the Cat pants cost $70 and the Dewalt pants $50. The Cat's are sized small, the sewing in the crotch failed after three uses, the Velcro closures on the pockets began peeling off and stopped adhering after two washes and the various pockets aren't very utilitarian. The Protradesman pants fit as expected, have well thought-out and useful pockets and accessories and are stitched up like Fort Knox. I've had to repair the crotch and replace the Velcro on the Cat pants and don't even wear them anymore since I've become familiar with and now rely upon the usefulness of the pockets on the Protradesman pants.

So overall, these are nice pants. I have 2 pair, that I bought in late 2019, and am now finally at the point of needing replacements. The overall fit is great, the utility is wonderful, and they're very comfortable to wear.  Now for the bad, and why these are o ly good, but not great. 1) the amount of distance from the top of the waistband to the cross-seam (where your perineum is) needs to be at least 1.5 to 2 inches longer, for the front half. The back half fits great, but the front is way too snug, which puts a lot of stress on that cross seam area, which is NOT reinforced at all, and it most certainly will be the first part to start failing - and I've yet to figure out a long-term solution to extend the life of it either. 2) The stitching for the belt loops is absurdly questionable, and doesn't take long to fail. This, of course, wouldn't even be an issue, were issue 1 non-existent, as that is what causes the stress on the loop stitching. 3) the knee pads are placed a good 2-3 inches too low, so if you need to squat or sit, you have to pull the pant legs up first, or the pads will pull the pants downward as you move into that position. Idk what person would wear these and NOT frequently be in such a situation, so this flaw is just inexcusable.  As I said, they're good, but not great. If Dewalt would fix these big flaws, these would be the most perfect on the market. I wear mine quite often, as they've been my workday pants since I bought them, and I've a full time job, so perhaps I've gotten my money out of them, but it's just ridiculous that I have to replace them already because of something so ridiculous as the groin section being of poor design and quality.",
