I love the look and fit. I find it incredibly comfortable.  As to what others say about it wrinkling: this is true, but in my experience only up until you wash the shirt 5 or so times. After washes and wear, the shirt does seem to live up to its description, and becomes comfortable and clean-looking. (In any case, if you’re worried, the navy and dark navy show wrinkles the least.)  I do hem the shirts, as I prefer to have the option to untuck my shirts. This is not a problem with the shirt, in my opinion. Out of the box, they are entirely too long to wear untucked, though this has the benefit of making it so that, when tucked, they will stay that way.  I wish there were more color options available (perhaps a dark brown, a red, or a maroon), though the option for white does leave open the door for dyeing.",3

Too small for my dad. Bought it as a gift. Returned it with the other shirt that was too small as well. Bought the same shirts in correct size. Dad loves them The refund was only credited for one of the two shirts. Unable to contact Amazon to fix this error. It is my hope Amazon will see this and help correct this error.,
