Overall I’d say I’m satisfied. The material appears to be rip stop type fabric, but it’s much thicker than normal and appears to be more similar to the thickness of jeans than ripstop. The length of the shorts is a bit longer and I wanted for it comes down below my knees a couple inches. The pockets are nearly just right, the only suggestive change would be to have the left cargo pocket angled instead of being square to make it easier to open and close. I think the color matches what was shown on the webpage, but to be honest, this was for work wear so I don’t really care what they look like. The only negative aspect is there was a ton of threads hanging out all over the ends of seams where it looks like the sowing machine had to stop and reposition.",

I've been wearing these for several years. Lots of pocket room. They are very tough. If you like shorts with really soft material these are not for you. They are thicker than average and made from a tough ripstop heavy canvas material. Another plus if needed is that they come in odd numbered waist sizes. I can wear a 29 but with my pockets pretty full(yes I'm worse than a kid for stuffing my pockets full of ""just in case"" items) a 30 waist fits me best. Be sure and turn them inside out to wash. It just keeps them from fading as much as they would otherwise. They do not fade bad anyways. They do not shrink much when laundered either.",

I particularly like that fabric as it is very lightweight and yet very durable. For summertime use it's an ideal fabric. These shorts are loose fitting and comfortable enough. They are a long inseam and will interfere with knee pads,  if you're using those. My major concern/ complaint & unhappiness with the product comes from the fact that there are enormous pockets that things get lost in,  but no pocket that is small enough & deep enough to contain a Carpenters pencil without having it fall out randomly and regularly! The right side pant leg has two smaller tool pockets. One is a slash cut that normally would be for the carpenter pencil. The problem with that pocket is it's too deep at the top and the pencil gets lost in the pocket.  Also the top of the slash pocket is covered by the snap clip and lip of the enormous cargo pocket. The combination creates an obstruction.  I need ready access on a regular basis to the pencil. I have neither time nor patience to go hunting through the pockets to find it. Possibly surface stitched pencil/pen pockets on the outside of the slash pocket with the ideal.  The other pocket is way too small/shallow to be functional. See pictures. These are not great shorts for Carpenter work.  The hammer loop is far too small and tight to function as a hammer loop. Generally this type of loop is stitched in with one leg lower than the other to cause the loop to be addressable more easily. My hammer handle will not even go through the loop, let alone allow it to be pulled back out. A loop should allow for one-handed in / out operation. These shorts do not function as such at all! This feature on these shorts is for"" looks only""! The tape measure clip pocket protector looks like it would be a great feature on these shorts. However upon receiving them I find that the material that was used is a very thin piece of plastic. I do not think that it will endure many washing and drying cycles. This appears to me to be another looks only design feature. Only Time Will tell.  Hopefully the designer will redesign these with more functional pockets. Until then, Carharts are much better design.
