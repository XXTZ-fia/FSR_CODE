I needed black slacks for a new service job and after reading many reviews about sizing, I opted to originally buy a 2short and a 4short, as most complaints were in the fit at the natural waist being super large. I got the 4short first and I could barely, BARELY get them up over my bum. They fit in the natural waist, but the crotch seam was so tight I could barely stand to have them on for a second longer. The length in the leg was pretty perfect, though. I did eventually buy a size 6short, which I can slide on comfortably and  the crotch seam fits appropriately. The length of the pant leg is almost too long, and , there is a decent amount of gapping at the natural waist. I’m going to get a belt and have them hemmed slightly.If you are a petite woman with a little extra curve I would purchase true to size of what you’d normally buy at the store to start, and order a backup pair as well.",4
