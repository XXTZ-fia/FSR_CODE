I wish they were higher rise, I will definitely be making sure to wear them with longer shirts and I'm sure I'll be pulling them up constantly since I usually wear higher rise jeans. But they'll get the job done and I won't look terrible. They run a little big but I don't have time to return and reorder so they'll work. They're also longer than expected based on my measurements but thankfully my boots are clunky so they won't drag.",11

Buyer373389,Sizing off and returns horrible - do not buy on amazon,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26L1UN8KQA6IN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B085RVZPTH,"1.0 "," the United States "," August 13, 2021",Size: 5-30Color: Dark Indigo,Verified Purchase,The size chart for this must be incredibly off.

OpinionsRLike...,NOT mid-rise (definitely lower),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZSMWMUWFBOWN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B085RVZPTH,"3.0 "," the United States "," May 29, 2021",Size: 11-32Color: Dark Indigo,,"These jeans are a nice, thick denim with almost no stretch (which is way too hard to find). They feel very high quality. Unfortunately, no way are these ""mid-rise"" as advertised. I wear a US women's size 10 (30 waist in Levis and at H&M); I am 5 foot 7, 165 pounds, with a short torso, wide hips, flat derriere, and long legs. I ordered these jeans in the ""11W x 32L"" size, and while they fit snugly, I had no trouble zipping them. Not only was the rise low enough to cause the dreaded ""muffin top"" effect, bending over showed a LOT of my undies. The fit reminded me of the jeans I used to wear back in the late 90s, when I was 20 years younger, 20 pounds lighter, and trying to show off my belly-button piercing; this low waist would have worked on that girl, but not on this middle-aged mom (who officially denies any body piercings, lol). Since these are supposed to be jeans for work, I'm not sure they would work for anyone (except plumbers.... ;-) Tl;dr Nicely constructed jeans, but the rise is too low for a work environment. If I had it to over, I would not have ordered these.",7

These I thought ran a little small especially in the thigh area and I couldn't wear them (I have large thighs). They are a tough pair of well made jeans and won't tear or rip easily.

Charmin' Farmer,"Moderately booty hugging. Unsure of fire retardant-ness, but they're compliant for work!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IJUI4K77RLIW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B085RVZPTH,"5.0 "," the United States "," April 30, 2021",Size: 11-32Color: Dark Indigo,,"These are moderately backside hugging jeans and fit me great. I typically wear a 34 in the waist, or an 11 in jeans and these fit nicely. The waist goes up a bit higher, but it lets me bend easier and gives me more room to bend without accidentally showing more flesh than I intend. Plus, they're in a 32 length, which is great for me with longer legs at 5'7"". I don't know about the actual fire retardant-ness of them, but that's not something I want to actively test. They're CAT2 and compliant for work, which works out great for me. Comfy, dark wash, and they don't make things appear flatter than they are. They actually have a slight flare to the legs as a kind of 90s vibe, and they hug the hips nicely.",
