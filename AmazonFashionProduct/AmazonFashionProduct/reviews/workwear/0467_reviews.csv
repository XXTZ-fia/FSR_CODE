Freddy G.,"This has become my daily go-to casual shirt, for good reasons I will list below.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DD7R4JGANZ82/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YHFBVJK,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 4, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Forest Green,Verified Purchase,"I have several of these  Wrangler Riggs shirts in long sleeve and short sleeve and various colors.  What I like about them is that they are rugged (as far as shirts like this go), don't make me sweat, are super comfortable, not too expensive, a good value for the dollar, and last but certainly not least, they fit me very well. Note that they are ROOMY, not form fitting like regular tee shirts tend to be.  I am 6'0"" and around 273 lb, and an XXL is perfect on me, in case that gives you any useful guidance.  I should also mention, don't confuse the straight-up Wrangler shirts with the Wrangler Riggs shirts!  I've tried several of both in the XXL size, and the Riggs version is clearly a better fit (slightly more generous).  The Riggs version is, I think, a slightly better quality in terms of material and construction, and although the Riggs version costs a few dollars more, it is WELL worth it, in my experience.",

Ibuyamazon,Sleaves are shorter than older shirts from Riggs  Fit quality is poor compared to older Riggs shirts.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R154ACUDLGBFVR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YHFBVJK,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 1, 2013",,Verified Purchase,"I love my older Riggs long sleeve pocket tees.  The material is thick, the necks fit snug and the pockets are roomy and the sleeves are just the right length.  The little accessory loop in the pocket is a bonus that I use for my pen.  I have received good comments on these shirts with other people wanting to know what brand they were.I've worn these shirts for casual wear with jeans when I would go out but thought they were too good to wear for working in my home shop under cars or around the farm, etc.  In the past I purchased cheap 3-per-pack pocket long sleeve tees for this purpose.  My last ones were Stafford brand but these were a thin material, the pockets were ridiculously small and the neck stretched A LOT and looked and felt sloppy.  I was ashamed to wear them into town if I had to run in for parts.  I finally told my wife that I was old enough now that I shouldn't have to put up with sub par quality cheap stuff and was going to bite the bullet and buy the Riggs shirts to wear all the time and throw my old cheap shirts away.  I ordered 4 shirts from Amazon in navy, green, gray (ash) and burgundy.  When the shirts arrived, my wife thought they were thinner material than the older shirts.  I told her to wait until they were washed and then we would judge them.  She machine dried the shirts just like all of the older shirts have been dried the past couple of years.  The material plumped up after washing and drying and felt similar to the older shirts.  BUT, the sleeves were noticeably shorter on the first three shirts I wore.  Then I wore the green shirt yesterday & noticed what seemed like oil splatter on the chest of the shirt.  I wore it under a jacket so it wasn't noticeable and thought if it still was stained after a second washing, I would send it back.  The sleeves on the green shirt were as long as my old shirts.  Today the gray, burgundy and green shirts were washed and instead of machine drying them, they were hung on the line.  When all three shirts were hung together, the sleeves on the gray and burgundy shirts were noticeably shorter by 2 to 2-1/2"" compared to the green shirt which was hanging between them.I am so disappointed in the lack of quality control on this brand.  I've looked at other brands and didn't like them as well as the Riggs brand.  Riggs also seems to have discontinued some colors and now only has about 4 colors left so maybe the whole line is going away.  Sad!  On a happier note, the stain on the green shirt which fits like my older Riggs shirts seems to have disappeared.Edited 12-13-13.  Update on 4 Riggs Long Sleeve shirts.  All shirts have been washed 2 times.  Stain on green shirt is almost gone; the stitching on the burgundy shirt right sleeve where it meets the cuff is coming out (has two row stitching, one is pulling out all around the cuff); on the 2nd wearing of the navy shirt noticed a hole right below the collar on the right shoulder about 1/8"" in diameter.So, so very disappointed in the quality on the new shirts.",5

Mojave Mike,Very fine shirt,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Y7HVY8BLLZNM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YHFBVJK,"4.0 "," the United States "," May 29, 2010",Size: X-LargeColor: Forest Green,Verified Purchase,"I don't give fives except in extreme circumstances.  These shirts are well made, not a light weight cloth. I got the XL's - I've a 19 1/2 inch neck, 6' tall, and fairly wide wingspan. The neck is comfortable, the sleeves go to the wrist, in about a dozen washings there is no shrinkage. They seem durable and colorfast. I bought them for working in the yard and on cars.  The pocket is a great benefit, and has a little loop inside at the top, perfect for holding sunglasses in place (or a pen for the geek effect).  The only annoyance is the tag, which can be cut off.",5
