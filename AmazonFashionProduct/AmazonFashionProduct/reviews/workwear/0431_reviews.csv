Does Amazon even have that option of notifications?,

There is no shortage of pockets and they are, actually, kinda flattering. Most cargo pants of thjis type (unisex-sizing, heavy on the pockets) tend to look overly mannish...these don't. I ordered the size 8/28 and though they are a bit tight (my mistake, not theirs), I'm keeping them for my skinny days (my weight fluctuates 10 pounds up and down throughout the seasons). I just ordered another pair in a size 10/30...they should fit my winter derriere just fine. (If they should go on sale again for $21.00, I'll be buying several more pairs!)",3

I love that there is a sinch at the bottom, that's especially helpful for tucking the pant leg into boots. However, the pants are much longer than I expected. The fit at the waist is accurate, but they are far too long for me at 5'4. They are even too long for my partner at 5'7. That is the main reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. They are only wearable for us if we are wearing shoes that the legs are able to tuck into. Other than that, they are great pants with a fantastic number of pockets. The black is also a nice, dark, deep color.",2

They are a thick material that doesn't tear easily. They do have a little bit of weight to them but have a drawstring inside the belt area and they don't slip down. There's eight usable pockets and they have buttons that push through. This is the only thing that I struggle with because I usually have my hands full when I am trying to put stuff in my pockets so snaps would be easier.,5

They were also very long. They do have a tie at the bottom so you can tighten them at your ankle to keep them from drooping down and having you walk on them. However, there was much more material than expected. Also, the material is so thick. They are definitely durable and tactical in style, so that may be expected, I just thought the tightness, length, and thickness of the material made them seem confining and restrictive and  not comfortable at all.",2
