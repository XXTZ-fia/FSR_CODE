Gerald M.,Better in my opinion than Carhartt FR,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EJGMXVWKPDBH/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09LP8GX95,"5.0 "," the United States "," May 21, 2017",Size: 32W x 32LColor: Medium Fade,Verified Purchase,"I used to buy nothing but Carhartt FR Jeans.  A few annoyances that I have had with the Carhartts is that the belt loops are in awkward places.  When placing a Leatherman or Gerber multi function tool on a belt, it would either be either too far forward or too far back. The fly on the Carhartt is cut weird where it almost seems like you have to stand on your tippy toes to go to the bathroom.  The zipper just doesn't seem to open far enough.  These Wranglers have corrected both issues besides being much more comfortable in general.  They are also less than 2/3 the price of what I used to pay.  I plan on buying these from now on.",
