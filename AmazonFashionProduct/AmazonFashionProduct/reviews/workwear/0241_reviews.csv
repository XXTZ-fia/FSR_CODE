Not tight and not uber baggy. I love how they fit and look. They are a little bit stretchy, and super comfortable.  You have your 2 side and back pockets, along with another pocket on the bib. The straps are adjustable, and also has 3 buttons on each side on the hips. Nothing sticks out awkwardly, as it is the case with some bibs. The leg part is folded and stitched into place. Love that it has belt loops, in case you want to put a belt on. Also looks great with those chain type belts, and a cute crop top. It appears to be made of great quality, and I have found that it helps when using the bip clips to just hold the button with your index finger and thumb in place, so you don't tug on it too much.  If you happen to have a little pooch, as I do, it does not accentuate that at all, it hides it quite nicely. I also like that the crotch part sits perfectly, and it's not too baggy or hanging down to your knees. That was something I was a bit worried about as I am a little bit on the taller side.  I did not notice any weird smell, as some reviewers have mentioned, just your normal new clothes smell. I have also had no problems with any shrinkage when washing. I do wash this in cold water on the delicate cycle, put in the dryer on air fluff only, and then finish air drying hung up.  I absolutely highly recommend these, I think it's a great addition to anyone's wardrobe, and these rompers/overalls/bibs are really in style right now, and fairly priced as well.",4

They are my preferred way to dress most of the time. This summer I thought it was about time to try out the shorter style of overall - shortalls. And because I live in Florida and long overalls are a bit too much for summer, it was time for a change. I am so glad I made the switch. These 5 pocket shortalls are as good as any brand of long overalls I have ever worn. They are very well made of a medium weight denim. I chose Color B, Light Blue featuring my favorite cargo style patch pockets in front. The cross back design is a fantastic look and emphasizes a tapered waist. I ordered my usual size and the fit is perfect. Order one size larger if you prefer to wear your shortalls loose. I have one question. Why are there beltloops?",

As a result, I was cautious and ordered up. I wanted to be sure about the inseam and my thighs/hips.  Turns out? There was no need. When they arrived and went on, my pair (Style A in black XXL) fit a bit big, but not TOO bad. No rips, tears and are heavy gauge denim — very well made. I’ll have to snag the same style or Style B in a dark blue.  Overall (no pun)? I love em!! Just be mindful of your style preference and sizing before ordering 👌🏾",8
