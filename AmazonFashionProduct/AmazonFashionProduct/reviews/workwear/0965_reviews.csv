These are definitely for those who prefer a slim look. Being 6’6” and athletic I chose the medium tall size, they fit perfectly! They’re very “spandexy” though, the pictures on here look like a flat color and texture, but the black and pewter are both very shiny and glossy, think swimming trunks material and definitely not twill. They’re made in Vietnam so the quality control is definitely consistent and thorough. The pockets are very well placed and useful, and they seem durable for such thin fabric, and the stitching looks very strong. Medium fits my 32” waist slightly snug and there’s no need to tie them. As soon as I wore the first pair for a full day I immediately ordered 6 more pairs. The days of limited movement at work are over if you purchase these in the right size. I highly recommend these for comfort and coolness on hotter days at work. And FYI: the black ones look really cool with high tops or even have a slight military look with the right black boots if you’re into that. These will definitely get some miles put on them this warm season..",4

My inseam is 27.5 - 28"", depending on the style. I can buy 31W 28L slim fit chinos from Gap and they fit perfectly. I am 5' 6"" and 150 lbs, with a slender/athletic build that is slightly wider than most guys that are my height. I spend a lot of time running so I have short, stocky legs with larger than average quadriceps. I ordered the small short in these joggers and they were a little tight I the hips, thighs, waist, and seat, but I really liked the length. They hit right at the ankles and don't bunch up. So I decided to buy the medium short, since the inseam is supposed to be the same regardless of the waist size. The medium short fits almost perfectly, so close to perfect that I will probably buy another pair. I was hoping they would fit a little tighter in the thighs, like track pants, but they have a little bit more room there, and you can hardly tell. It's probably better that they have more room anyway, and I might decide I like the way these fit better. The length is the same as the small short, a perfect comfortable fit. There is plenty of room in the seat and the rise is not too tight or too baggy. I can move around freely and they look flattering on my legs (a rare thing since most pants don't fit right). The material is a lightweight tech poly. It is not sheer and can be worn as outerwear, exercise wear, or sleepwear. An excellent idea for a clothing product, I'm glad I found a pair that fits!  Update: I ordered a second pair in pewter, and they don't fit. I ordered the medium short again, and they fit exactly the same as the blue, but the inseam is clearly longer by at least 1.5"" maybe 2"" (I didn't measure, I just held them against each other). The fit is not as good, they bag at the ankles. It's as if they mislabeled the item as a medium short when it is actually a medium. Now I'm afraid to order more items because I don't know what I'm going to get. I guess I'll settle for one good blue pair that fits, and I'll try some other brands. Disappointing!  Update 2: I noticed in the photos that the wine and royal colors looked shorter on the model than the pewter color. The black color looked like it was in-between. I ordered the wine color and compared them to the navy color that I purchased and described above. The wine color is only 3/4"" - 1"" longer and you can't really tell when you put them on. Also they are a tiny bit more snug in the waist, so they don't fall as low on the hips as the navy pair. The fact that they sit a little higher on the waist makes up for the extra length and I think they really look the same as the navy pair, so I kept them. Otherwise the fit is the same as the navy pair and they are great. I will definitely wear and enjoy these. I am glad that I was able to get a second color!",

solara,Women customers... caution! They stretch out!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RS5NRSOPHQ9OB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07L37FB9Q,"4.0 "," the United States "," January 16, 2023",Size: MediumColor: Navy,,"I'm a large woman—less curvy—just large overall. I'm 5'11"" and typically wear women's 12 and men's 34 with a 32"" inseam. I love men's cut pants for the length, rise and pockets. And I LOVE THESE JOGGERS!! I like them better than leggings and yoga pants because of the smooth fabric, deep pockets, and great length. The only thing I don't like about them is how they stretch out.  I read through the reviews. They appear to be written by men—makes sense. And the images show them being a little loose on them—also makes sense. But I wanted these to be a little more form-fitting like yoga pants—more flattering on my figure.  I ordered Medium and Large in Regular length. The length is perfect—not cropped like women's joggers, but not swimming at the ankle, just right. The M was too tight at first and hard to even pull on, whereas the L fit perfectly. But after an hour, the Large stretched out to the point of being uncomfortable and incredibly unflattering. I put them in a hot washer & dryer to see if that would help. They held up magnificently and shrunk a tad, but again within an hour they were too big. Then I tried the M. They were tight at first, but within an hour (or less), they stretched out to fit like the Large did out of the package. I've since washed the Medim with a hot dryer and they're perfect. I now have 4 pairs of them.",

I have a pair of black Figs as well in the exact same size and the Figs are a lot more baggy and the crotch is a lot lower when compared to these. I don’t like having to pull my pants up every time I need to squat down. For me, these were a perfect fit.",6

Not too big on labels, but more so on product convenience, breathability, etc. Much like any given dark fabric, follow cleaning instructions and it’ll stay as dark/in shape as during its inception.

The joggers fit around the waist, with a wide waist band that neutralizes the cut/dig in to gut feel and it was tapered down to the ankles giving an overall wonderful fit.
