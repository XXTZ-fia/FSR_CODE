First off i have to mention the button and loop on the back of the neck. It is there to pull in and secure the higher neckline which in concept is a cute idea but in reality, it’s very poorly done. The elastic loop, that goes over the button, is WAY too small. I fussed with it for a while when putting on the shirt.. i have long nails and it was incredibly hard to get the loop over the button. But, the real frustration came when trying to get it off. I literally couldn’t get it off which meant I couldn’t get the shirt off.. when buttoned, I can’t get it over my head. So, I tried to have someone help me unbutton it but even they couldn’t get it. So eventuality i just had to cut the loop just to get the shirt off. So now my shirt has a cut loop that I’m honestly too busy to fix. I am sure I’ll get around to it but i only wore the shirt that one time. Really annoying that such a small detail could practically ruin the top. The loop doesn’t need to be small for any reason and, i can’t wear the shirt unbuttoned because, well, it looks undone obviously. I did notice other reviewers mentioned that they had this issue, I wasn’t sure if it was just my shirt but, this does seem to be a common enough problem/flaw and something to keep in mind.  Otherwise the shirt fit well. The color is beautiful. I didn’t find the top to be super soft but it’s not uncomfortable by any means. The only place that’s a tad uncomfortable is the elastic around the wrists. The shirt fit properly but the elastic was a little too tight around my wrists. The top is also decently made. Seams are straight and i didn’t notice any defects. The style is flattering but I personally think it’s a little boxy untucked. I wore it tucked in and it looked cuter.  Overall, i think it’s a fine top but since i only got to wear it once and then had to literally cut it off, I can’t give it more than an average rating of 3 stars..",

It looks great on the model in the picture. When I got it on it just wasn't a flattering fit. I have a large bust and I think the ribbed material in the front looked weird.  The material is not as soft as I had hoped either.,

Brenda Marie,Butterflies n is IMPOSSIBLE. Looks blah on - sleeves nice and long,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IURIDI91OLGX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C8LVD9H9,"4.0 "," the United States "," September 4, 2023",Color: RosaSize: XX-Large,,"I am tempted to rate it lower, but the shirt is just not for me. It just looks blah on. There’s no styling to the front and it just does nothing for me tucked or untucked. Which is a shame because I think the color is fabulous. The material is nice and flowy and very feminine.  I always order up a full size or a few sizes to get that flowiness and I am also tall so I try to get more length that way as well. The sleeves are definitely very long for this tall girl - that I am very pleased with.  The button that you have on the back is impossible to button. It is the tiniest tiniest little stretchy loop and a big giant button. And good luck as once you do get it buttoned, it is impossible to get it unbuttoned. So I think I’m going to attach a little snap to this instead. But then again, I may just give the shirt away because it just looks flat on me. There’s no styling to the front there’s no… I’m not too happy with it but again, it may work for you.  Had potential at least. I do wish the neck line was different for that. The breast area was pleated differently, or that there was some kind of shape to it, but it just looking flat and blah on me…",

I am pretty sensitive to fabrics so it took me a few minutes at first to get used to the feel of this, but it was fine after that.  I ordered a size small and am 5’7 and roughly 125 pounds.

Not something I want in a business environment.  However, taking that into consideration, overall, it is a good look for business wear.I used the sizing chart in the product description and based on that ordered a medium.  I am still not sure, but I am thinking I should have gone with a large, my normal size.  It is a little tight in the body.  The front pleats are starting to expand, so I will likely wear a minimizer bra with this top.  and the sleeves are just barely long enough.",5
