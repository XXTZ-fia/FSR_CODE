I originally bought a pair with 32 inch length, way tooo long, returned them no problem (great customer service btw) they were repolaced with a 30 inch length, wow, I almost feel I should have gone with a 28"" or 26"" and I am not exaggerating I have to roll these up at least 4"" so I am not dragging hem on the ground.  Maybe I got a mismeasured pair, but I have already washed and worn expecting they would be in the right length so I will live with them but if you can try on a pair at a store before ordering do it so you can make sure your size is right.  FYI I'm 74 inches tall and I've been measured as a 30"" length by tailors so it just maybe a Dickies thing or a one-off.",

Decently heavy fabric and 7 belt loops. (end of what I like)  Out of 3 pairs purchased one has the correct inseam. One pair is one inch too short and another is three inches too short. It seems these are cut for people with large butts. Very large butts! This strikes me as odd because overweight men typically develop large bellies rather than large butts. In the end they are a huge disappointment but at least a relatively inexpensive disappointment.,

However, one of the pairs of these four jeans that I purchased I had the metal top button break off about two weeks ago and need to be screwed back on, so I added in super glue to ensure it won't come loose again, at least for a while.  It's not a world ending flaw and it was a very easy under 5 minute fix, but it was disappointing that it happened this early on in their use. It probably was just a fluke as I've worn various styles of Dickies pants over the past several years for work and days off and never had one do that before, but I still have to ding some points for that. That being said, despite my one slightly offbeat experience, I would still recommend these to anyone looking for affordable but rugged jeans.

If it doesn't meet these criteria, then I will most definitely and descriptively tell the short comings of the products and you as a consumer will not have to go through the trouble of buying the product without some background knowledge.
