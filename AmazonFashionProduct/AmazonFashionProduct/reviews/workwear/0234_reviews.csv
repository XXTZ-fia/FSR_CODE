I purchased the same model number only large in black and Made in Indonesia as of Dec 2024.The contrast is the 2021 USA (gray) coat's liner feels and looks like a comforter, the 2024 outsourced black version from Indonesia is thinner and with the texture of a blanket. The 2024 version is quilted and warm, but I strongly suggest not relying upon the Indonesian (4th world) version in 32 degree or less temperatures. I went outside wearing the 2024 version in 27 degree weather for 5 minutes and felt the cold coming through the coat.The pictures are only a sample and lack detail to thoroughly show the differences between the Indonesia 2024 black model versus 2021 gray USA version. Carhartt customer service politely listened to my concerns and advised no one else had reported quality control issues with products outsourced to other countries.  However, there are many internet reviews on the new thinner inferior versions. The summary is the quality is not the same, the new thinner version may be serviceable for cooler temperatures above 32 degrees, not personally recommended for long outside work.",3

I got recommended to it by my friend’s dad who had the same jacket (J-130) for over 25 years. I can tell why it held up for so long. This jacket is perfect for work in the cold or just for styling your outfits (I know you kind of people exist). The fabric this is made of is absolutely astounding and the stitching matches that as well. Along with that, there’s so many features that aren’t advertised on here like the inside zipper pockets and pen holder built into the right side hand pocket. The design of the cuffs allow for a perfect fit with any winter style/skiing glove. The part that absolutely sold me on this jacket was the zipper though. Typically Carhartt kind of misses on their zippers in my experience (especially with their backpacks and lunchboxes) but this one is very high quality. The one downside I can think of this jacket is the plastic aglets (the things on the end of the hood drawstring). Other than that, this jacket is perfect and 100% worth the $130 price tag.",36
