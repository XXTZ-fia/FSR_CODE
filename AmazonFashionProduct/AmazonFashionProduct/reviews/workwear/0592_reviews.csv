It might be wise to go one size larger. They are comfortable the way they are sized, but just a might tight to get on. Once on though, they are a very comfortable shirt. The material wicks away moisture well, doesn’t hold body odor and does help with the “sweat factor”. They dry very quickly and vent well. They also respond well to Oxi Clean or Spray and Wash and do not hold stains. I am a truck driver and grease is a constant in my day. These shirts have been washed a few times now and they wash out clean. The reflective striping seems to show signs of wear quicker than I had hoped, but it is still working after a few washes. Overall, I think I’m going to be pleased with this product. Shirt has clean lines and looks professional. Well styled.",2
