I ordered a 2x set and the sizing was way off, The pants were not only short they fit snug. I am a size xl but these 2xs felt like a xl. I love the variety of pockets on the pants though. The shirt it fit snug for a 2x and was disappointed the shirt had only 1 pocket which was on the chest area , which did not help holding things I needed  for doing my job.  I loved the wonderful color of this set and think for a scrub set price is okay, but choosing a size think bigger .",

The waist was huge, the length way too short and super tight around the ankle area. It won't stop me from wearing them however. They are still very comfortable and fashionable. They would almost be perfect if the joggers weren't so off in the sizing.",2
