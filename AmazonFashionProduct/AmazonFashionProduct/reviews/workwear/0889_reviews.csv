This is an objective review based on my use of this product. All opinions are my own.I've  been looking for warmer weather tops to piece into my Spring and Summer wardrobe here in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Tops that can easily transition from casual to more dressy and professional wear.  Saw this lovely Zeago top, and thought I would give it a try.My-oh-My, this top is an absolute must have for versatility in your warmer weather wardrobe!  Everything about it exceeded my expectations.  Lovely soft and comfortable fabric; the beautiful light tan and very dark navy blue strip color combination is a neutral that blends in with all of my wardrobe.  Love the chic asymmetrical hem and slits in the sleeves.  The sleeves have a beautiful flow to them, with a length falling just about elbow length on me.  Perfect!Excellent quality and craftsmanship, the inside seaming does not irritate my sensitive skin.  Love the fashionable ribbed edging and the very comfortable crew neck.  This wonderful top easily transitions from casual to dressy or professional wear with the addition of accessories such as a necklace or scarf.  Great for cooler weather to layer under a cardigan or a jacket.  A wonderful value, too.I recommend cold water wash and air dry for the best care of this lovely top.I highly recommend this product.",11

It quickly became one of my favorite tops. It says it is short sleeved, but they don't feel or look like short sleeves to me. A little longer than what I imagine short sleeves to be. They go down to the elbow. But that is perfectly fine for me. It's really cute that way. I was worried that it might wear too warm, but it doesn't. And it doesn't wear heavy at all.
