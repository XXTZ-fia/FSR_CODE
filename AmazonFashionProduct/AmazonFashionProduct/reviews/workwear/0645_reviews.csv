See pic for reference. I read a lot of reviews that said that to size down and I’m glad I went with the Large. Hips don’t lie and I have a booty. So if you are a thick girly, go with Large . I wished the seams were made better. These pants on me are a looser fit not too baggy but loose enough. The problem was when I sat down the seam pulled the 1st time wearing them. Dickies have always been made to last and these scrub pants were a bit disappointing in that regard.",

S. Johnson,Avoid if you have big thighs (or if you can't stand itchy seams),https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZRK43IRGUOUJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CN3K6Q1H,"2.0 "," the United States "," July 21, 2024",Size: XX-LargeColor: Navy,Verified Purchase,"Sigh. It is my fate in life to be a shape that no clothing manufacturer can believe exists. Specifically, I have big thighs and a short torso. “WhaaaAAAAATTTT?” say all the clothing manufacturers of the world in unison. “Such things cannot be! Surely no woman in the history of ever has had big thighs! And if any woman ever did, she would necessarily have to have a long torso! Never mind where we got such an idea, we just know it’s true! Therefore, if we ever make a pair of women’s pants cut loose in the thighs, it must have a waist high enough to hit most women at the bra band!”  Being a shape that doesn’t exist, I’m pretty much forced into wearing oversized drawstring pants, because if I can pull them up over my thighs, maybe I can tie the drawstring just tightly enough to keep the pants up and just loosely enough to keep the overly-high waistband from gouging into my rib cage when I sit down. But even drawstring pants aren’t a safe bet. These pants are just another edition of failure. From the middle of the thigh to the knee, they’re skin-tight. As a side effect of being skin-tight, the seams dig into my skin, and those seams have got to be the most insanely itchy seams I have ever encountered. I might be able to put up with the tightness, but not the itchiness. So…now I’m back to square one. Again. Arrghhh.  Also, in case you wanted to know, the pants are too long for me, and the cuffs have a V-shaped vent that makes them impossible to roll up and complicated to hem. (It’s another mystery of the universe. All medium-length pants are too long for me. I don’t think I have short legs, because if I had both a short torso and short legs, I’d be short. But I’m not. The average height for US women is about 5’4”, and I’m 5’6”--not tall, maybe, but definitely on the high side of average. So I conclude that clothing manufacturers think the average US woman is 5’9”. Can somebody please go slap the manufacturers now? And let them know that, no, we do NOT all want our pants to fit like Saran Wrap in the thighs?)",
