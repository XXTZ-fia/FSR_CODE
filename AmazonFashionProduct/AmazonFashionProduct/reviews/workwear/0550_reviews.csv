The current pictures online make this look like a heathered camel-tan with heathered greyish-black accents, and the color online that I purchased even states ""Smoke grey"", but upon arrival, none of the colors on the actual shirt match the description or each other. The main color is a solid khaki tan that doesn't even match the slightly heathered camel sleeves, and the accent color is solid black... It makes the entire shirt look very cheap and not put together. The fit is great, which makes it even more of a bummer about the colors. 2 stars instead of 1 for the comfortable fit and structure. Will be returning unless seller can match what's in the online pictures to exchange.",
