Because it’s cotton (which was a positive in my decision process) it wrinkled that much more in the initial wash, but my handheld steamer did a good job of making it presentable.  Amazon suggested a Medium, but the Small fits fine. Even that is wide for me through the body.

The color makes it so cute and cheerful. The color is as shown in the seller's photos; it's a good deep/bright yellow, not pale, not too orange, not too green. I like the vertical stripes as they are somewhat slimming. I also like the relaxed fit. This shirt has a generous cut but isn't huge. I recommend ordering a size down if you want it more fitted. I have a 44-inch bust so I ordered a size L based on the size chart, and there's plenty of wiggle room and definitely a relaxed fit. The fabric is 100% cotton, and did shrink a little in the wash, so the generous fit helped out in that department. The fabric is smooth cotton sheeting that crisps up nicely when ironed with a bit or starch, or is softer without starch.  This blouse has a shirttail hem that is a bit longer in the back than in the front, and curves up somewhat on the sides. It is plenty long enough to tuck in, and also looks nice and slouchy when worn out. You could also tie it at the waist since the shirttails have plenty of length. You can roll the cuffs up as shown, or wear them down and buttoned. It looks cute with black jeans as shown in the seller's photos, and I also like it with blue jeans. You could dress it up with nice slacks and wear it to work.  Overall, this blouse has classic button-down styling, a generous, comfortable cut, is in cheerful yellow and I love the lightweight cotton sheeting. It's a great basic in a fun color.",
