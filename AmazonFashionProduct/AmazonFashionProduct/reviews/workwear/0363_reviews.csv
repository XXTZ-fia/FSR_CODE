Also I’m pretty sure they say they are pre shrunk but that is not true my wife put it through the dryer by accident and now it’s just plain uncomfortable to wear since I had to downsize and the shirt was just barley comfortable to wear in the first place.

Here are some key points from my experience:  **Pros:**  1. **Lightweight and Comfortable**: At 6.25oz, the shirt is impressively lightweight, which is a huge plus during long work hours. It doesn't feel heavy or cumbersome, and the fabric is soft enough to be worn comfortably throughout the day.  3. **Durability**: The stitching and overall construction of the shirt seem very durable. After several washes, it has retained its shape and integrity, which is crucial for any workwear.  4. **Design and Fit**: The shirt has a decent fit—not too tight, not too loose. It provides enough room for movement without feeling baggy. The buttons and pockets are well-placed and functional.  **Cons:**  1. **Breathability**: While the shirt is lightweight, it could use better breathability. I found myself getting quite warm during intense work sessions, especially in a hot environment. It would be great if there were more ventilated areas or moisture-wicking properties.  Overall, the BOCOMAL FR Shirt is a solid choice for anyone in need of reliable flame-resistant workwear. It strikes a good balance between protection and comfort, making it a worthwhile investment for welders and other professionals in similar fields. With a few minor improvements, it could easily become a 5-star product.",7
