I have soaked them in Epsom salts. I have washed them repeatedly, in  fabric softener. Nothing works. They are hard as a rock! And utterly unbending. If you work in construction, maybe this is what you want? But if you’re just looking to purchase a pair of pants to wear casually, nostalgic of your teenage years in the 1970s… do not buy these! Horrible! I bought a 34 waist by 32 length. 34 waist in men’s pants usually fit me very loosely. Carpenter pants are not supposed to be snug. They are supposed to slouch loosely lower around your hips. I can barely button  the waist line, and it sits above the belly button. WORST  PANTS  EVER!",
