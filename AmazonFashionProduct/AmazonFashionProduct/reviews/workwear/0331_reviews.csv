This jacket is fine for casual wear with jeans or could wear with casual chino pants.  The one thing that I would give a not so good rating is that the zipper is one the left side which is usually the side for a female’s jacket.

I first ordered a solid color type of this sort of jacket a few years ago and ended up wearing it all the time. I was thinking about reproaching that sort of jacket again, because the well won one is now wearing down a bit too much. That's ok, because bomber jackets are meant for casual wear, which for me is often the go- to jacket choice. I did however want to try that kind of coat with a different type of material. After browsing around online for this sort of alternative; i came across this interesting take on that kind of design and am happy with this choice. This is what i would refer to as a super casual jacket. I say that because the material is a very soft polyester with a little bit of elastane. That makeup of the material sends this almost into a sweat suit category, but because of he thickness and the texture pattern, it uniquely keeps the jacket title. The signature bomber style arm pockets are present, which i love. Those arm pockets with the slim fitting way they are structured is what i love about this sort of fashion idea. When i am wearing this i feel like i am honoring aviation, but with it being a branch off from the old style leather variation, its more like an updated way to to that. The squared off sections of lines that give off a geometric shape within shapes effect is interesting. I like the small but effective detail around the collar, in the form of a white stripe. That little change of color away from the main blue color is noticeable and agreeable with me. The price of this makes is affordable and also a winner in every way. I recommend this because its the kind of jacket that can appeal to many personality types.",

Definitely loses one star right there. I actually like the textured pattern better in the pics than I do in person. It's not bad but, I don't know, not great either. The material is soft and has the weight of a light sweatshirt, so it's kind of a zip it over a t shirt on a cool day or evening, shirt/jacket. The wine red color is rich, not too bright and looks good. Sizing is where it should be, and that's always a plus. The little zipper pocket on sleeve is more for aesthetics but it does open and close, if you wanted to use it. The collar tag is a little bothersome and I might have to snip that off.

It says light weight jacket though I'd consider it closer to a medium weight jacket as to me it feels heavier than a sweatshirt.  The zipper pocket on the arm is nice.  The side pockets are roomy though I wish they had zippers.  Then again that might detract from the dressier look.  The two inside pockets are huge.  Probably good for putting a scarf or hat in but have very big openings such that you may have to worry about something falling out.  There were a few loose threads including a thread that was stitched front to back on the side pocket that had to be cut to access the pocket.  Otherwise, the jacket seems well made.The only quirk I've found with it is that it has a left side zipper pull.  I'm used to having a zipper pull on the right hand side.  The left hand zipper is typically associated with women's clothing, at least in the U.S.  Not an unbearable configuration to me but be aware in case it would bother you.As a side note, my wife commented how great the jacket looks on me.  Not sure if it is the textured material or the fact that I tend not to wear anything remotely fashionable or stylish.",2
