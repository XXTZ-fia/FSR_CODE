I'm 4""11, 137lbs and carry most of my weight in my hip and thigh area (waist 28.7"", hip 42"", thigh 23"" circumference). I initially ordered a size petite small, but couldn't get them over my thighs. Then I tried petite medium (pictured above) and they worked. These pants seem to have a more narrow cut in the posterior/upper thigh area, while still allowing for a roomy fit in the thigh area. You can see they are still somewhat loose in the waist. I remedied this by adding a drawstring.  I was worried about the pants being too thin, but ""overexposure"" wasn't a problem when I wore them--I guess since my butt & thighs don't radiate light. Actually, I appreciated the weight of the material since it helped me stay cool. All in all, this was a reasonable option for me being in between 2 sizes in the other styles.",2
