I have none so it’s a little extra baggy. And the pants ughhhhhh it has the stupid elastic band around the belly that cuts into you. My friend got the same pair and said the same thing. The band around the pants are too tight. Length is good. It’s the stupid band & bc of that I’m giving it a 3 star  Ps tried cutting the elastic band - didn’t work,

After 8mo holes formed. Not acceptable for me and will not get again.  I wash warm with non abrasive chemical free detergent and med heat dry for 30-45 min. My other brands of scrubs generally last 3 years.  Side note: these look like genie pants around the ankle.  Update: The XL fits better and they definitely shrunk a bit after wash and dry. So since all my scrubs have been a L I'd say these run a little small or are very fit forming. I would have liked better separate XL pant and L top. 5'6"" short torso, 170lbs, 40C bust. I ended up cutting the x in the front. Looked odd and loose on me. Did soften up after a couple wash and wears.  Original review: It's impossible to find 100% cotton these days, especially in the jogger pants and more flattering tops. I hate poly... it's hot and stiff. I thought since this has rayon (still a plastic fabric) it would be softer. Meh. I usually wear L in scrubs but these feel too snug for me. Particularly the buttocks... they make me feel like I have a big rear lol which I don't. I'm going to order an XL and compare. But I dislike the feel of the fabric on my skin as of now.",
