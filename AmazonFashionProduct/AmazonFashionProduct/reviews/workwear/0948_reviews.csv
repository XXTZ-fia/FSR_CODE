Krzysztof Jarosz,"No tumble dry, Big & Tall collar and sleeve sizes",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QUY821MJXC7M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D3ZBV83W,"2.0 "," the United States "," December 13, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: A-light Grey,Verified Purchase,"I am lowering the rating due to an incorrect description in the order details and no mention in the general descriptions that the care requires hang drying. I would not have bought them if I knew it.  Details: I bought three colors of style A, the same size XL.  The description on the main page does not differentiate them but in my order details, I got three different descriptions (the emphasis of discrepant descriptions is mine): the ""A-dark Teal Blue"" was described as ""SWISSWELL Men's Long Sleeve Shirts Polos Solid Colors Golf **T-Shirt** Tennis Casual Polo Shirts for Men Work XL,"" - it's not a T-shirt (and no color selection is given); the light gray as ""SWISSWELL Long Sleeve Polo Shirts for Men Moisture Wicking Golf Shirts Performance Mens Athletic **T Shirt** Light Grey XL,"" - it's not a T-shirt; and the navy blue as ""SWISSWELL Long Sleeve Polo Men Moisture Wicking Golf Shirts **Slim Fit** Polyester Collar Shirts Navy XL."" I was concerned about the ""Slim Fit"" part in the navy blue but all three turned out to be the same size style and cut.  The dark ones look great, but the light gray looks much worse - the texture of the fabric shows as more casual, not as smooth. They all are somewhat wrinkled straight from the package. The care instructions state they are machine washable but not to be tumbled, only hung to dry, so it's a pain. I assume it is because of the elastane content.  The sleeves are long: 37"" from the mid-neck (this is the equivalent of a dress shirt sleeve length). The collar is 20.5"" around, so it's wide. These are Big and Tall measurements. I cannot comprehend why there are no options for shorter sleeves and a shorter torso. Short men do not look good in shirts that are too long. These shirts have special trimming of a different color at the side splits, so shortening the body is a headache.",
