Alena Cooper,"Gorgeous and well made, but didn’t fit me.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKQIWROVF66AB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS3YN1S5,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 3, 2025",Size: SmallColor: Brown Sugar,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely 100% loved this blazer. I so wanted to keep it because it was classy and elegant but allowed for so much movement and flexibility so it was somehow structured but stretchy and so so comfortable! Material was awesome, breathable but not too thin, color was vibrant, construction/sewing was beautiful. Unfortunately the color I wanted was only available in a small and I am pretty much an xs in everything but sometimes I can make a small work for me. This was not the type of clothing I could do that with. It’s supposed to be a bit more form fitting- not like excessively so but the cut and back seams are made to look more tailored and so, on me, it just looked like it wasn’t my size. And it wasn’t. However I think the xs would have been perfect- form fitting but not constricting. I believe the size chart is accurate and that it fits true to size. I wouldn’t recommend sizing up for a loose fit because it would probably look sloppy. I’m not taking any stars off because this is a 5 star product and if the color I wanted becomes available in my size I would 100% but again. For the price point this blazer is awesome and I would recommend it, if your size is available.",
