I ordered extra wide waste because I might be wearing over something else sometimes, and for around home I don't need a perfect fit.But the thing is made for someone quite a bit taller than my 6 foot.  And.... I don't know if there is a way to design the suspenders to hold a shortening adjustment, but it was hard to adjust them and get them to hold the shorter suspender length.. Don't want to do it by sewing.... Seem to be holding now, after a couple washings, but.... Suggestion?",3

They were damaged.  Also, I did not like the extra heavy material. Some may like thick , heavy fabric, depending on what work or climate you will be wearing them, I prefer lightweight, durable material that I can move freely as I go about my chores in the yard and shed.  I received a refund , and a second pair , no charge!!! Absolute top notch customer service!  The replacement pair are dark indigo. After first wash , I am completely pleased with the quality and fit, and price is comparable, if not better than leading brands  The shoulder straps didn’t shrivel up, and remained flat…now if I could get bacon to do same. The denim is thick, but not terribly heavy, I could imagine wearing these for 10 years.",7

I returned the first pair I ordered for a replacement pair. The delivery was quick and contained a pair that fit perfect! The tags were attached and everything was in order. These Overalls are made of strong material and are very durable. The company gave me a quick refund for the first pair. I will be back to buy more and will probably be buying some of their other products as well.  Original 2-star review: Length and waist were perfect. Chest and back were tight! After inspectiont these look like they were someone else's return. Labels are attached to snaps. I'm not sure they are supposed to be that way. I also found a stain/ spot on the leg of the overalls. I'm returning for a slightly bigger size. I sure hope the new pair is actually new!,
