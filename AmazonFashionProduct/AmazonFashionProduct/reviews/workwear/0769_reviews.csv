I have tried a handful or brands and I was pretty loyal to figs for years due to the fit on my short but chunky body. After a little recent weight gain and being between figs sizes in addition to them having zero stretch, I needed to try something else. A coworker suggested these pants for the stretchy material and boy was he so right! I looove them. I might stick with just black for now since that’s the most flattering on me but wow! Amazing scrub pants!  They are a little baggy which I love at work but most girls tend to like slim fit and showing every curve so just something to consider if you’re one of those girls.(I’ll update with pics next time I wear them)",9
