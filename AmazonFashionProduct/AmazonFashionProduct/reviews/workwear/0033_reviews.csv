Kaitlin_KS,Not petite in larger sizes.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NCMLTF12SBHJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095PRJX4W,"3.0 "," the United States "," August 11, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"Reading reviews it seems those of us who bought larger sizes are finding these too long. The center back length on the size small is supposedly 24” according to the description. I sized up to an XL to encompass my arm muscles and DDDs…the top is a nice material, but still doesn’t add a ton of xtra shoulder space (feels constricting when I give myself a hug). I’d keep them except it is FAR longer than the description; 28” shoulder to tail. Typically larger sizes in petites goes up only a very small amount in length: 1/2 inch or an inch maybe. I expect these tags were incorrectly placed on regular length shirts. While the tag on this top says XLP, the shirt says XL. Amazon problems…",
Michelle Miranda,Great fit if you’re a little short waisted,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12YKNCI2NA9Z0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095PRJX4W,"5.0 "," the United States "," June 7, 2023",Size: Small PetiteColor: Navy,Verified Purchase,"I am not petite, I’m 5’5”, but I am short waisted so this top hits at a good length for me.

Crys,Nearly the same as WW710,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17H35VEI7CHIL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B095PRJX4W,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 4, 2022",Size: Large PetiteColor: Black,Verified Purchase,"I don’t know about this top being sized / considered “Petite” as it is described here. It seems to fit as a regular scrub top and the tags and label just say “L” for Large, so not “LP.” I am a shorty, but generally don’t require petite cut tops as I have a large bust and longer torso for my height. True to size beyond the listing description.  I had previously purchased the Cherokee WW Revolution style top in WW710 cut, and this is almost the same. The tunic pocket loops are reversed, and the other style has a slight vent on the straight cut bottom. I wasn’t a fan of the 710 as it felt to be a bit restrictive across my bust, flattening, and the shoulders would ride up, despite the rest of the fit feeling appropriately. Obviously just not for a curvy girl. This 612 style seems to have resolved that, as it feels like it has a more appropriate cut for a larger chest to waist ratio. The vertical front panel seams actually fall perfect in a very flattering way.  The fabric is smooth and soft, why I continue to stick with the Revolution line. I have to wear black for work, and it’s not a lint magnet either. Stays clean and professional looking. No ironing needed, light but not too blousy. I also swing between super hot / sweaty and freezing during a shift, and this offers the best of both warmth and ventilation for the best temper’s controlling fabric I’ve found in scrubs.  I’m extremely happy with this one, and plan to buy more.",4
