Most carpenter/construction pants have extra room for kneeling or squatting and these are no exception.  There is ample room without the pants being too bulky or baggy.  Working in a crawlspace or maneuvering in tight areas has been no problem in these.  Definitely recommend if you're active and need tough pants.  Not sure if the material being softer is going to affect their lifespan but I will update the review in a few months.  The only issue I notice is the front ""normal"" pockets aren't as deep as a regular pair of Wrangler or other brand jeans.  The extra construction pockets are deep enough for small tools but the top front won't really hold a modern smart phone.  The pocket lower on the right leg will hold a phone though.",

For example, the fabric is still relatively thin, there's no gusset at the crotch, and the seams are sewn well but not necessarily designed to withstand heavy work. In short, they are not built like Duluth pants. They are built like GAP pants, but *styled* like carpenter pants.  That's fine, of course. You can wear carpenter pants casually and appreciate the value of the extra pocket and the hammer loop, even if you're not planning to wear these on a job site.  Also, I have large thighs, and these fit me comfortably. I appreciate the relaxed fit!  If you're into nicely designed, relaxed fitting pants that look like carpenter pants (but aren't necessarily built for heavy labor), then I think this works really well.",2
karthic,One of my favorite pants,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21K5GGA3VXZB5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XR3BWR9,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 17, 2023",,,"At first, the pants seem very thick; but trust me, you quickly get used to it and it makes other pants feel cheap. Other than the occasional small loose thread, I haven't had any rips or tears over my months of use. The fit is a pretty perfect bridge between baggy and straight and it helps to even out my broad upper body. At 6'2"", the 30"" pair has to sit fairly low on my waist to fit around my ankles properly and the 32"" pair can do so right below my navel",

I like the overall color and look of these pants. They are sewn well, no loose or frayed threads.  The front pockets are short and shallow, my cell phone barely fits and stuff easily falls out of the pockets when I’m seated. The lining of the front pockets is bright white and this shows slightly while wearing the pants detracting from their look. The rear pants pockets are fine.",
Mr. S.,great fit. maybe iron it. very good design and stiching.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVFNXU1CPNG32/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XR3BWR9,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 16, 2023",,,"It's Gap so you know it's gonna be decent design and stiching. The fit is perfect. The fabric is not rough so you won't chafe any skin. The color is also pleasant, vibrant with out being gaudy or bland. I wore it right out the box and obviously it's all wrinkled - but a quick wash and iron and it'll be part of the rotation of path I wear to the office. Very pleased with these pants.",

The pants have numerous deep pockets and the fabric is soft, but durable. He wears a size 38X30 and these had a perfect relaxed fit. The button closure was a bit difficult for him because he has arthritis in his fingers. These will be great for doing outdoor chores.",

Roger Bryant,Standard carpenter pant style. Loose fit.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U2PKDEQ99R4M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09XR3BWR9,"4.0 "," the United States "," February 15, 2023",Size: 40W x 32LColor: Moonstone,,"These are pretty standard carpenter pants as far as the design. There is a hammer loop and a couple small side pockets for pencils & measuring tools. The fabric is similar to typical khaki pants. These are not as rugged as other carpenter pants I own. It seems like these are made more for the popular look than for functionality. In my opinion carpenter pants should be made of a more rugged fabric with reinforced knees. Something like duck canvas. These are not. If you like the look of carpenter pants but are not a carpenter then these pants would serve you well. If you plan to work in these, I wouldn't, unless it just for some light painting or something like that. They do look good and fit well. They seem to be a loose fit so the legs are wider than normal and taper slightly toward the ankles.  They fit perfect around the waist. To sum up this review, these do look good and they're very comfortable. Paired with some timbs, a button down shirt and a fitted cap, these would be perfect. Feel free to buy them if you like this style, but I personally wouldn't buy these for hard work situations.",2
