Amazon Customer,Horrible,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35VPEJMU51O7F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BMV84HD3,"1.0 "," the United States "," August 5, 2024",,Verified Purchase,If I could I’ve give this zero stars. I’m very disappointed. I ordered this for my son for a photo shoot as we’re all are wearing blue overalls for this  shoot and was very disappointed when I saw it. It doesn’t even look like the picture shown here at all. I don’t even have enough time to get another one. It’s looks more like sky blue than regular blue jean overalls. The clips aren’t even attached to the strap. As I side I’m VERY DISAPPOINTED.,
Seri Stinson-Meyer,Straps fall down,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Y5XH0ECAHITD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BMV84HD3,"3.0 "," the United States "," June 26, 2024",,Verified Purchase,Had to order new clasps because the ones it comes with are loose.

Cedric,Comfortable but terrible hardware and unwearable after 2 minutes,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZS7EL8PQ4O65/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BMV84HD3,"2.0 "," the United States "," October 30, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"Are they cheap? Yes Do they fit? Yes That’s the extent of the positives. The front flap comes up very low. Definitely lower than shown on the model. The hardware is horrendous. The clasps on the overall straps aren’t even one piece. To secure themselves on the button it uses a tiny small piece of metal, which, when given any resistance, pops off. Leaving you strapless and hunting for the now missing tab somewhere on the ground. This happened while only fitting them on after removing them from the packaging. After figuring a way to permanently attach the straps (with zip ties) I had one of the buttons snap off and break in half after 2 minutes of usage. I attached the straps via safety pins to get me home, if not I’d have to hold my pans up all night. If you fall in love with them, plan on spending some money on getting better hardware that won’t break. Which after time and money, you just might be better off buying a higher quality pair in the first place.  I’ll be returning mine.",

SheriB,They tried but buttons are necessary on overalls too,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34BU0GOREE18Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BMV84HD3,"3.0 "," the United States "," September 26, 2023",,Verified Purchase,"The material is nice, seems sturdy.  The only problem was they weren’t finished…the buttons were missing and the hooks were in a separate bag.  I could figure out how to put on the hooks if the buttons for overalls were just sewn on, they are heavy duty and these were completely missing.  My son decided he’d figure out how to use them, and at the price we decided to keep.",

I'm skinny. I can't say how it fit around my waist because I couldn't get it over my thighs. Also, even though I couldn't pull these up to my waist, the leg length was already too short. They're obviously made for 8 year old boys, not adults.  Also, not accustomed to having to assemble my clothes.",
