mog703,Not as hefty as the Gilden Tee Shirts,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DG5ED52X0GQN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07P2XV2MK,"3.0 "," the United States "," January 7, 2025",Size: X-LargeColor: Safety Orange,Verified Purchase,"Even though this is classified as work shirt I say its just another tee shirt. I have been buying the Gilden shirts for years and wanted to compare. Gilden does have a lot of ""models"" but even their cheapest ranks better than these. That being said, even on sale, these are more expensive. I would not buy these again. Nothing wrong with them but they don't meet up to the Gilden's in any way from fit to comfort. I work in construction and wear tee shirts daily so i want a shirt that can go through the wash time after time. Obviously, its a preference thing but i don't recommend these. I really never hear much comment on Gilden but I say it is the best value out there from sweatshirts to jogging pants. Not that this is a great brand name but sometimes you pay a little more and get a little less when you go with a household name in clothing. Check out the Gilden shirts here and give it a shot. I am sure you will feel the same way I do.",

I like the poly/cotton blend. 100 percent cotton become soaked messes and 100 percent poly makes me stink to high heaven. They do retain dirt stains after washing, especially around the neck. But every brand of work shirt I’ve worn does the same. Besides, if you work in landscaping or construction and you’re bothered by this, you should probably find a new line of work.

The sleeve will probably depart the rest of the shirt the next laundry cycle. They may be inexpensive but that’s probably because Hanes doesn’t expect them to last more than a month and a half.
