He likes the Carpenter style so I saw these and figured a slight change in style would do him good! I usually order him the regular carpenter pants but decided to try the straight-fit carpenter pants to my chagrin. He got them for Christmas and they lasted just two months. While working, he crouched down and the entire crotch region ripped right out of them. Though I found it hilarious, he was not stoked to wrap the nether regions of the pants in duct tape to finish his shift. I realized the material was quite a bit thinner than the other ones I ordered for him...a lot thinner. I would never think that changing from regular to straight-leg would mean cheaper quality, but alas it has. If you are looking for sturdy work carpenter jeans, forgo these and order the regular Dickies....NOT the straight-fit, unless you want to duct tape the crotch of your pants closed while working.",

They take a lickin' and keep on kickin.'  Lately I have noticed that many manufacturers of work wear (especially those who outsourced aggressively) are using thinner less expensive material that wears out much sooner than my old ""work wear"" clothing. Unfortunately these jeans seem to be products of the aggressive outsourcing strategy that relies on brand name to justify price point.
