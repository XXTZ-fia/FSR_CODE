It is so comfortable and looks really good. My one drawback is I wish the collar stood up a little more. But that's easy to fix by taking it to a tailor shop. It is well worth the money. And I heard other people say that it was sheer but I did not find it that way at all. Would definitely recommend to other people (I bought the white blouse with black polka dots),
