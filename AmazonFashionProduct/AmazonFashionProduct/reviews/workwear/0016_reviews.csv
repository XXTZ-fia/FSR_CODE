El envío fue excelente, con tiempos rápidos y un buen embalaje que protegió perfectamente los productos. Eligió la talla S para la blusa, y aunque quedó bastante bien, estaba un poco ajustada en el busto. Al ver las medidas de la talla adicional podría resultar ser demasiado suelta y ancha, por lo que opté por la talla S y hacer un pequeño ajuste en la parte superior con un sastre quedando excelente. La tela de la blusa es de excelente calidad, tal como se describe en la página, e incluso superó nuestras expectativas. Definitivamente un 10 de 10, y muy contentos con la compra. ¡Recomendada ya que se ahorran dinero versus el almacén presencial y se consiguen en color blanco!",

The top fit ok but tight at the chest, with no stretch. The rest of the shirt was almost baggy everywhere else.  The bottoms were too long for me. They dragged on the floor, even with tennis shoes on. The waistband is supposed to be adjustable but even tied as tight as I could tie it, they were falling down all day. A smaller size would have been too small for my thighs.  Not happy with the sizing and comfort. They also feel like they are cheaply made.",

The shape is very cute and flattering with the faux wrap. I wish it had more/better pockets but they get the job done. I am 5’4 around 170 lb and I got a large because I prefer my scrubs to be more roomy. I did deduct a star because it is not stretchy.  There’s a tiny bit of stretch, but I was looking for a stretchy material so I was pretty disappointed in that as it was advertised as two way stretch.  However it’s still pretty comfortable, the material is a little stiff but I think once I wear it more it’ll be better. Overall recommend!",

I love the color and the material is nice but they just don’t fit right. I’m 5’3” and 200 pounds. Both the shirt and the pants (which are both Cherokee but I purchased separately) are snug in some places and bagging others. Not to mention they’re both too long. My hunch is that they are made for someone taller and would probably fit you if you’re not a Shorty like me.  🤷‍♀️,2
