Due to my weird feet, the safety toe models are uncomfortable after long days. OTOH, the soft toe models in Wide are very comfortable. I got the black pair so I could ride my motorcycle and not have the dreaded black shifter toe at work. The sole of the black pair is heavier and has a more aggressive traction design, which interferes with shifting gears. The wheat pair has a less aggressive sole, but still catches on motocross style foot pegs. The black pair I ordered in Wide, seemed to be slightly narrower on my right foot. Still noticeable after 2 weeks. Otherwise, still great feel and looks more professional at work.",

You name it, I have probably owned it. I'm originally from NYC, and in NYC, owning Timberland boots is a fashion must. That being said, I have not bought Timberland boots since the early 2000s, and they weren't for work purposes, but I bought them for work. I work 5 days a week 16-hour shifts, and these boots are comfortable, look good, and are definitely waterproof. My feet do not hurt at the end of the day the soles are thick and will not wear down anytime soon. The traction is good, giving me more confidence about where and what I may step into, like dirt, spills, oil, or whatever I encounter. I like these boots so much that I bought a second pair. This is my experience, so yours may vary, but you can buy these for your everyday wardrobe or what they are intended for, which is work. They look good, and you may be comfortable all day (I'm not you), but they are worth trying. These are replacements for another brand that claimed everything, but they did not last a year on my feet. The boots lasted 8 months and went into the garbage.",4

The toe inserts were missing, the laces were open without the new shoe lace tie, laced all the way up and the box inside the delivery plastic was torn. The toe cap telegraphs through the leather. The left boot sole makes a popping noise when you walk. With all of this being said, I needed boots pretty bad so I put them on and went to work. I will deal with this popping noise until it goes away from working in them but if not I will get another pair within the month. I’m not ordering from the same company next time which is a shame because once I find a good company it’s my go to. Amazon did a good job delivering the boots like they usually do.",
