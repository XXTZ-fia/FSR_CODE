This particular shirt can be worn both closed and buttoned up and also open with another shirt showing underneath. It looks good and feels even better. One thing to note, is that the shirt is a bit thicker and heavier than other materials so plan out your outfit accordingly.",

If $25 for what you're hoping is a nice shirt jacket sounds too good to be true, that's cause it is.

The fabric used is a linen cotton mix, and feels mostly similar to 100% linen. This shirt jacket is best for spring and summer, because it is light weight. I wear mine with a T shirt underneath, and I get lots of complements on how I look.  This jacket washes well, with minimal shrinking and or fading. COOFANDY does a great job of making sure the seems are sewn well, and the buttons are fastened correctly. This is a great value for a spring/summer light shirt/jacket, with a vintage look.",8
