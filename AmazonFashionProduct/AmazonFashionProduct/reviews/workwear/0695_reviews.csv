I have attempted to contact Carhartt's corporate office on numerous occasions to have them send me double front unhemmed. They have refused every time. Honestly it sucks. But over the years I have found that if I buy the 36L WASHED, that overtime they won't shrink as much as the firm ones. That being said it's great that I've learned how to wash and dry these badass pants over the years to maintain just the right amount of length for my preference. Every pair of double knee Carhartt pants that I have ever owned have lasted and outlasted every other pair of pants. I just started a new concrete job after 25 years of logging. I tried to put on my double fronts from last year and realized that I gained weight so I had to buy something bigger. Those pants are 12 years old. These pants, well, we'll see.

In my line of work, there is no point in wearing a clean set of pants daily because it's guaranteed they will be dirty by the end of the day. So, I rotate two pairs, wearing each for three days, then wash them on Sunday. Two pairs will get me through the spring and summer seasons. Then, I switch to insulated waders during the fall and winter. After a season, usually one of the pairs is still wearable, and I save those for backups or other jobs around the house. I'm on my knees a lot, and the double layers come in clutch, increasing the longevity twofold. Personally, I love wearing waders, but it's just too hot during the warmer months, and these pants are the closest thing to the protection waders give me. In conclusion, I highly recommend these pants and also suggest rotating a few pairs. Wearing the same pair every day, like I used to, will result in them getting destroyed, no matter the quality.",

They’re made of a pretty thick and durable material, the most common issue I’ve had with other work pants is over time I get huge holes over my knees from kneeling on rough surfaces like OSB,cement and gravel, so far that issue has been solved by these pants having and additional layer of material firmly attached on the front of the pants starting from just below the hip and running down well below the knee. However as great as these pants are they have an achilles heel… the zipper. my last two or so pairs of these pants have been retired after about 6 months due to the zipper breaking and leaving the fly permanently open which as I’m sure you can imagine leaves you open to a lot of unpleasant remarks on a construction site (as well as an unwelcome cold draft)",

If I had thunder thighs these might have worked but nope unfortunately non returnable so to the goodwill they went. I do know the quality of Carhart has went down drastically since they started to cater to the hipsters who never would use the clothing as intended.
