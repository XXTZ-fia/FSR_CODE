Amazon Customer,"It's not just clothing, It's a great investment.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RHBA64CXQS6N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09K6QX85K,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 15, 2025",Size: 12 LongColor: Heathered Black Denim,Verified Purchase,"I love these bibs! They fit where they need to and they are durable with out being stiff. Pockets for all of my tools when I'm working and no need for a purse in public! I will be buying more!  ** try them on before washing and READ the instructions for washing**  I say that because I did NOT do this when I bought Dovetails jeans. The jeans were a little tight but I washed them anyway planning to keep them, I ended up shrinking them. I learned 2 things with these bibs: 1. This brand is made for function and comfort not style, so go up in size. I'm a size 8 in most women's jeans, with this brand I wear a 12 and I would rather wear bibs everyday now. 2. Low heat or hang drying will make a huge difference in durability.  If you're still reading and on the fence... I have done a lot of odd jobs over the years. I wore these bibs 3 days straight after a flood hit my neighbors house and I had a zero problems gutting the house with these on. - Sheet rock dust and putty came right off, -Knee pads fit well, -Tools fit in every pocket and stayed, no tears, no wear, no fading, no fraying. - No shoulder pain from the suspenders when I bent down and no ride ups. I would have ripped my regular jeans, wore out the knee, had dust caked to me and been pulling up my pants every 20 seconds... Its worth every penny.",

I usually wear a size 8 and I don't like pants that hit at my ankles so I ordered an 8 Long. The length was Perfect!! The size 8 was just a little too snug for my taste, especially around the waist and hips. Here's what I thought was great: the pockets! And the material was heavier duty- not some thin flimsy fabric that would tear easily. Another win- it stretches when you bend and squat! Now to wait for a 10 Long to be in stock.... But then I'm definitely ordering them!",

I have consistently been wearing carhartt for the last 10+ years and haven’t really had too many complaints other than variety. Upon trying these on I found that the only thing that was great about them was the length of the legs and the thickness. I ordered a size 2 extra long which is a small in the women’s carhartt bibs and what the size chart chart suggested. For an extra long they still went up my butt, the legs were long but the torso was not. The top part of the bibs was like a thong for my boobs. It was almost half the width of my carhartt bibs, and I do not have big boobs I’m a 36 C so when I would try to bend over it would cover one boob, or be in between my boobs. The pockets on the back were super high up and looked weird. These were too tight so when I decided to return them and size up I noticed that when you go from size 2 to size 4 the price increases drastically. I just ended up sending them back and will prefer a new pair of carhartt bibs. Super disappointing as I was looking forward to these because of all the hype they were getting. For reference I’m 5’8 and 140 lbs. so not even super tall.",

They are super comfy and stretchy and contour to my body without fitting tight or baggy while still feeling feminine in them. I actually feel strangely sexy in them too...haha!  The material is premium quality, for sure! I bended, squatted, and twisted every which way possible with easy and comfort.  They were delivered just in time my next project, 2 days early, even.

I wish I wore them around doing work like activities without doing anything that could get them dirty (ie painting) that wouldn’t allow for me to return them.  They are extremely tight in the hips and limit movement but when I went a size up the top was super super loose and just got in the way. I wear DDD bra too so I can’t imagine how loose it is on people with a smaller chest.  I usually wear a size 27 jeans and got the 4/30 on these. I do workout and have somewhat of a booty (I know you can’t tell from these photos bc the overalls are squeezing too tight). And it also is very tight on the tummy giving the illusion of a FUPA. It’s just disappointing because these are really expensive.  There is also no utility loop for a hammer but there are lots (somewhat too many) of pockets.  I tried to like them and give money to small business but I’m very disappointed and going to have to get a pair of carhartts.,

They have more stretch- or I should say they have stretch. They aren’t the classic workwear duck material. I’ll likely wear these in public more then my Duluths. For really nasty chores and winter work it’s still my duluth firehose overalls. These are really nice and comfortable though and will wear them all the time for lighter duty stuff. Love them. Also women owned and made for women. Love the diversity of their models. Love the brand and support them.,

I was excited to try these since I’ve heard so many good things about Dovetail. I’m 5’8” with a long torso, 155lb with most of that weight in my hips. I originally ordered a size 10 and it was uncomfortably  fitted. Then I ordered a 12 which honestly doesn’t feel a whole lot different. I actually had to use a measuring tape to confirm they were  different sizes. The 12 gives me a *little* more room in the hips. I can squat down without too much restriction. But they’re still really fitted, and I’m not sure how I feel about it.  There’s definitely not enough room to wear leggings underneath. The 12 gives me PLENTY of length in the straps, though… I have to shorten them significantly. Unfortunately the 14 is not currently not available.It’s a weird conundrum, I assumed this brand would have a more generous cut in the hip/butt area. The quality seems great and I love the zip pocket on the leg. But I’m not sure these are the ones for me.",

There is still a little excess material in the back but roomier is better than too tight. I still don't know why the smaller sizes aren't available. Is it because they aren't even offered in sizes smaller than size 2 or is it because the demand is so high that they sell out as soon as they are offered? I settled for size 2 short.

I read countless reviews to try and pick my correct size to avoid a return. I'm 5'4"" and 130lbs and I went with a size 4, 30 inseam. They fit beautifully and held up for the crazy jobs I had to tackle. Because of the stretch factor, they did loosen up but that will be great for layering! Even though they aren't insulated, they're surprisingly warm! I'm writing all the things I seeked in reviews to help you decide to buy and try! Price was my first main concern, but when you have the support necessary to get the job done comfortably and efficiently, the price no longer matters.",
katiego,Perfect overalls,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUVFKTS1H7WUY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09K6QX85K,"5.0 "," the United States "," February 6, 2022",Size: 8Color: Grey Canvas,Verified Purchase,"I work at a nursery so bending over, getting wet and avoiding thorns is a regular practice. A customer saw me wearing a pair of Levi's overalls and she couldn't recommend enough the pair of Dovetail overalls she was wearing. I was so excited to finally find a good recommendation--they fit a female body, move with you, are thick without being heavy or cumbersome, and a good cold wind doesn't go through them, and neither do thorns! The elastic in the straps really makes a difference for comfort and ease, and I dread the day that the elastic wears out -- but the customer had worn hers for years, so here's hoping that they last forever! I'm so glad I finally found a brand of overalls worth the investment. I ordered my exact size and it's comfortable, enough room to wear leggings underneath.",

But, I finally decided to treat myself and I’m very glad I did. These fit better than any other overalls I have and I love the selection of pockets. The fabric is sturdy but not stiff- it has a good amount of stretchiness. I have interstitial cystitis, so having clothing I can wear which doesn’t put pressure on my bladder is important. These overalls allow me to be comfortable, while looking a bit more put-together than sweatpants do. I’m probably going to be ordering a pair in another color soon!",3

Not sure why they offer different types of sizing if they will be sent in standard 2,4, 6, etc. Maybe would have helped me in ordering the size or maybe the wrong size was sent to me? I can tell they are wonderful though the material seems really sturdy and the leg opening is perfect . Wish these had fit. I'm going to reorder and see if I can get the right size.",

I returned and I decided to go with a 12 and I think the fit is perfect for me -just a little loose. I love that these are in long lengths like 34.
