The waist part that has a elastic band was up over my stomach (I don't wear pants that way) and when I tried to raise my hands over my head well let's just say the crotch area had no room and I couldn't get my hands completely over my head. I got them today and test fit and started the return. I really wish they made 4x or 5x I think if this is what they consider 3x I probably need a 5x in their sizes. It kind of saddens me because I was really looking forward to getting these, the last pair I've had were Dickies and it was quite a while ago and I could put them on over my work boots and everything. Guess I will be looking for some of those. If you're not over 6 ft tall and over 250 they may fit you okay I mainly got these to crawl up under houses when I'm working on people's heat and air but I couldn't see trying to crawl in these being so tight.",4

They fit my XXXL frame (with some compromises like legs too long but hey, this isn't custom tailored haberdashery for the Met crowd). They do suffer but don't explode in the presence of a few paltry thousand degrees of hot weld splatter and they don't break the bank.  Are they worth it?  I just ordered two more pair.",4
