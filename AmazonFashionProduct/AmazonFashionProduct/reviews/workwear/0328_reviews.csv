I live in the San Francisco Bay Area (California). Our weather is unusually mild & moderate. Never too hot, never too cold. I cannot say if this pants are durable. That will take time to determine. That is why I took one star off for 4 stars. I used a measuring tape to determine my waist, hips, and inseam length. Amazon's webpage for Libin pants suggested size ""Large.""
