RMR Global Productions Inc,Actually 100% cotton very comfortable makes a nice shape lots of ACTUAL pockets,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DMM5EDD32BZQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BLXQX3RV,"5.0 "," the United States "," January 22, 2025",Size: 8Color: Rinsed Black,Verified Purchase,"Was looking everywhere for pants that are breathable and 100% cotton, love the fact that Dickies cared about making these for working women on duty, has lots of pockets, even make a nice behind!  Only thing you have to think about is cotton fades faster than any material, so yes, there is some fading that will happen. Try sticking to washing with blacks only, or get the woolite black detergent. If you really don’t wanna get rid of them, you could also throw them In some toxic free fabric die, eventually, down the road. This is not the manufacturers fault. This is simply because it’s 100% cotton, but keep In mind, is actually better for your body and healthier for a Woman to wear, especially, every single day.",

The seam across the rear pulls towards the left. I have submitted photos and a video. I purchased the Dickies carpenter pants for landscaping and home repair. I am reaching out to request a credit or discount. It's not good for the environment to send them back as a return and end up on a shelf or in a bag. As the pants can be serviceable.

The camo ""color"" is cute but as others have noted, for some odd reason, the ""phone"" pocket on stretch versions is on the right leg and positioned behind the cargo pocket reducing the usefulness of both.  I feel like the cargo pockets are also a little shorter, or at least the velcro is shorter.  I plan to add velcro to the top of the pocket so the flap secures easier and more securely when carrying my phone.  Unless you really need the stretch fabric, the 100% cotton version is more practical.  I still wish the fabric was thicker.Original:  I have these in several colors, all the 100% cotton versions (the ""rinsed"" ones--the non-rinsed colors are not 100% cotton).  The material is comfortable but somewhat thin.  I only use the flapped cargo pockets and the ""phone"" pocket--which is not large enough for my phone but works for a pen and 3x5 notepad (and is slightly in front of the cargo pocket), so I cannot comment on the usefulness of the other pockets.  The flapped cargo pockets barely fit my phone.  They are also positioned much too low to be comfortable long-term.I normally wear men's cargo pants which have huge pockets and thick material, but they are not ""dressy"" in the least.  I wanted something more sleek and classy for social events that allows me to carry a phone and small wallet, and these fit the bill.  As others have noted, the waistband is huge in the back.  I typically wear a belt, so that doesn't bother me too much.  The legs do flair a lot--they are not straight legged--but look fine with boots (also my normal footwear).  I feel like the rise is too high in front, and I have received a few pairs that are much too high.  So quality control isn't the best.  I've received pairs where the front rise is more than an inch higher than other pairs of the same size and color.These ""work"" for my needs, barely.  They are not work pants.  They are too thin and the pockets are small and poorly positioned.  But they are decent ""dress"" pants for someone who doesn't want to carry a purse.  But you will need a belt.",9
