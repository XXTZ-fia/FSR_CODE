Also, the pockets aren’t nearly as roomy as normal scrub tops and they’re slanted rather than square so forget about carrying the usual things nurses need in their pockets while in a hospital setting. The biggest advantage to the top is that patients don’t get to stare at your cleavage while you’re delivering care, so if your patients are anything like mine, you won’t mind foregoing the above mentioned conveniences if it means not dealing with handsy, inappropriate patients (especially if you’ve got a lot of patients with mental health issues, are on hard illegal drugs or just tend to be more aggressive)",2
