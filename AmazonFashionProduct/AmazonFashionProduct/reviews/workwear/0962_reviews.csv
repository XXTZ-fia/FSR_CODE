When I needed more scrubs for work I ""reordered"" the set that I had bought because they have been fantastic for what I wanted. They were comfortable and had the pockets, which I love, that I wanted.  The two I received, are not the same thing. As you can see from the photo the colors do not match, the lighter colored one is the NEW product. On the new product, the v-neck seam goes down to almost the pocket, which I do not like. The fabric doesn't feel the same either and seems cheap. Once I opened the package I saw the difference and thought that it was the lighting because it was lighter in color and is almost shiny. It wasn't the lighting.  I am returning the ""reorder"" and will be looking for different scrubs. If they are able to actually duplicate my original order, I am interested.",

The short sleeve is just about the right size, maybe a bit snug. The color is vibrant and holds fabric marker well. Only one small thread was loose in the seams. It's a tight weave so they don't breathe as much, but I expect that to get better over time and after several washes. Pockets on the shirt are great. No place to hang my badge.

I bought these scrubs to wear on the days that I see patients in the clinic.  I am 6'1"" and these scrub pants are too short for me.  The scrub pant pockets are not deep enough and items tend to fall out of your pocket when you sit. The material has a rough feel and they have to be ironed after being washed (throwing them in the dryer will not take care of the wrinkles)! The pant drawstring is flimsy so much and so that I broke the string on the first pair that I tried to tie. I was expecting a better quality product and I would have sent them back to the vendor for a refund but I have a tendency to wash/clean any item that I purchase before wearing, so by me washing the scrubs eliminated me from returning them!",
