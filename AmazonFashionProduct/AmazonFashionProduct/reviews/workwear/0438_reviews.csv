I have an average thin build, some curves, but not ""curvy."" Five foot five, 125 lbs, my Dickies men's size is 32 x 30 (same as for 874s, but that's a different review). These fit super loose (too loose to wear) when unpacked, I washed and dried them twice in hot water, and high heat, and they shrunk to the perfect fit. I cuff them once.  I get compliments on them all the time, and I wear them all the time. It's the best thirty-bucks you will ever spend, I have Banana Republic trousers in my closet at $150 that I pass over in lieu of these. I got the natural color (they are not ""yellow"" as some reviews have said). The fabric has a nice drape, but is thick enough to not be see through. I almost don't want to tell people about these pants in case they become more known an the price goes up. lol.  PS On these and my other Dickies, they are much improved by getting a ripper and taking the Dickies tag off of them. Sorry, Dickies, I'd rather people wonder where I got such cool pants.",6

I ordered in the “natural” color. I’m hard to fit and was a 32” waist pre-pandemic and Carhartt discontinued the carpenter pant I’ve been wearing for years so ordered a 32” Dickies that was too small so it lingered in the closet since 2020. I finally broke down a few weeks ago and ordered a 33” which was “large” right out of the package and was confident the new Dickies would fit. I washed them twice (it was stiff with “sizing” from the factory) and tried them on and was happy. However, I made the mistake of wearing them on a long flight and realized it was still too small after shrinking. I’ll have to buy a 34” waist….. I’ll end up with 3 pairs at that point; a too tight 32”, a seemingly snug fit 33” that I could wear as long as it’s not worn on a long airline flight or hours long car cruise, and perhaps a “loose fit” 34” needing a belt….. I don’t know, we’ll see. I really like wear these for all purpose, leisure to work around the house. The clock is ticking on my old Carhartt before they start to wear out…..",3
