This shirt definitely isn't 100% cotton and it feels like it's at least a polyester blend, but it's odd I couldn't find anything on the labels.

The material feels nice - I didn’t look to see what it’s made of but it has a slight stretch to it so I don’t think it’s 100% cotton which is fine. But anyway, nice shirt!",

The medium weight cotton fabric feels soft, this crew neck t-shirt is quite comfortable to wear. I’m glad that I chose the black color, the white font Caterpillar logo, with the yellow accent, has that classic CAT style and look. The other colors look nice too, but black, white, and yellow, are the colors that I most associate with Caterpillar.  It’s definitely a sharp looking CAT shirt. I love the classic look of the white font Caterpillar logo, with the yellow accent, set against the dark black background. It’s more of a slim fit, rather than a relaxed fit, as listed. Besides the slim fit, the sizing also seems to be slightly off.  The size XL fits more like a Large. I strongly recommend sizing up for a more relaxed fit, if desired. It’s rather tight in the neck, and very snug and form fitting throughout the torso. The length seems to be a tad bit short, but it’s adequate. The overall snugness of the fit is really more of a concern, especially since the 100% cotton material will likely shrink after washing. The snug fit may be flattering for some, so if you prefer a tighter, more form fitting t-shirt, you may want to order your normal size, otherwise, size up.  Aside from the snug fit, I’m very pleased with the quality and style of this sharp looking t-shirt. I’m hoping that the shrinkage will be minimal, especially if I wash it in cold water only, and dry it with low heat. It’s still very wearable, but I think that a size larger would have been a better fit for me. At $25, it’s a good value, an option certainly worth considering. Highly recommended!",

However, I noticed a discrepancy between the product details and the t-shirt I received. While the product description indicates it's made of 100% polyester, the t-shirt itself is labeled as 100% cotton. The fabric is reasonably soft and falls somewhere between being too thin for longevity and too thick to feel durable. The print quality is satisfactory. Yet to see how it fares after a wash.  In terms of fit, it runs a bit small. Typically, I wear size L for a good fit and XL for a relaxed fit. I opted for the XL in this case, and it fits more like a standard L-sized t-shirt.
