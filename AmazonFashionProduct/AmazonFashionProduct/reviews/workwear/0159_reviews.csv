He loved them, I purchased the color Steel ""Grey"".  The quality is very nice - the material is a thick material with a very nice cut.  Looks flattering with the high waist and pockets.  This can go well with something dressy like a sweater with nice boots or switch it up with a sneaker and sweatshirt.  Versatile and functional win, win, we will definitely get another color for my husband.",

My Amazon essentials cargo pants marked 36x30 fit great- even a bit loose. These just delivered cargo pants were marked 36x30. True sizing is probably 32x 30. Couldn’t even get the button within 2 inches of the buttonhole. So a big waste of money and why should I buy amazon clothing again? It’s not cheap (this was a deal day fake special pricing same as regular price) and I guess in Bangladesh they don’t care or perhaps the workers aren’t allowed time to do a proper job. Burned again Amazon. Well played. Jackasses.,

Unfortunately, whomever was creating the sizing for these had no idea what 'sizing' really is. Their 32 waist is more like a 28, I couldn't even close them. Also there's no way these are 30 long, more like 33 since they covered my feet like little pant versions of a straight jacket.  Really disappointing. I considered buying a larger size, but then I'd probably be able fold the pant legs back up to my waste. My suggestion is, don't bother.",

The pockets are deep enough but aren't tall enough if that makes sense; meaning that whatever you put in your pocket is absolutely glued to your legs which is uncomfortable. This therefore demands you outright exclude your regular front pockets to feel even moderately comfortable which is insane for pants that are supposed to promote utility.  And no this isn't an isolated incident; I purchased 5 of these cargo pants for work, and 5 of these pants have provided the same experience. If these issues would be fixed I would buy 5 more for just for fashion, but instead all 5 will be returned.  This is the perspective of someone who is wearing a 38"" W 32"" L and this size is comfortable for me; not too loose, not too tight of course.",
