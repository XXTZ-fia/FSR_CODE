The fabric is nice and light and the pattern is really pretty.  The fabric has this wavy texture that makes it unique.  It has a nice V neck and the sleeves are a good length...I hate too short long sleeves.  It does have a button cuff, but it's not tight on the wrist, in fact it's pretty loose.  The length is great...it covers the butt and is just this shy of being a tunic length.  It's a loose enough fit that it drapes nicely.  The only problem is the way it's sewn just under the V neck.  It has this little bit of a fold and then falls loose.  But I don't know if the way it's sewn is incorrect on just this shirt or it's just a flaw, but under the V neck when you move it creates a little bulge in the fabric, almost like it's too tight across the bust, but it isn't.  It's very noticeable, but that could be because of the texture of the fabric or the print.  Another color may not have the same issue.  I will be returning, but I wish I didn't have to because I love all of the other elements of the shirt.",2
