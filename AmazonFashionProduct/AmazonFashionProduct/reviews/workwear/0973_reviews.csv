To be clear, the fit was perfect and I have no actual proof that this shirt is the reason I didn’t book that audition.  But it was.  I’m sure it’s great for wearing as an actual paramedic, or for other auditions for different shows or a movie about a paramedic or just with a paramedic in it.  But someone watching my tape must have thought “I hate this shirt and by extension the man wearing it.” Because I could have killed that role and everyone knows it.  4/5 stars.",4

The only reason I say that and to me it was not a big deal was the plastic that the shirt came in was not intact. The shirt is very long. So if you have a long torso this shirt will fit you nicely. If you have an average torso like me then it will be a dress. I purchased and extra large for the comfort factor and to allow for some shrinkage over multiple washes.

The shirt was delivered within 36 hours of placing the order, so that was great!  Upon opening the package, the shirt was packaged neatly and folded in a plastic bag.  When I opened it all up, I was first pleased with the very sharply white color and the QUALITY polyester material. It looks like it will last for many years.  I also liked the very slight sheen to the material. Truly a sharp-looking white shirt. The buttons are also a nice size and WHITE, not the normal pearlesque of most shirt buttons. I think the white buttons add to the sharpness of the look.  I tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly.  XXL  My wife will be putting the patches and insignia on the shirt soon.
