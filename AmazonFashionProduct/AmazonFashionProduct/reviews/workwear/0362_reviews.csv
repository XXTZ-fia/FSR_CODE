Not sure if these are from inexperienced welders and they're welding way too hot or what.  I've built a firewood cart and finished up a small dump trailer while wearing this shirt, probably 30-45 min of total weld time, not one burn mark on it.  I have welded many times in a short sleave shirt, yeah the sparks sting a little for a couple of seconds but my goodness, I didn't run around telling everybody I got an ""ouchie"". I mainly purchased this shirt to properly protect my arms from the UV coming off the weld.  It was very dumb of me to ever weld in a short sleave shirt (one time in a wife beater, I didn't make that mistake twice).  Every welding shirt I've had (expensive ones included), if a big enough spark lands in a fold or otherwise where it can't fall off, it's going to burn a hole through it, period.  That is no reason to claim they aren't flame/fire retardant. These are FLAME/FIRE RETARDANT shirts, simply means they are difficult to set on fire.  The other complaint I don't understand it about the shirts being too long or too big, they're welding shirts, they're supposed to be that way.  I wear XL and ordered XL and it fit like I expected it too.  Sleaves plenty long, shirt long and loose fit.  I leave it on a hanger in the office of my shop and put it on over whatever shirt I'm wearing when I weld.  Button down pockets are a must and these are great.  When grinding or cutting I would have to put on my leather apron to keep from wearing out the front of the thighs on my jeans.  This shirt is long enough to keep the sparks off my jeans. I wish this shirt had a sleeve pocket for marking tools, that is my only complaint.  So, if you're new to welding, give this shirt a try.  It will burn through in the right circumstances but that's welding for you.",7
