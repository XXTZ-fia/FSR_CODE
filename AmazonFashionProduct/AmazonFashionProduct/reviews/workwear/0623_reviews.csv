I was looking for good quality, 100% cotton, medium weight long sleeve shirts for less than $25, which is asking a lot these days. The shirt itself is ""normal"" fit, as in I usually wear medium and this medium fit me well (6ft, 185lbs). It is as long as the pictures show, proceeding well past the waist, a little too far to me. I'd call it medium-heavyweight, as it's not as heavy as some Dickie's style workshirts. Quality is high, especially for the price. Hopefully this thing softens up soon but I suspect it is what it is and may soften after about 1000 washes and the color has faded into oblivion.",

I do not advise going the blueberry smurf route and wearing these with standard colored jeans (the Blue Shirt, at Least).  Wears thick and nicely enough for autumn. It fits only slightly larger than I expected, as i had a t shirt underneath and it was still quite loose, but it's fine if we have restrictions again and I go through another 'well, one more pint of ice cream...I'll just...exercise...by pacing...sometime' mode.  The pocket works out well even while buttoned for those of us at times who wish to put our glasses in a front pocket. This shirt after washings shows no ill affects or fading. It is built to last.",

It is about a mile and a half long, so there is no chance it will come untucked. You would not want to wear it untucked, at the risk of it looking like a dress. Would recommend though.

It's 100% cotton, and though the product description indicates it is ""medium thickness"", to me it feels a little heavier than medium.  When first put on, I definitely the shirt to be soft and comfortable.  Those are 2 qualities that are a ""must"" for me.  The shirt is a button-down, and also has 6 vertical buttons on the front.  The sleeves on the shirt have 2 buttons on each sleeve.  If there is anything about the shirt that I did not like, it was the buttons and buttonholes.  The buttons were almost too large for the holes, and I found it difficult to button the shirt.Generally, I am 5'10"" and weigh between 180 and 195 depending on the season.  During the fall and winter, my weight tends to be on the upper end of the range, so I ordered an XL in the shirt.  It fits perfectly.BOTTOM LINE:  This medium to heavy thickness shirt is a great addition to one's cooler weather wardrobe.  It comes in several colors and is certainly appropriate for casual to business casual wear.  Other than the button holes which seem to be too small, this is a really good shirt.  I would order it again.",

Mitchell M.,Casual wear with formal wear detailing and soft material.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R60H0TRNTM9C1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09652PP2D,"5.0 "," the United States "," August 19, 2021",,,"This is a very well-made shirt, and the material and detailing is more like that of an oxford-style dress shirt than one for casual wear. The material has a tight weave, and it's very soft. The seaming is flawless everywhere - from the inseams to the buttonholes. The three-button cuffs fit perfectly, and the end-cuffs are weighted just right for rolling up and looking neat. I like the dual pockets, and the left one is perfect for keeping my reading glasses safe while driving. So, my seat belt isn't crunching my glasses. I appreciate that. The collar has the same weight as the cuffs. It stays upright, and also lays out evenly for a neater look when the top button is undone. I gave this a vigorous hand-washing, some fabric softener, and line-drying before wearing. It would have required ironing for neatness if I were going somewhere semi-formal, but as an unbuttoned over-shirt on top of a formal tee, it looked great. A little rumpled, a little formal, but classic and natural. As far as the fit, it's the perfect length for tucking, but it's not too long for outer-wear. A few bonuses here are the spare buttons, and the hanging loop inside the collar. I'm really pleased with the feel, quality, and attention to detail of this shirt.",3
