David Perry,Fell Apart. Stiching on arm came out,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19W48HFHVUUGQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B078HTK69J,"1.0 "," the United States "," December 18, 2024",Size: X-LargeColor: Khaki,Verified Purchase,Love the jacket but it fell apart after a few months of light wear. Bought it in late spring and used it a bit then hung it back up till this fall then the arm started to unravel. Contacted the supplyer and the said they could not help because it had been so long. Coat looks mostly brand new other than the sleeve is falling off.  No more WenVen products for me. Seems foolish for a $54  jacket to loose a customer for and obvious flaw in manufacturing,

People said order the Medium - That it would be like a 'slim fit large'. That was the correct way to do it. The medium fits me like a slim fit large. That is what I was looking for. I know that if I got the large it would be a different type of look. I wanted something that looked cool and slimming. Medium was perfect for that. My concern was not warmth, my concern was style. (It is warm though.) This is good quality. This is a real deal for the price. I ended buying additional ones in every style, dark green and black. I have like 8 of them now. The sleeves run a bit long which for me adds to the slim fit vibe. All good.",5

DougA,Great jacket once you get the wrinkles out of it,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9DK21IMBGXO3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B078HTK69J,"4.0 "," the United States "," November 27, 2019",,Verified Purchase,"I love this jacket!  It fits great, especially if you plan to wear it unzipped most of the time.  I'm a bit bigger around the middle than I should be (5'5"" 165lbs) and it's just a bit snug if I zip it up.  It's got a good, solid feel to it with a rugged denim-type fabric on the outside.  Being a bit smaller in stature, I often struggle to find clothes that the sleeves aren't too long, and this jacket fits darned-near perfectly.As for length, the bottom hem of the jacket falls just about 4"" below my belt (again, I'm 5'5"" tall).My one complaint (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that it came out of the package EXTREMELY wrinkled.  I spent about an hour and fifteen minutes working to get most of the wrinkles out of it.  The collar was crumpled and it took a good deal of work and some starch to get it to straighten out... and it's still not perfect.It's a great jacket for those low-40's to mid-50s days.  It won't suffice for our long, cold Idaho winters, but come spring I'll be wearing it again.",2

""WenVen Men's Fall Casual Army Lightweight Jacket (Black)"" AKA ""WenVen Men's Fall Casual Army Warm Jacket with Pockets (Black)"" is a nice jacket, but it's a little large for a large, particularly the arms are about an inch longer than I'd prefer. Typically, large jackets fit me well and I wear size medium shirts (I'm 5' 11"", 190 lbs). The zipper catches a little sometimes, which I suspect is due to sharp metal edges, similar to a newly cut key, and it's a brighter gold color than the pictures suggest. Otherwise, the quality is fine. One last comment, the polyester lining is army green, which is not apparent in the pictures, but it doesn't matter to me because the lining isn't visible when wearing it.  Potentially, I'd buy this again, but it would definitely be a medium.",14
