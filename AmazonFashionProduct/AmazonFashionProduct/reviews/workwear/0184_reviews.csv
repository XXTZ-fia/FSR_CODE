The black pair ankle holes were so small i thought I was going to rip the fabric putting them on, they were skin tight through the calf but very loose from knee to mid thigh, fit great (nice and loose/comfy) everywhere else. The heather grey pair is the only one I'm keeping, but they are still strangely loose around the knees. This was the most stiff fabric, very swishy and the least stretchy. The burgundy are more pink than red in opinon, which is a deal breaker for me. But they are sort of in the middle of the other two fits: I could get them on (not easily) and were moderately tight through the knee, enough you look like you're wearing jodhpurs. These were also the stretchiest of the 3 pairs, by a lot, which I liked, the fabric was a bit softer too. I am 5'7"" 145#, relatively beefy lower body, but my calves aren't freakish or anything, so I don't know what happened there... Also tried a large pair, which were huge, and I generally like my pants to fit loose.",

However... This is the first time I have bought a 3XL that feels way too big. Anyway, it's not all bad. There's more pros, but one issue was a deal breaker for me. Maybe this is more designed for male than ot is for female because there's just too much room ""down"" there.  Pros: 1. The measurement is accurate, 2. Feels nice on the stomach 3. Plenty nice room around the legs 2. Good inseam, plenty of room for adjustment-- so tall or short person can wear (just cut the excess fabric)  Cons: 1. The rise is way too deep. Like deeeeeep, it almost reached the top of my leg! Which then defies the purpose of buying it in the first place (avoiding friction between legs).  Just because it feels to deep for me doesn't mean it would be too deep for another person. So I've attached some photos for reference.",
