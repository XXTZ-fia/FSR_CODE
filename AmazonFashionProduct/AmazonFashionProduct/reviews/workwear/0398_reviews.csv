Super soft and it will be a great shirt for spring and fall but I will stick with my heavy flannels for winter. The colors are awesome. Not too bright but not dull at all. I liked it enough to buy a second one, so I do highly recommend this flannel. Just expect something between a cotton shirt and a heavy flannel and you will be thrilled. Nothing bad to say but not what I expected for a flannel.",
